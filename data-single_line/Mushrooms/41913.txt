This is really long already, so Ill quickly tell a couple funny/scary things that happened and then the really challenging part of the trip. I found myself in a more open area, and there was a truck ahead collecting branches or something. I didnt really want to get involved in any social interactions but thought it would look weirder to turn around and walk the other way. As I got closer I saw one person talking to another. Their voice was garbled and alien and impossible to understand, and they seemed to have weird sickle or a paddle in their hands. I couldnt tell which way their face was oriented and it seemed to shift. This was pretty stressful because I had no idea where I was or if I was even allowed to be going in this direction, but I soldiered through trying to look normal. Everything was fine obviously and I felt relieved as I walked past unharmed. As I got a bit further some dog walkers joined my path quite close behind, and they must have had bells on their collars or something because it sounded just like Santas sleigh.
