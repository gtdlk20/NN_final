I could have sat there for hours, just drinking up Jimi's riffs, with a stupid smile wide enough to make my ears fall off. Well, he (my provider) had to go to sleep. It was late for him, so I moved on. During the walk from his location to mine, I got that classic feeling that people were looking at me. Not like they thought I was high, however. It was like I felt for the first time I saw, all around, people looking at me when they thought I didn't see them looking. Who knows what that was all about. It got to the point where I felt I was altering events just by my presence, like I was a mote, determining possibilities, and people whirled around me and did things they would not have done had I not been around.
