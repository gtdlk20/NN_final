Matt and I shared our thoughts and conclusions from the trip like we generally do after such an experience.  I reflected on my momentary moment of weakness, a little ashamed by it but glad that it was such a slap in the face as to what actually could happen to me when dealing with shrooms, experience with psychedelics aside.  It started getting a little cold so we made our way back to the tent.  Seth was quiet when we go there but after about ten seconds of silence he said hey guys, Ive found enlightenment and continued laughing like a madman. He was a little more under control, and I even managed to talk to him a little bit later about what he was thinking, and his continued mushroom trip, continuing hours after mine despite the fact that he didnt consume his entire eighth. The man is incredibly sensitive to the stuff, Ive learned.
