Having him there helped me, he took the same amount but after yakking and crapping (things I never did do during either session) was just fine and ready to be my personal shaman.  As I started the slide out of my body he was there to calmly ask me annoying questions concerning how bad it really was that I was getting ready to go 'bye-bye'.  When that moment finally came, a blue-print style grid in yellow of the whole room lifted up and spun off into space like some Twilight Zone shit, my friend started to break up and dissolve as if he was being teleported away from me and the whole, somewhat dark, room turned into a universe of stars.  I was still able to fight it though and spent the next 4 hours swimming on my carpet, coming back in loops of total awake to deep dreaming/riding the fractal patterns of universe and information. I could NOT get off the floor for about 5 hours!  The singing bowl was my savior for awhile as it created a huge river of light that I was swimming through in my head.  It helped me set loose a LOT of anxieties by keeping my body moving with all of this energy.  While inside of this madness I started to think of my enemies and they seemed like my newborn son did 14 years ago, beautiful little naive beings.  Being in this non-ordinary reality is what I now call the, 'cosmic stomping'.  It really scrubbed me out.  I notice that music and sex both seem like they did when I was 14 again.  The world itself is a brighter place and my life-long depression and 3-year long stomach problems have vanished, probably due to my lack of alcohol, and so it is with holistic healing.
