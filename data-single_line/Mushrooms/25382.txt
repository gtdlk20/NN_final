At some time during the movie, everything went downhill.  The faces in the movie would slowly start to decay right before my eyes until they were nothing but mere skeletons with flesh hanging from them.  It was amazing, but I was so afraid I'd never escape these beasts.  It was so incredibly frightening.  I felt my face grow cold.  It felt as if there was no blood in my face.  I started to sweat, then feel cold, then sweat, then feel cold.
