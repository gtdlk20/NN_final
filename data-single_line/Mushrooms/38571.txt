It was a night that is impossible to forget. Memories of that night invoke dark twisted images of sinister demons as well as the light of divine spirits. It was a near death experience as it was a rebirth. Although it may have been reckless and irresponsible, nature taught me a thing or two about life.  It was the night before the fourth of July. Colorful clusters of explosion filled the sky. I felt like doing something crazy. So I called up a two of my friends, and broke out the stash of magick mushrooms I had purchased recently. They were supposedly very potent and powerful, but that didnt scare me. I had enough to supply ten people. But I only gave my two friends a meager portion, and I greedily devoured the rest. I even remember saying, Ill eat this last shroom to make me regret it, and indeed I would.
