We were prepared to journey into the world of mushrooms. We each had bottle water with us, so we wouldn't risk getting dehydrated. About 25-30 minutes after ingestion of the mushrooms, I laid down on the couch and started laughing, not hysterically loud, but just kinda laughing to myself. I knew this was the first feeling of the psilocybe taking over. It almost felt like we just smoked a bowl, but we didnt (kind of weird to explain).
