Now here, I am unsure who this comment was directed to, still to this day it makes me wonder. [There was a moment where I also said in a state of tolerance, You have to let go. I said this in such a state of love and forgiveness as Mom and as Me Lying in the Bed, as well as Inner Self.] As I stated prior, it may be numerous things including a direct message to the human race (since I am everyone). As Drunvalo Melchzedek says, this disharmonic level of consciousness of 44 and 2 chromosomes will kill any planet it inhabits. When the baby is born the baby must be cut from the cord, it must let go. This was the most enigmatic of all the comments from Mother/me.
