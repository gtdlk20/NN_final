I had felt so drunk the night before but had no hangover or anything in the morning, I found however that my body had been literally drained of all it's energy; my legs wouldn't work for a while, they just didn't move the way they're supposed to, at one point they simply gave out and I crashed to the floor like a drunk, this same thing happened with my hands.
