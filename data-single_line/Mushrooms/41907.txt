As I come over the top of one of the small hills I see a small herd of cows/bulls, one of which was on the path while the others were dotted around in the ferns and surrounding area. I walked toward the one by the path and said hello from a distance, hoping to get close enough to touch it. It didnt seem very pleased about my being there and approaching it, so it began to walk toward the others who were down a narrower path that branched off the one I was on. As it reached that path it looked up and seemed to gesture with its head as though it wanted me to follow. I thought about how cool it would be if the animals just accepted me because they could tell I meant no harm and was tripping, but I remembered a funny story told by Alan Watts about a kid disciple to some Guru who when told he was the Brahman and therefore thought himself invincible, and who after ignoring the calls from the rider of an elephant, ended up getting bashed off the road into a spiky ditch. When he confronted the guru and said he had lied, that he wasnt the eternal Brahman and could therefore be hurt, the guru told him he should have listened to the rider and gave way to the elephant because they too are the Brahman. I carried on walking and didnt try touch the cows. My legs felt ridiculously powerful and I felt dangerous and animalistic, like nobody could hurt me out here because I could give as good as they could. I was very keenly aware of the advantage of being a man.
