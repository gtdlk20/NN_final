I felt like talking to someone. So I went down to my aunt's room. Her room has a door leading outside, and one to the house, but the one to the house is blocked off because her cat learned to open it, and she doesn't want her to get pregnant by my cat. So I walked around my house, which was definatly the most trippy experience of my life. I have these giant bush-like trees, that looked like giant sculpted spiders. The leaves on my bushes looked like they were rippling. And the house across from me had a giant orange glowing tree in their front yard, that had never been there before. It was about 8-8:30ish. So it was quite dark, but I wasn't afraid, only curious.
