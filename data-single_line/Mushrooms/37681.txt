The roommate left again to go to one of his friend's apartment elsewhere, and I wandered into one of the bedrooms in the apartment I was in.  The room was completely dark except for the window which let some light in.  I collapsed onto the floor and just rolled around for a while till I ended up on my back.  Before I knew it, my hands were back to having a mind of their own.  I was helpless as they felt their way all over my face, but this time was different, for I didn't think they were going to hurt me.  My buddy walked into the room some time later to grab some of his things and I stood up as best I could and looked at him, grinning. He asked me if I was still boomin, and I said 'yeah... I don't know what I'm seeing, but it all makes perfect sense.' he laughed and said, 'well, I hope you figure it out.'
