After what felt like the longest three hours, I started to feel better.  I began to warm up and feel more comfortable and relaxed.  The experience began to resemble the one I had had a few days previously but I was in no position to enjoy it.  About six hours after initial ingestion I felt normal again but also felt completely worn out.  Psychologically, I was fine but still a bit worried that I had done myself some harm.
