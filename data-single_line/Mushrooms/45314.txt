T = 5:30  We arrived on campus, and everyone except for JP and I went to the dining hall to eat dinner. We headed back to our building, and I chilled in JPs room for a while, where I solved Rubiks cube a few times, and taught JP how to do the same. I was very impatient with him, and eventually I just snatched it out of his hand to do it.
