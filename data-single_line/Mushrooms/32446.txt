We wander around and find our way to the top of a big rock / headland / island thingy. This place seems very central to the overall area and we have a 360-degree view. We are a safe distance from everyone else, no one can overhear our conversation but we can see everyone. People are coming out to play! Families, couples, a man on a kayak, a fat lady with an outrageous brightly coloured sombrero hat. A fat man in a wet suit who tried spear fishing...he had so much gear on including a bright orange floating buoy. He looked so ridiculous; we laughed and laughed at him. The man in the kayak was also laughing at him.
