At around 3:00 that afternoon we started to come down from the effects. Things stopped moving so much and our thought processes dramatically cleared. We were able to understand what was happening around us in the 'real world' and were able to coherantly talk to one another. The patterns of letters began to reduce although I could still see them if I looked. After the trip our spirits were high and we were both very happy. Laughing, joking with one another and talking about what we had seen. I asked my girlfriend what had been taught to her from the trip, she said 'Trust'. When she asked me the same thing I told her 'Happiness'. The world is a very beautiful place, and nothing can teach this more than mushrooms. I have been forever changed.
