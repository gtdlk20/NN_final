When I closed my eyes, I saw evolving patterns that were pretty colourful, and it was almost as if I was taken to a different world when I closed my eyes and became engrossed in the visuals. When I opened them again, I noted that the pictures on the wall were morphing slightly, and the blue flashes of lightning looked super cool, almost as if the energy produced by them was entering the room in full force, but not in an aggressive manner, more an appreciation of mother nature. The thunder was in the distance and so also wasn't threatening. In fact, if I could have chosen to make the lightning and thunder stop, I wouldn't have done. I liked it being here with us tonight.
