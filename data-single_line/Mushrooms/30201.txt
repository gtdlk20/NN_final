Me and one of my team members decide to go to a local mexican restaurant to get some post bowling munchies. I get there and decide to order the 15 dollar order of nachos that is made for like four people, when there is only me and one friend. We get the nachos and about 3 chips in I lose interest and want to go home. Holding interest in food when I have been on mushrooms has always been a hard task for me. Other motivating factors were the heavy visuals that I was still having, seeing many other people in the restaurant with deformed faces.
