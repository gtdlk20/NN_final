I decided to watch television. I put on The Office to keep away any sort of paranoia (very small hints of paranoia were cropping up (not the best setting. Outside with friends during the daytime would have been MUCH better), but not very much). I remember the essence of this experience, and it's hard to describe. Very.. peaceful. Very harmonious with everything. Subtle, yet beautiful. Very easygoing and forward-going. Anyway, I noticed that Jim's lips on The Office were red. Like, insanely red. I mean, that guy's got some red lips (watching again, they look only pink :p )
