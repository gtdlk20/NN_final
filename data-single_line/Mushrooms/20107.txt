The planetarium was where I felt like my life changed.  I was sitting there, waiting for the show to start when I hit my peak.  The lights and lines started moving around, and all the sounds of people talking ceased to be words and turned into pure sounds flowing all around and through me.  I was exhilarated at the new world around me.  My mind was running at 9000 rpms.  The show started, but I didnÂ’t even know what was on the screen; I had delved into my own thoughts and was furiously plowing through them.  I had never felt so alive or so in touch with reality around me.  I realized that my thoughts up to this point had been so confined and boxed in, and I had just blasted open the doors of perception and consciousness.  I hit a single point where I realized that my life would be different from this day forward, and everything was going to be wonderful, and it felt more overwhelming than anything I had ever felt before.  It was almost scary.  I just kept furiously thinking about anything and everything.
