So we started walking back on this vast frozen lake and I decided to let the others go ahead. I often like to be away from people when I'm really high because I feel that others have away of bringing me down. I especially favor silence in order to come up. And I started to come up really quickly. Soon my freinds were just little dots ahead in a sea of white and I was starting to have elevated thoughts while simoultaneously losing my sense of where I was and what was going on. I can remember looking up and seeing a helicopter fly overhead and I felt like the helicopter was just a little bee and I was a huge giant. But this perception was just entertainment. Eventually I hit the edge of the lake where the path went into the forest.
