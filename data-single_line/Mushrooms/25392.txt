My legs became weightless.  I couldn't figure out whose body I was in.  I decided I was going to try and control this.  I sat and payed close attention to every detail in the movie.  After a while, I was simply enjoying the movie.  As soon as I realized I wasn't panicing anymore, I'd get afraid that it would come back.  This would make me panic again.  It was a neverending chain of panic and euphoria.
