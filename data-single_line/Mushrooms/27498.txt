For several minutes I laughed at our absurdity, repeating over and over Its so simple.  Time passed, the Sun set, the Rock grew cold.  We left the Rock then and of course it was a little sad.  The rest of my trip was quite hectic, as upon our arrival back at the cabin it appeared that one of my friends had gone over the deep end and was left in some sort of insane, completely lost and shroomed out state of mind.  That story is for another writing, but Ill give you an example of the site I was confronted with upon my re-entry into our chaotic shroom room:  my friend had one hand submerged in a fishbowl that he occasionally sipped off of full of orange juice, cigarette butts, and pine needles , and the other hand shoved in a kleenex box;  his once pristine clothing was covered in an inch of dirt and muck, and he was screaming at the top of his voice I am an Action Figure!
