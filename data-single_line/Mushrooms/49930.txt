I shroomed a lot during my junior year in high school, but the last time had been in April 2001. It was now August 2001 and shrooms had come into town. I love the shrooming experience and couldn't wait. There was a big football game that night, so I stopped in for a few minutes and left. I went and bought some cigarettes, some gas, and some orange juice, and I munched down on the entire 4 grams. I drank a big glass of orange juice. I hadn't eaten all day so the shrooms and orange juice didn't have anything to get in their way. Almost 15 minutes after I took them I felt all giggley and I was so psyched! I knew this was going to be a good, fun, heavy trip.
