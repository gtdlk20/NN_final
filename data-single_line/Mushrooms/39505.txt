At about t+45, RP and I went to sit by a big campfire in the clearing that several people were gathered around.  I was feeling disappointed with the mushrooms at this point.  The slight visual alteration and positive feelings were nice, but certainly not anything like I had read about.  I decided to get over it and enjoy the experience while it lasted, maybe try out the whole 'social' thing for once.  this is when I met the hippie chick...i'll refer to her as HC. it turned out that RP and HC knew each other, and RP informed her that this was my 'first time'.  Upon hearing this she walked me around the fire and introduced me to another guy who was also first-timing with mushrooms, and told us to talk to each other.  The guy was out of his mind, and frightened.  He sat down by the fire and stared at the ground for a very long time.
