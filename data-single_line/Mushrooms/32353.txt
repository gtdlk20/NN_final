Alot of this trip I have to blame on very poor setting. The plan was to go down by a river where we thought we would be left alone. We didn't know it was a common place for people to go for walks, ect. We started by hiking down to the river, we set up our chairs around some rocks near the river, we each had 4 grams of very high grade mushrooms (we had no idea they were so potent, I told my dealer I ate 4 grams and he didn't believe me), mixed them up with some chips and salsa, and chowed them down. While we waited for them to kick in, we decided to smoke some marijuana. About 10 minutes had passes, I felt very giggly, more so then normaly from weed. Immediately after some people going for a walk, walked behind us. We all agreed this was a bad spot. We picked up camp and decided to move about 50 meters down the river, away from the path.
