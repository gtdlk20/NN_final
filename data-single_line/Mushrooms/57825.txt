I was beginning to feel it, and I was having a good time, then, all of a sudden, I got really light headed and fell to the ground.  I closed my eyes, hoping that it might help me feel better, but when I opened them back up and stood up, I found myself facing something that it completely unexplainable.  Before me I saw women and men, dressed as though they were in a ballroom, wearing tuxeodos and ballgowns.  There was an orchestra playing beautiful music.  I stood there in horror, because first, I didnt know where any of my friends were, I was staring into the faces of strangers.  Everywhere I looked, there were unfamiliar faces, scary faces, sad faces.  Everything began to get really fuzzy, and I passed out.  I woke up to loud screaming drum and bass music, with my head and shirt soaked in sweat, and I began to have mild seizures.  I shook so violently that my friends assumed that they should take me to the hospital, but considering the conditions that I was in, they decided against a hospital visit.  I shook violently for about 3.5 hours, and then I passed out again.
