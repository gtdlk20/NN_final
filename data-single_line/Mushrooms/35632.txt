Finally, everything calmed a little.  My fractured vision continued for nearly five hours.  But at least after several hours I was able to move around again.  At this point my best friend called to check on me.  She had known I was tripping alone and wanted to make sure I was alright.  We talked for several minutes and she asked me if I had recieved any profound insights.  I tried to explain what I was experiencing.  Finding the correct words, however, was nearly impossible.
