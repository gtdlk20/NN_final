The scene seems to play in reverse, although it feels just fine.  I see even more primitive primates.  They are unable to verbally communicate, a mere animal.  I see them consume the mushroom.  The mushroom stimulates them, it gives them ideas.  It teaches them to talk.  It teaches them to love one another.  I feel now, that what gave humans intelligence was the psychedelic experience. At this point, I feel so awestruck, I realize that I am receiving this information from no other than God.  God is not a person, a thing, a place.  God is every person, everything, every bit of this existence that we know. I feel Gods love.  I love him back.  I thank him for his wisdom, we embrace each other for a lengthy period of time.  He shows me heaven, and it is wonderful.  He sends me on my way back, in a different path.
