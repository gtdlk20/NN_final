It was then that I feel I regressed into a childlike state of consciousness which i inhabited blissfully before I used words. My thoughts were no longer translated into the contemporary human speech which I am using to write this report. Rather, my being was pure. I was unburdened by the vain contrivances of adult society. I was a toddler, euphoric and free in a magical wonderland filled with goats and grass and mud.
