T +3:45 Many people start showing up at Lisas house and I am a little uncomfortable with some of the unfamiliar faces.  Everyone is immediately able to discern that I am tripping.  I see E and J talking together in a corner of the basement and decide that it would be nice to be alone with other trippers.  I sit down and immediately realize that I have a profound connection with the both of them.  The ability that I have to understand what they are thinking and vice versa borders on telepathy.  We all find each other finishing the others sentences or even understanding things merely based on looks.  I can hear their thoughts forming in my head.
