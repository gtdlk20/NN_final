What I thought was going to be a waste of perfectly good shrooms actually turned out to be quite a unique experience that focused mainly on the physical and mental aspects, opposed to the visuals. The way I looked at it then, and still look at it now, is that I decided that I wasn't just going to witness hallucinations, but become them; merge with them in one big orgasmic dance of physical contortions beneath the covers of my bed. I eagerly await my next trip, which will most likely be this weekend or next. All I can say about this trip was that I was liberated from my normal mental functioning and my normal physical behavior. And I wouldn't change this experience one bit...except maybe the nasty taste of those shrooms! ;)
