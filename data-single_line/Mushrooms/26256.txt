I hung up the phone, and lay in my bed. I didn't have any Grateful Dead, so instead I put on some Tarbox Ramblers, a really great folk rock group. However, the music made me want to kill myself again, and I couldn't take it. Anything I played was horrible, and certainly not the Grateful Dead, so I turned all my music off. I turned all my lights off. I turned my computer off. In doing this, I seemed to turn the bad trip off. I turned the world off.
