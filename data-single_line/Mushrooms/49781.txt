When N started looking at a candy bag that's lying on the floor he starts telling us to look at it to see that it lives. It changes forms and moves around, but I can't see it so I decide to lay down on the bed to relax a little. Suddenly I get the idea that I have to drop a pillow on my face, I can't remember why. After dropping the pillow on my face for a few minutes I started thinking: 'Why am I doing this?', and I stop. A while thereafter I remember that I HAVE TO find out why I did what I did with the pillow. I start dropping it on my face once again. After a minute or two I decide that I will never remember why I felt like I had to do it.
