Almost 2 hours after consumption, after the pillow incident, I don't see the patterns in the bottle anymore. N thinks that the coca cola is tired, that it is just resting, but I don't agree. I think it is mad at me for drinking out of the bottle and that's why I doesn't want to show its patterns to me anymore. By this time I found out that the tree that called for me before belonged to someone else. I came to the conclusion: 'It is not my tree, I can't go to it'.
