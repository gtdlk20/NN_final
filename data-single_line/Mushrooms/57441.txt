After waiting a few hours my shrooms had finally arrived at 11:45ish. Me, my friend K, D, and Z all ate up our shrooms and waited for the first effects. Within ten minutes the body high kicked into gear and giggling as well. We all started to play a video game and i started to feel rather strange as did my friend K and we both let go of the controlers and handed them over. We both picked comfotable spots and just stared at the ceiling which was needless to say very different. The roof began taking on shapes and patterns and what seemed to be a cloud forming where the roof was. Although this was bizzare it's something like you would see if you took DXM. The first thing that really started to make me trip was my friend K, he looked at me and said 'how do you feel' and his voice sort of driffted off as the last words came out of his mouth. His face was like something I had never seen before, very disstorted, he kind of looked like Frankenstein and sort of cartoonish. All four of us took a walk downstairs so we could try to trip harder.
