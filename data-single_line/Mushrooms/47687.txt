My friend Dillan and I had been very interested in the psychedelic side of life for a long time and we had both wanted to try mushrooms or acid for quite a while. We had both been smoking bud for a couple of years and although it was still pleasurable, it was getting boring just sitting in smoking and listening to Pink Floyd all night. We decided on mushrooms and I took on the task of growing them, and didn't tell him I was until they were ready.
