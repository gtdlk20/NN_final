The next morning was not bad at all. I still felt very sensitive and sympathetic towards almost everything. Even the childrenÂ’s good night story on the radio took me emotionally. But at the same time, I was positively looking forward to the challenges that lay ahead (studying, new job). I spent two other days in the cabin, chilling and just enjoying myself. But also realizing that it was more than enough of the mushrooms and I would have to do a lot. And to let the impressions being settled before I would take them again.
