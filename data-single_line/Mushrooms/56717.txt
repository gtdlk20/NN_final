After 3 hours of going insane, crying and shaking my friends returned to get me and my boyfriend at the time.  My friend Mike was also going insane asking everyone the question..'Am I real...what is real?'  We had to leave him behind because he could not handle the walk we were about to take.  Once I left the room and went outside I felt much better.  We walked around and I felt extremely close to the people I was with.
