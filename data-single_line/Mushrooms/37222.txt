The shrooms didn't completely wear off until around noon the next day, which adds up to a roughly 16 hour experience. I blame/accredit this to my completely empty stomach and delirium from being awake so long; I DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone try this without a lot of experience with psychadelics, and a readiness to be completely blown away a million-fold with the intensity of it. I am surprised I had a good time at all, let alone such an amazing one.
