After maybe 10 minutes of sucking on ice cubes from the cooler hoping the water would ease my stomach I'm just out of it and I start feeling very plain in my head like I'm not tripping but I still am and it shouldn't be this intense but I don't feel high so I go, not able to walk straight T and D have to hold me up as I attempt to grab a bud light lime(which I didn't even want) and the frosted mini wheat cereal I forgot I had hoping maybe it would calm me down, they bring me over to my seat. I I start getting scared with the feeling I start getting in my head ,I'm also not hearing a word any of my friends are saying and I'm trying to string together sentences which feels impossible. By this time its pitch black and the light from the fire is causing these 'sun streaks' in my eyes causing my to bury my head in my hands with these streaks lasting a few seconds with my eyes closed and all of a sudden out of no where it feels like when you get hit in the head and see stars or when you stand up too quick and get dizzy (this is what my brain feels like the rest of the night) I'm thinking I fucked myself this time. All I can remember for the next hour is getting these traveling lights everytime I look at the fire and and everytime I look into the darkness. I'm also being stuck in conflict with myself about weather I should take a drink of my beer or a frosted mini wheat and this leaves me sitting with the two in front of me for I don't even know how long just debating on what I want ,at the same time telling myself I have a good life and friends, While being scared about fucking my brain up telling myself it's just the psilocybin doing this. I than look out into the trees hoping to stop my thoughts and looking at the trees in the distance (it's completely black out) they start morphing into this huge spider god coming to get us and I'm looking at it and as my mood changes from scared to totally accepted of it being their I look over to the fire again and swear I shifted my seat a few feet to the left which leaves me confused as hell, than look back at my 'spider god' which is still their and now has baby spiders climbing around everywhere and I stare in amazement and out of no wear I get energy to stand up grabbing a stick out of the fire and I start walking back and forth, feeling like I'm a wizard and using it as a walking stick (it's completely on fire exept for wear I'm holding) feeling magic in the thing and pretending to blow stuff up by slamming it on the ground like I'm the wizard of this forest and these are the monsters you need to get through.
