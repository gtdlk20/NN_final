T:: (1:40pm) This is the only time Ill give exact time because a promise of our trip was to avoid a clock until we were done, since all perception of time is usually lost. We decided to go to campus.  We have a very beautiful and old campus, with tons of foliage.  Its winter break so its empty on campus, and weve both tripped there before, and each time its a different, amazing experience.
