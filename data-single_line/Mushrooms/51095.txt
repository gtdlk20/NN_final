I was more or less alright after we watched tv for another hour or so.  I had regained most of my color and was able to move.  I could feel the mushrooms working now, but I wasn't in any kind of mood to take advantage of the trip.  Since I could move now, we thought it would be best to drop me off at home, so I could just take it easy.  I sat in my bed tripping out for about 3 hours before I was able to fall asleep.  It wasn't a good trip, but it wasn't really bad either.
