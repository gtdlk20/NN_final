For what seemed like a very long time (and in later analysis, was actually 2-2 Â½ hours) I went from lying with my face to the floor, inundated by the whirring machine-like sound, to sitting up and sighing heavily, to crawling around a bit, and then I would return to put my face to the floor.  There were just a few moments of lucidity during that period.
