My friend kept asking me how fucked I was and all I could say was 'I'm so fucked... I cant tell if I'm talking', and from then on we didnt say another word to each other, just sat and tripped in our own minds. I remember thinking if everyone else there was trippin out to... And how they were having such casual conversations when I could barely talk. All of a sudden I got the urge to go to the bathroom... Phew that was a long walk... As soon as I closed the door and turned around I seen myself in the mirror and I jumped back towards the door... My eyes were pure black... I couldnt even see the white... And I was wearing a black shirt so I looked so dark and scary... I stared into my eyes for what felt like 10 mintues but was truly only a second or two, and it scared me but I couldnt turn away... Finally I grabbed the doorknob and booked it back to my comfy seat on the couch, I couldnt go to the bathroom for the rest of the night because I was scared to see myself in the mirror. Everyonce in awhile I would touch my face and there were tears on it, and I couldnt tell if it was from yawning so much or cause I was crying... And I did feel like I had been crying... So I dunno...
