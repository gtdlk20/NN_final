Anyway, I had some mushrooms and they looked pretty damn good. I think they are some Thai strain like Koh Samui. I thought about whether I would eat some all afternoon, and finally around 5:00pm I ate half a peanut butter sandwich so I wouldn't have to eat the mushrooms on a completely empty stomach. Then I began powdering and gel-capping 1.8 grams of mushroom shake.
