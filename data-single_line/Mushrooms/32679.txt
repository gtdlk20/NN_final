I got out of school on friday, and me and my friends Joe, Cliff, and Lauren went to a headshop where I bought a nice glass bong. We hung out for a while and I was in a perfect mood. Joe and Cliff had to work, so they dropped me and Lauren at our houses. Lauren told me to call her if anything went wrong, and said just to call her for the hell of it if I wanted.
