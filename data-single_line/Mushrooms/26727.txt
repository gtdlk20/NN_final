8:45 P.M. I was listening to some music- Tiestos mix of Southern Sun I believe, and I was very joyful. Then, my roommate at the time came in. Our room was very small, and he came in, and sat right behind me. We had a very bad relationship. He was utterly inconsiderate (would turn off the lights when he would go to sleep at 9 PM and would never consider my sleep by banging the door whenever he left). We also had not spoken in weeks. Suddenly, my adrenaline surged. My teeth began to shake (more then they were already) and I got very cold. His presence was beginning to propel me into a state of panic and I began to have thoughts of permanent madness. Of course, I knew it wouldnt happen and in a few hours, I would feel fine again, but the setting had changed because he was in the mix.
