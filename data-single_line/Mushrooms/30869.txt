I wasnt born with a room temperature IQ. I approached this phase of life thoughtfully after finishing high-school and after reading Huxley, Cohen, Eddington, William Blake, et al. As a young man these writers, and my LSD experiences, left indelible impressions in my mind. I have no doubt that LSD stimulated my curiosity and actually raised my native intelligence significantly at a critical time in life. I still believe that this amazing chemical holds enormous potential for some members of the human race; especially for those rare individuals who seek a deeper insight, an alternate view, into this short phenomenon called life and are able to seek these insights with a clear conscience.
