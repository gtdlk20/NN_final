We discussed the experience of talking about his fathers death, and I started to make a point about how my dad is still alive, but I think I said, whats the difference or something to that effect.  It wasnt expressed to trivialize death.  For that moment, I think I truly could not discern the difference between being dead or alive.  Unable to truly understand dead and alive as two distinct things, I couldnt actually remember which state my father was in (hes alive).
