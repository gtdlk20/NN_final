Nate shouts, 'Dude, it's like 8:30, am I supposed to be tripping yet?' I immediately burst out laughing and fell to the ground. I began laughing deeply from inside myself uncontrollably, just at the thought of him not realizing that he was really high and hallucinating profusely. After almost five minutes of side splitting chuckles, I was able to regain some sanity and steadied myself on the sand. Then Stephen rushes over to me and he says, ' Oh my gosh Willie, are you O.K., you're crying!' I guess I was laughing so hard tears were streaming down my cheeks. I roared into another fit of hysterical laughter, this time at the thought of Stephen's concern for me. The visuals were pouring out all around me. My friends faces swirled and the dark forest behind me seemed to be the most paranoid and evil place for me to venture into. I could hear auditory hallucinations of Pete's laughter echoing as well. I was really starting to freak Nate and Steve out now, who were looking at me like I was gonna O.D. This of course only fueled my hysteria more and I was even starting to cackle. Nate was shaking me kinda violently going, 'Dude, pull yourself together, I don't want to have to take you to the ER!' Pete shoots me a strange look and I snap out of it. The ground seems to rumble a little and things get more serious.
