It is also scarier than anything I have ever experienced in 42 years.  I am glad that I no longer have access to shrooms.  I believe I am done for awhile.  Taking small dosages just to watch a movie or see a concert seems disrespectful to the mycelium.  Shamanic doses are harder than a kick-start on a bulldozer.  I seriously doubt I'll ever try Ayahuasca at all, unless the 'flip' is quicker.  I don't think one can ever get used to that dimension shift feeling.
