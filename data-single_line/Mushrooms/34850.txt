My roommate and I recently tried to trip on an LSA extraction and the effects on my digestive system were less than pleasant.  I heard that mushrooms also do a number on the digestive tract so I tried to take as many precautions as possible to avoid discomfort.  Online reports suggested that a tea infusion often helps with nausea so I decided to try that method instead of simply eating them.  I was talking with a friend over aim and commenting on how it was unfortunate that I had nothing to help settle my stomach.  After I said that, I went into the kitchen, and to my surprise, I see an odd chinese candy sitting on the counter with a picture of a ginger on it.  This was the first minor thing that made me feel comfortable with the idea of tripping.
