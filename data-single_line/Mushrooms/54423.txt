The concept of the Dark Jester, as observed in DMT trips, comes to the fore.  The Trickster shows the absurdity of life, the illusory nature of reality and the importance of laughing about it all  the staving off of absolute madness by disassociating and yet engaging with it all by playing it like a game.  Who knows, perhaps this is the birth of consciousness, the birth of life, of the Universe or just of us as we are.  The important realisation about it all is that that is not our life right now  I am not a protein sequence screaming to become more so to identify with that  is pointless.  The experience was what it was and I can now file it under past experiences (phew) but it was a concept, not a present reality.  At the time within the trip though, that realisation is absent.  A trip sitter might have been helpful but I am not sure at those quantities and that level of oblivion of the mind, any tripsitter would have been able to get through anyway.
