Once home, we put on Yellow Submarine, the most psychedelic movie ever in my opinion. W and I are both die-hard Beatles fans, so we had been looking forward to this for days. We put on the movie, and once again, I don't remember much of the intro, but I vividly remember grinning and laughing at how well-made the 'Sea of Time' part was. It just reminded me of how little time actually matters, and how it's just an illusion we've created along with our so-called 'reality'. Fortunately, I peaked at the same time as the movie. When the Blue Meanies were looking for the fab four with what I knew was a blue, three-headed bulldog, I tried to count its heads, but every time I tried, my entire field of vision turned into a tessellation of bulldog heads. This made me feel a bit uneasy, and for a second I was afraid I was tripping too intensely and was about to get the fear, but I calmed myself down and convinced myself I shouldn't try and fight it. Before I knew it, the peak was over, and I was back at normal level.
