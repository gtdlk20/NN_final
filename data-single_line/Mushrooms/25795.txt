This is when I entered deep meditation and conversed somewhat with the Mushroom.  I say somewhat because no direct words were exchanged, the communication was very subtle.  I felt myself near the mindstate of the Overmind, yet I was hesitant to fully engage myself in it because the environment was not conducive to it (my dog pulling on the leash, my dad mowing the lawn), and I hope to enter the Overmind on my next trip.  Yet I felt the Mushroom entity was in symbiosis with my nervous system, it actually felt as if a mycelium network was integrated into my brain.  I used basic Buddhist meditation techniques with rhythmical tapping on my body to maintain equilibrium.  I felt that what the Mushroom wants is a medium to express its creativity.  I could begin tapping my fingers on my knees and, by freeing myself to the subtle Mushroom frequencies, create complex and sustained rhythms.  These rhythms undoubtedly harnessed psychic energies which were immediately unleashed when I would suddenly stop tapping.  Upon doing so, energy flooded inward to the Self.  This technique of building up energy with rhythm and then unleashing it by sudden stopping I learned from Osho in his Tantric teachings.
