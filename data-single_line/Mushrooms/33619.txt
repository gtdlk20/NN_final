I went back and gazed at the pentagram some more and the same visuals happened and then every so often an emotion would come up and I would focus on it and feel it intensely and the memory to that emotion would come up and I would contemplate and then I would go back to the visual, this happened back and forth through the whole trip.  I got the guidance I wanted although it was mostly mental and emotional but itÂ’s what I needed and it totally fixed my perception of my life and it is now very beautiful.  I hope I can keep this perspective.
