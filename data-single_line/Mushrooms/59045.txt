Coming up and plateau (in the hallway)~ I'm not so sure about the actual order of the following events, but I do remember how I felt quit clearly. I remember going into the exit hallway next to Spencers to smoke a cigarette and this is where it really took off. As I sat on the floor smoking my cigarette I noticed the orange and red burning embers were so much brighter and bolder than usual, but I didnt think too much of it. Then when it came time to put it out, I flicked it at the wall, but as I watched the butt fly through the air and hit the wall, it looked as if a tiny firework had just been lit. After seeing this, Lisa and me looked at each other in amazement, ran over, picked up the still semi-lit cigarette, and flicked it at the wall again. We laughed so hard and we were so amazed at how cool it looked. We continued to flick the cigarette until it was totally 100% out.
