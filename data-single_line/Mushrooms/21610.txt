We both agreed that we were starting to feel a bit odd so we decided to test it out. Dee turned on the recess light on his high ceiling fans to a dim setting. We returned to the couch when I began to concentrate on my hand. I began to see another set of my fingers above my current set of fingers and stared at them in amazement. They werenÂ’t connected to my actual fingers but they were very blurry and floating there just inches above. As soon as I could think to tell Dee, I see from my peripheral vision, him staring at his hand in amazement on the other side of his couch and all of a sudden his thumb appeared to be inches from my face and in line with the rest of my fingers even though he was at least six feet away. I pulled my hand down and we laughed hysterically in excitement and awe.
