When I arrived home I was feeling a distinctly unpleasant body high but was still in near complete possesion of my faculties.  I decided  that I had to take a shower and (for some stupid reason) do my homework.  This pretty much ruined the trip for me so that when I peaked I was trapped in an obsessive, extremely introspective, agitated, and repetitive state.  I desperately wanted to talk to someone and I was feeling very physically ill so I told my sister what I had done and told her to tell my parents if I passed out.  I spent the next several hours trying to do my homework but repeatedly mis-spelled 'recommendation' and for some reason I decided that this meant I had to start the whole thing over.  Also, the entire time I was questioning the merits of my drug use in my head.  There is really nothing like telling yourself you're a DEA statistic over and over again to boost your self esteem.
