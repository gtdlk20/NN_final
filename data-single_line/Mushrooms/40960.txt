Someone close to my wife and me uses mushroom to successfully control depression, and being generally curious, we previously tested tolerance with a light dose, IÂ’m guessing less than a gram, with generally good effects; I had warm feeling with mild behind the eye abstract patterns, and generally sleepy warm feelings, but not much else.  There was some warning in this first experiment in that I have some peripheral neuropathy with tingling and an occasional burning itch in one hand and in my feet, and this seemed to aggravate that a little. Neither of us had used recreational drugs previously, and are non-smokers and non-drinkers.
