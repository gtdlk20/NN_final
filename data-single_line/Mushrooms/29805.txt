Depression? I dont think that psilocybin is a cure for clinical depression, but in my case (minor depression) I know that it was beneficial. It shook my paradigm and reawakened a deeper awareness of the sublime and mystical nature of life. I no longer live life as a Cartesian. It has also (without a doubt) raised my sensitivity toward others; and that is truly a good thing; something that I have sought as a Christian.
