We decided to eat the shrooms, then go on a mission across some fields on a path by the river, a mission we had done before on mushrooms and had a great experience. We divided the mushrooms (about 70 for me, 50 for my mate), ate them fresh, grabbed our skateboards for some reason and set off on our quest.
