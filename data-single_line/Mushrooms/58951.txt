My friends was tripping thinking he has a mass swarm or ants on his head, he said he needed ant killer RAID.  Next thing we knew me and my friend were tripping thinking we were in a nintendo game and our other friend was the devil.  We kept transforming with horns and he had a red shirt on.  We both became scared and told him to remove the red shirt.  He came back and his lil brother came into the room with a Scream mask on and was tripping me out so bad.  We started to rip away and pillows and take out the fluff. It was so soft it felt like a life saver.
