Mixed in with all of this was a feeling of mystical connection with my ancestry and the ancestry of the entire islands history.  I also felt a deep connection with the Tsunami victims and I even thought that I was one.  I then thought that a tsunami was coming and then felt very frightened.  This feeling wasnt helped by the fact that my tent literally lifted up a few feet while I was inside, apparently from the strong wind (or from who knows what??).  The feeling of fear surrounding this situation eventually subsided.
