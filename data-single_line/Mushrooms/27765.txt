All of a sudden I was out of the eucalyptus (my friends had vanished; I didn't see them again until after the trip) and walking through campus, my guitar slung across my chest.  My mind had not slowed down one whit, and began to race forward, endlessly forward into the future.  I saw myself carrying out various interactions with complete strangers, all the while operating with values completely unrelated to all that I (whoever 'I' was) had ever known.  My future self lived countless lives in my head, each furthur disconnected from my sober reality.
