Im sure I could have ended my trip slowly and peacefully but I went for the more violent 'Im going to stop tripping right now' approach.  My headache grew progessively worse and worse and was soon followed by nausea.  I felt like I had a migraine and all the while I wished that the floors would stop moving and the maps would stop flapping.  I couldnt stand the light and we all began arguing about whether the lights should be on or off.  The walls were still breathing, even though I was trying to force them not to.  I did everything within my power to force myself out of the trip but it wouldnt work.  I choked down some ibuprofen and leaned into my chair.  I closed my eyes and saw things I didnt want to be there.  I basically suffered for a half an hour until I began to feel better.  Nick and James went downstairs for dinner but Margo and I stayed in Nicks room.  We engaged in some disjointed conversation, mostly about how cool everything looked and how we were sort of coming down.  The conversation was at least human, and it was comforting to me.  No one had been talking for a while and I was beginning to feel slightly alone.  I stood up, walked around the room, took a closer look at things and realized I was done tripping.  I had had an amazing time.
