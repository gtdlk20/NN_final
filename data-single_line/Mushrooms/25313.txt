T-0:15--We run downstairs to find 'Ally' who was going to smoke a joint with us. We find her and she says she can't. For some reason, the fact she couldn't join us was very funny. Me and Jim looked at each other and walk quickly out of the hotel onto the back grounds near the woods, and crack up. We laugh and laugh for about 10 minutes. I remember shouting '45 minutes my ass!' (in reference to the effects setting in).
