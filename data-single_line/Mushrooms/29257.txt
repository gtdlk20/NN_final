 started to feel very irritated and angry towards A, even though up till now I had only had good feelings about him. The irritation was due to the fact that I felt he wanted something from me which I could not give (since I was in a relationship and didnt want to do anything to endanger that), and also because I felt he didnt understand me, and we were somehow in a different rhythm. I felt he had abandoned me to this weird world, even though he was supposed to be my guide. I think the anger arose of the fact that I felt that he was responsible for my situation and the negative feelings I was having, one of which was insurmountable sadness. At one point of the emotional rollercoaster, I felt I was feeling the sadness of my boyfriend for what I was putting him through (I had told him in an email about the attraction I had for A, and that I wanted some more freedom in our relationship). I dont know whether it really was his sadness or not, but at the moment it felt like the most real thing in the world, that I was feeling his feelings.
