After fully coming down, I start to feel drained. Tripping takes alot out of me, and the need to sleep overtook me. I had a slight headache and my legs and neck hurt a bit. The only parts of tripping mushrooms that I dont like are the paranoia and being so tense. This feeling is much more pronounced with other psychedelics such as LSD, but it is easy to deal with. Even after sleeping several hours I still have the headache, although, all-in-all Im very pleased with my trip.
