Sitting there in the middle of the dirt trail, all of undergoing extreme mental and visual bedlam, with a growing sense of paranoia and panic, as we noticed a helicopter not far overhead.  My friend B says, 'In reality, we are just sitting here, tripping'.  This helps me, and I think it helps them too.  I began to look at the landscape again, and again I see faces, but this time I see them not only in the plantlife, but in everything at once.  The muddy, dry creek bed formed a 30' long frown, two dead bushes formed eyeballs, and a pile of rocks formed a nose.  I began to dwell on the question of why this planet was so unhappy that it had a thirty foot long frown, and I began to feel depressed.
