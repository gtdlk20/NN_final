After several days, my counterpart's curiosity grew. She could never really begin to grasp the world that I was about to show her for her early anniversary present. So I picked the most beautiful part of surroundings that I could think of for my love and me. There is a gorgeous forest that is at the west end of town. After finishing my morning chores around the house, I told M she could go ahead and eat her half of the eighth and we set out for the forest.
