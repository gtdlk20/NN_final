I realize my experience isn't thrilling to read, but my point is: When experimenting with psychedelics it is important to err on the side of caution. Many times I was disappointed for not having experienced a stronger trip but I didn't lose anything. I still enjoyed myself, gained experience and ended the event with a safe, more knowledgeable outlook. There can always be another chance to trip if you are having doubts about the dosage!
