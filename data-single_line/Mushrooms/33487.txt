The day we decided to do this I went out for breakfast feeling very nervous and anxious to have a repeat of last time's bad trip. Upon returning to the house I made a nice playlist on my laptop with happy, relaxing music. We went to the kitchen and drank the mushroom tea we had prepared, frozen, and thawed out 2 days prior. I drank a full mug of tea, it tasted ok, albeit a bit swampy. I also ate about half a spoonful of the 'mush', and gave the rest to my SO, because I was very nervous and wanted to have a controlled trip.
