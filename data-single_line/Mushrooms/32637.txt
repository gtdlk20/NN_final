God Encounter - God then told me in this state that I was truly dead in real life.  He had told me that I had jumped through a window while on shrooms and my parents and the ambulance declared me dead on the spot.  He told me that I did this when I thought that Quetzalcoatl picked me up and dropped me.  He told me that I was a God in my own right, that I would be free to gather the cosmos, but instead I hated this bit because this would mean that I would see no one in my family or my friends the rest of my existence as a spirit.
