B started yelling curses even louder and soon everyone else in the room joined in except E who had taken up the drink again. Everyone was mad at M(except E) and everyone talked of beating the shit out of him the moment he returned. I was sketching like mad. I grabbed my headphones and tried to look out the window for some clarity but was interuppted by M's arrival. He stumbled in the room and everyone went fucking insane. They started to yell and scream and so did I but not in english or in any known language so I am told.
