After the punching incident, my friends decided that I needed to lie down and chill out. S and W went downstairs to smoke a joint, while A helped me into bed and sat with me. She sat andf stroked my head while I tried to explain all that was going on in my head. I felt an intense affinity with A, and I felt incredibly connected to her, as though we were the only two people in the world and we were brought together at this place by fate. After the trip A and I started dating, but we only lasted a few months.
