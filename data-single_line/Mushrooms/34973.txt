I had written and drawn all over a little notebook now, there were a lot of mushrooms drawn and written were some crazy theories and some very obvious things that had just hit me in a genuine way they had never written before.  The way the stuff was written it had looked like a schizophrenic had to be responsible for it.  One passage taking up a whole page read 'The key is to getting is not to want, but to have.  You'll get everything - happiness, peace of mind, unity with man and nature, if you can just have everything you have now, and be content.'  Another was little poem that read 'And, we only have each other.  And, every man is your brother.  And.'  Not sure what the point of throwing the word 'And' in there, this was not a continuation of another writing.
