I'll give a small timeline. As I was alone and I wanted some security, I penned down at what time I took them and did a written follow up every hour or so. This is a good thing to do if you're taking psychedelics on your own. It enables me to supervise the working of the drug on my mind. Shrooms do their thing and I know it. Hours are on a 24H-scale.
