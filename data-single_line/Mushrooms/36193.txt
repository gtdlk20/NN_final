Back downstairs, and now things begin to get very silly indeed. I slipped into a trance state where I seemed to be reliving most of my childhood. Although I'm not totally clear on this, I remember being able to switch between just about every memory I had of my childhood, and I saw that they were all connected. At the time this was all very profound, and I felt that I was releasing more repressed memories. Probably around an hour later I snapped out of it and by this time I was feeling *perfect*! I was heavenly. I felt as if a big weight had been lifted off my shoulders and I was pure again. I was using an untainted mind, relieved of every hurt and anguish I had ever received.
