In background, I am a college student, and I have only been experimenting with drugs for a year and a half. I have done mushrooms in specific once before, and it was not a pleasant experience. That time was the same dosage as this one. It was in my own house and generally ended up as a negative psychological trip in which I was convinced I was a terrible person, terrified, and I wanted to die.
