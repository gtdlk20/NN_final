This went on for an indiscernible amount of time.  At some point I stopped dancing, and looked up.  The sky was no longer pitch black, but a grayish hue of blue.  The sun was coming up.  I looked back down, and everything had changed.  I could see beyond the tiny black-light enclosed area where everyone was dancing, and out into the surrounding forested areas... an endless landscape of bare trees.  Perceptually it felt like the entire world had transformed from darkness to light in a single moment.  I rotated my body and took all 360 degrees of my surroundings in.  This was profound.  From here on as the sun came up the experience became very spiritual.
