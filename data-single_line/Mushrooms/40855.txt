It took me several trips on these mushrooms increasing the dosage to realize they just were a shitty batch. Initially I started with 1g and worked my way up to 6g over a large time frame. Initially I started with 1g and worked my way up to 6g over a large time frame. I took them on many occasions ie. at an International Flower Show, While working in my Gardens, at a Large Multi-room Electronic Music party, several days spent alone at home, on Road trips and many more without feeling much more than some casual philosophical thoughts, mild brightening of colors and a slightly altered feeling. This is with as much as 6 grams as well. I would consider most of these trips a 1/10. (0 being not tripping at all, 1o being TRPNBALZ)
