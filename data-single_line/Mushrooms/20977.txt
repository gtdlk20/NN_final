Years later, I was birthing a baby. Birthing hormones changed my sense of time. Only one moment at a time was accessible, and that was great, because it meant that the baby would be born the next moment.   I was doing well until the midwife, not understanding psychedelic time, made a reference to me potentially being in labour for hours to come. To me, that meant literally forever. Desperately, I reached into my own awareness to connect with that one who always said yes, who would choose suffering over numbness ... and it said no. To feel scared, abandoned and in pain forever was not acceptable on any level. I did not want to play the universe game. I was seriously traumatized afterwards, despite having a mostly natural birth.
