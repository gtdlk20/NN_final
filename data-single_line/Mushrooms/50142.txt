I must have eventually fallen asleep and was awoken at about 5:30 by my friends who were leaving. I was still tripping at this point and I felt the need to go outside. After my friends left I had a walk up to the local playing field where some of my other friends were playing football. The whole world was distorted and everything still had the green/red aura around it.
