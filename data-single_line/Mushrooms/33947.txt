Now convinced and proved to that the mushroom is a key to the Divine knowledge (something I knew intuitively already) and that even some of the most corrupted of religions, such as Christianity, falls back on a legacy of keeping this information a secret, we began our sacrament in a more sacred fashion than simple ingesting. We decided to enchant the Mushrooms with a short prayer and a moment of silence. I conducted the prayer that went something like, Lets thank the Divine for letting us partake on this journey with the Mushroom. Please, guard our spirits from negative and evil powers and let us journey safely outside the limits of everyday perception. The mushrooms were ground and mixed with sesame and honey as Merc had prepared them about 2 months ago, and were sitting in the fridge for the time. We all thought it would have been better to just eat the Mushrooms plain, as the mass was too sweet from too much honey. Nevertheless, we all ate 3 to 3.5 grams each.
