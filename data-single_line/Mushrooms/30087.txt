In turn, I (Ouranoboros) suggested a way to frame the experience as a Holy Sacrament by consecrating Logos into a line of wandering, Gnostic Bishops.  The special calling of this tradition is to roam beyond the constraints of visible hierarchy through all apparent differences, transforming the profane into the sacred in the name of Love:  As a newly ordained Bishop, Logos would be empowered by the tradition to elevate ordinary sustenance into the Divine and Healing Body of God as  a Eucharist, whose nourishing absorption would become a means of reunion with the loving heart of the Universe itself...This would of course be performed upon the Mushrooms.
