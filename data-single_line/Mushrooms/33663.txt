Both T and I experienced the same signal for the beginning of the trip, first my, then T's vision did a sudden and dramatic red shift. There was nothing threatening or amazing about it, but it was a playfully wonderful hint at the revelations soon to come. As the effects started to build we decided to go up into the forest to start. Walking up the wooden steps took an exceptionally long time as P had begun to feel them and was drooping all over me and hindering my steps, but eventually we got into deep woods. By this time visibility was almost null, and as such my visuals were taking form as intense overlay, but no actual distortion. Me and T tried to organize our thoughts like we had the night before on mescaline, but quickly realized that though our thoughts felt profound they were very singular and un-string-able.
