T suddenly looked over at me and proclaimed 'YOU ARE A CAT!!' For some reason, this upset me and I denied it for a good half hour. I finally accepted it and got up out of the bathtub which I had fallen into while denying that I was a cat. I looked at T and shadow and color became one on his face. This new substance started to drip down the bridge of his nose and engulf his face. His face was suddenly painted like some stereotypical tribal villager of some lost jungle. He suddenly gained another piercing in his nose, and his mohawk turned into a river of fire.
