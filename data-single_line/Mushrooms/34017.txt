At the Chipotle we stopped at, Ace and I used the bathroom (after being convinced that he was, in fact, a man and should go in the door marked MEN) and I just stood in there staring at myself in the mirror and the strange shapes my face was taking. I'm not sure how long we were in there, but both Ace and I had to be coaxed out by our 'babysitters'. We proceeded to the hookah bar and Ace kept trying to convince everyone in the car that it's okay to feel the way he was feeling because 'IT'S THE WEEKEND!!' I remember looking out the car window and all I could think was 'I am so glad I am not driving because I don't even know where we are in my own town'. I knew I had driven on these roads before myself, but could not comprehend anything around me.
