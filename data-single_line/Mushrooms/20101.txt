I went back inside.  As I was walking down a hallway, it suddenly shifted and started to rock, and the lights began to shimmer and fade.  All of a sudden I understood.  I was supposed to just sit back and go with the flow.  Dont try to analyze it or control it, just experience it for what it is.  Everything rapidly became very interesting - the textures, the colors, the meanings behind words.  Lights and sounds were more detailed and required more of my thoughts to analyze.  There was a 20-foot tall animatronic T-rex with full sound and movement that was eating the carcass of a triceratops.  It was the most realistic robot I have ever seen.  I just stood in front of it and stared at it without moving for what seemed like 15 minutes.  I was the only person in that main room of the museum.  I had what Civil War re-enactors would call a period rush.  For just a few seconds, I felt like I was really there.  Like I was in prehistoric earth in front of a T-rex, and it about scared the shit out of me.
