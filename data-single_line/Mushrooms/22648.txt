Knowledge is divided into two parts, that of which is true of the planet and that of knowledge spanning from what is created by Humans. The quest for knowledge is futile to say the least because the knowledge we know is highly subject to humans base of understanding and imagination. Religion is Mans greatest projection to make it easier for him to cope by making others simply believe what he does. This is the order man must create in complete chaos. He must do this to convince others, deceive them, promote his agenda and values, and find a common ground to explain that of which cannot be comprehended. This is in essence, our grip of time, language, and history: it is all materialistic in nature because it is comprehended and created by a mortal. For instance, It is deemed as knowledge of Biblical references, but in comparison to knowing some crazy mans made up story one has not gained any knowledge whatsoever by any standard. That is what is at stake, pairing the major world religions to merely facets of imagination.
