The guy let me use his drum while he went to take care of something and I felt like I was a little kid receiving the most precious Christmas present in the history of man. I smiled with intensity and said, 'Hell yea!' I got into the assembly of drums. He sat around for like 10 minutes and nodded with impressment at how good I was, but Im telling you now, I am pretty good, but still a beginner when Im sober, but when Im on mushrooms, I am literally compared to the best there. I don't know how it worked, but my creativity was just so enhanced. I had a blast, changing my drum rift every 5 minutes or so. By now, I had been about 3 hours away from initial dose.
