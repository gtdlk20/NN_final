I went with a good friend of mine who is also my roommate into the mountains to embark on a tripping experience on a warm Saturday morning where dew still clung to the pine needles and there was a general amiable nature about the beginnings of the day in general. We had planned to share an eigth in light of their quality and our inexperience. We climbed up a little bluff overlooking the path at which point we ate the shrooms plain and washed it down with a cracker or two and a swig of cool water. We then began to apprehensivly await the trip to come.
