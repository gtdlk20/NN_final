I was extremely weak leaving the venue and could barely hold my head off my chest.  I requested to my friend that I sit down against a fence and rest.  I sensed that the worst of my confusion was over; I felt as if I had been sucked into the epicenter and had been spit out the other side.  I slowly backed away from the source of the swirling confusion, and my mental facilities strengthened at about the same rate as I had earlier lost them.  After roughly 30 minutes leaning against the fence, my friend picked me off the ground and led me back to my seat.
