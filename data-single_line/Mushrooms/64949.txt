After a few minutes I became slightly more relaxed and my vision became a little blurred.  After 10 minutes of just sitting around (feeling like I just smoked some pot), I got up and engaged myself in repairing my truck.  After I stopped thinking about the 2 grams I smoked my mind was completely clear again (25 minutes) and I was left only with motivation.
