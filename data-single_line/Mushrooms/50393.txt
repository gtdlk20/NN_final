Looking back on the experience, that wasn't the smartest thing to do. With mushrooms it is often better to just let things go and let the trip come over you, instead of trying to concentrate on some task or action. Soon  the trip got more and more powerful and i started to feel overwhelmd with irrational fears. My mind was going too fast, jumping from thought to thought. I kept trying to preform certain actions in a manic way, unable to finish anything because of the power of the trip. I soon stormed downstairs, mumbling words mixed with songs and looking for something that could end this strange maelstrom of thoughts. I soon lost every contact with reality. I couldn't remember what or who I and my enviroment was. All the information was stil in my head but scrambled, out of context. I could barely remember that my current state had something to do with schrooming. The only clear emotion was a primal fear that I would never get out of this. Thank God nobody else was present because I must have looked pretty scary.
