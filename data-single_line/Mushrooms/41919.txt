I imagined getting lost and freezing in the woods. I reached the absolute brink of panic, almost crouching down in hopeless despair, but I snapped out of it, realised this kind of struggle is exactly what I was after when I planned the trip. Something unexpected but manageable. I took a deep breath and looked around me. In the darkness I saw cars driving down a distant road, and knew it was the road to my town. I knew I only had to follow that road, but it didnt have a path so Id have to stay in the woods. I was still pretty freaked out and was having dark imagery of parasitic aliens using peoples psychic energy by essentially programming new neural networks in their brains and getting them to run operations for them. This culminated in an image of someones brain so riddled with parasitic neurons that their head and skull splits open down the middle and their brain bursts out like a really ripe fruit. I take one look at google maps and make sure Im headed the right way down the road. As soon as I confirm I am, my phone dies. I took this as the final sign of my test and continued, still a little rattled.
