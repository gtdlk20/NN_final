(T+1:30) I close my eyes and my mind begins to extend it's existence.  My thoughts leave my body and become vapors in the air, floating through time and memories.  The colors in my eyes became so complex that they told a story in themselves.  A purple-cloaked wizard stands on a cliff (a lot like the cover of Led Zeppelin IV but smoother and violet).  Vortexes and spirals are born from one another morphing and melting to bring about new forms, IÂ’m lost in the world of my mind.
