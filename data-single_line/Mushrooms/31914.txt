Finally, our friend arrived. We quickly stumbled in his house and sat right down on the couch. He was slightly rude and was acting differently toward both of us. I sensed something was up, but I didn't quite know what. The moment he closed the front door I felt a sense of uneasiness and fear. My mood dropped significantly. A few minutes later his friend shows up and joins us. He smiled and greeted me, and was one individual whom I did not appreciate the company of. My friend who I had been tripping with lay back onto his couch. I felt our positive mood diminish at an astounding rate. Everything suddenly became dull, wrong and frightening. I felt incredibly uncomfortable and unsafe. I wrapped myself up in a blanket and put in my headphones and closed my eyes. I felt myself fall down a deep pit- patterns and colours overlaying my vision as I fell deeper and deeper. The music sounded deep and rich. I tried playing uplifting tunes but to my dismay they did not improve my mood or the experience. It felt like an artificial coverup and a bad attempt of hiding how I was feeling. This worsened my mood and I urged my friend to leave with me and walk to the nearby park, but she snuggled up on the couch and refused.
