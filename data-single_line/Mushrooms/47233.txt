Finally I realized that it was time for dinner so walked down the beach amid a series of dancing stars and flashes. At this point I had become used to the concept that I was going to be seeing some very strange things tonight and none of this phased me. Upon arrival at my car I discovered that it had miraculously turned purple (it is usually a hideous brown) and like every other car appeared to be glowing. As dinner cooked I was able to have a fairly intelligent conversation with my fellow campers (all stuck on earth) and became aware that the visual effects were wearing off.  It had been 4 hours since I ingested the chocolates. Gone were the vivid hallucinations, replaced with the odd effect that everything was surrounded by a halo of light.
