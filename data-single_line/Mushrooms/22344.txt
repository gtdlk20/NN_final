Eventually I lost this ability to control the experience and instead I found myself experiencing a death of myself or my ego. The present reality would fade, and I would fall into a world within my mind of fleeting symbolism and powerful emotions; then one by one my attachments to who I am, where Ive been, what my world iswould cease to be my own. I would suddenly fall back into a bizarre reality in which nothing was familiar yet this distance was not frightening. Instead this disassociation was as though I could look at the world with the fresh eyes of an infant. Nothing held its previously attached meanings or habits. The very act moving my jaw, taking a step, interacting with people and manipulating my environment was fascinating. I was imbued with heightened sensitivity to my own biological processes and the multitude of steps that make it possible to reach for a glass of water and a take a sip. I was free of my previously held habits, schemas, and prejudices. Then I would fall away and once again be born into this alien world that was not my own.
