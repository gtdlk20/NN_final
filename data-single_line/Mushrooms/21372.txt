T+30 minutes: Lying in bed quietly with eyes closed I wanted to watch closely how it unfolded. The waves rose slowly and the rainbow pastel colors started to separate and replicate, and I tried to watch the center. The familiar disorientation and self-doubt rose up - not so much 'are you sure this is a good idea' which I used to get, more along the lines of 'what makes you think you can have a peak experience?' All this 'I'm not worthy' bullshit. I let go and let go, and watched. The center of 'me' became thinner and thinner until I was transparent. I needed music.
