I realized how good it was to do mushrooms with a group of people, lately all the trips I've gone on have only been with one other person. It felt better this way, like the circle was complete. I noticed a peculiar phenomenon while we sat there in the dim lighting, I noticed that I could see my fellow trippers very clearly, but the two people who weren't on mushrooms sort of faded into the shadows. We finished the bowl and went upstairs we tripped out for awhile and decided to go to my house. We went upstairs and slowly got our things together and got ready to go. Once we left, at about 2:00 am,we went down to the riverbank right by Betty and Veronica's house and started on the path towards my house. We talked about mushrooms and told stories as we walked. We talked about my first mushroom trip, which both Kancer and Betty participated in as well. It was good thinking about things like that. We soon came to a place where the paved path went one way and a dirt path started. We decided to follow Robert Frost's advice and take the road less traveled. As we made our way along the path it started to go down into a sort of ravine, the ground was muddy and it was slow going, but we got to the bottom and found a small stream that ran into the river. We crossed it and climbed up the other side. We continued on for awhile, in silence. I felt a cool breeze on my face and breathed in the fresh night air, and I felt extremely peaceful.
