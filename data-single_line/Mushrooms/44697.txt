Sure, I knew the words, but they wouldn't transform into sentences, they didn't make any sense, and I then realised I was laughing hysterically. I felt a beginning of euphoria in my body, and at the same time, it felt like there was water leaking inside of my leg. Like I was a big boat, and there was water leaking in - it felt very pleasant.
