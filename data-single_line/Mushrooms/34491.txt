I weighed out 14 grams of dried mushrooms and made a shake with ice cream, fruit and mushrooms in the blender. The shake covered up the taste a bit, but not a lot. I was able to suck the shake down in about 5 minutes though. I sat back and continued to watch TV almost forgetting that I had consumed so many mushrooms. After about a half hour, I suddenly realized that I was sitting in a large mall at a desk in a corridor that was sloping down into a lower entrance to the mall. Thats when I knew the mushrooms were kicking in. I (probably out loud) said, Wow.
