The effects were very noticeable then. We decided to walk down a path further down the beach. I could still interact with people by then but we were definitely starting to act weird. There was this huge Ferris wheel with tons of neon lights that would go in all sorts of patterns that was starting to become very intense. Reality was very altered by that time and we were still coming up. Tracers were starting to appear and the lights from the Ferris wheel seemed to radiate energy that I could feel in my mind. I started having so many different feelings. I could not tell if I had to go to the bathroom or eat or if I was cold, kind of a little of everything.
