Suddenly I spoke to mom, and said, How much longerits sohard, my voice broke from the emotion. Soon, she promised. Sohard, I repeated. This reminded me of Jesus not wanting to drink this bitter cup. Then the scenario of the hospital was gone, I was Me Lying in the Bed. As I looked at the wall to my right next to my head, where mom was, I saw a glow. I saw a small delicate ball of light the size of a soccer ball with no distinct edges. It was the only visual I experienced as Me Lying on the Bed. It pulsed with its Love and I felt it emanate through me, I gasped. MomI never knew. I began to cry harder, if that was possible. I never knew you loved me so much After this scenario, begins the dialogue with The Inner Me.
