I remember thinking of my mind as a mushroom, and seeing tons and tons of little mushrooms bubbling in my mind, and I could hear their bubbling and feel it in some weird way. Then I was aware of a giant mushroom as being my central focus point of my mind, and two-sides of rushing, bubbling mushrooms moving in circles, one side on the right and one on the left. This was the a pleasant sensation and I focused on it for a while. I was experiencing many emotions, though, and it was hard to focus on anything for more than a few seconds. It was somewhat frustrating, but I always had the music to go back to. The drums were exploding and I couldn't understand the singing, but it was comforting compared to the new feelings I had of being mentally pulled in different directions nearly simultaneously. P always seemed to be either staring off, or would set off some automatic laughter inside me by simply moving a certain way. He responded pretty much the same to anything I did. I was surprised how unexhausting it was though, and how energized I felt.
