I then seemed to hit a peak with the energy, it seemed to stabilize itself to a sustained level.  Then visualizations started. I was somehow in control over my visualizations, but saw them from a completely different perspective.  I had visualizations that almost defy description.  They were crystal clear, I couldnÂ’t have seen them clearer if I had seen them with my eyes.  I could 'ask' a question and get a visual answer, or ask for a visual and get the visual telepathically transcended across time and space to me.  By 'ask,' I mean to think the question.  Somehow an answer would get 'thinked' back to me.  This 'thinking' and 'asking' defy language as we know it.  It seemed that I was communicating with something, something not from this world.  Communicating with thought, not with words.
