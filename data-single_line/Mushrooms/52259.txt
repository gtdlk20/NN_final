We all sat down and started smoking; each of us had a variety of strong weeds.  We had brought a couple of tutes with us from home, and I sat there building myself one after another with Skunk and Northern Lights.  For those of you who donÂ’t know (mostly Americans, I would expect) a tute is basically a pipe stuck in a plastic bottle.  It looks like a bong without the cone.  It works similar to a bong, but is much better cause you get much more of a hit off it.
