After playing for about an hour we just sat around talking about how we felt and about the world.  It felt like everything we said was really deep and thoughtful.  Some things actually were and some things were pointless.  Z and I have been best friends for about 9 years and we were agreeing about everything and we understood eachother on every subject.
