I suppose I am a relatively inexperienced psychonaut, but no one can read minds or memories, so theres no way to ever know for sure whether this experience was the most extreme type or not, nor is there really any way to measure such qualities. I believe the possibilities are limitless, and extreme trips are incomparable. But this was the most extreme I have ever experienced, and, while I might be surprised next time, I dont think I could conceive of a more intense dismantling of reality on this particular drug. It may require trying acid or DMT to find anything more startling, or maybe not. Either way, I am firmly against doing anything in excess, so I dont think I could benefit at all from trying a higher dose of mushrooms. Ive taken between an eighth and half-eighth every time, and Ive never had a bad trip. I dont see the point of every changing the effective dose. I certainly feel very fortunate to be blessed with such an amazing chemistry as to be compatible in such a way with a drug that will cause so much joy.
