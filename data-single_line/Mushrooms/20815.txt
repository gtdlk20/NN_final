I began to hear sounds coming from my wall between the closet and my bed. It sounded like either old hot-water pipes heating up for use, or metallic clanging reminiscent of knocking. Like my experience with LSD, I begin to question my senses. Does my apartment even have old hot-water pipes? I highly doubt it. Has this sound ever been noticed before? Not to my knowledge, and its my bedroom Perhaps the elves have come a knocking as Mr. McKenna says.
