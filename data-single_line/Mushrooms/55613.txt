We head back into the dorms and decide to sit in our kitchen, which has a beautiful view of the entire campus thanks to huge floor to ceiling window and a couch right in front of it.  I am still tripping nicely and my roommate starts to experience the beauty of mushrooms, probably assisted by the MJ.  We sit and look at the scenery melt and transform for the next 3 hours, never leaving that couch for anything.  I notice the clouds seem to take the form of huge faces that are trying to swoop down and swallow me right from off that couch.  I am overwhelmed by this sensation and close my eyes for a few seconds.  It is at this time that I discover some amazing CEVs.  The most intricate of patterns could instantly be displayed on the back of my eyelids.  The most interesting thing that occurred at this time was when it felt like the entire campus was just an extension of my body, and all the people within it were merely 'cells' traveling to my different organs.  We continue to sit in front of that window until we notice a slight come down.
