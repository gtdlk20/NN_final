Night had come and the roads (actually footpaths about 20 feet wide completely structured with straw) were packed full of wandering adults, lost deadheads, drug dealers, hippies walking down the rows swinging basketfuls of every ganja treat you've ever heard of, screaming, 'ganja brownies! 3 for 10!' While the ganja was openly expressed in yells and screams and signs and advertising and samples, the mushrooms were a little different. IÂ’d be was along and a random individual out of the crowd kinda leaned my way as he's walking by and whispered, 'mushies...' and then he kept walking.
