I don't know where I went during this trip, but my mind was definitely looking back on me from another plane of existence.  I also don't know who, or what, was in control of my arms and legs the entire time, but I'd like to figure it out, and perhaps I will in time.  I keep thinking it was some local creature from the reality I was coexisting in, doing the same thing I was doing: exploring a new dimensional plane, but I can't be certain.  Perhaps as I continue 2+ gram dosages I will able to verify who this was.
