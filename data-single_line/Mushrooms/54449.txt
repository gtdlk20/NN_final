Hitting the cold, hard floor of existential realisation why Terence McKenna stopped taking mushrooms- call it his meat locker experience.  He wouldnt talk about it to anybody and moved his attention from psychedelics to Alchemy and the I-Ching.  Magical thinking is the perfect antidote to these experiences and they are definitely also the lesson to be learned.  Logical deduction alone brings one to ones absolute knees because we are integrated creatures living on problem solving and on daydreaming equally.  Embracing the Mystery is living in ones true, fulfilled potential.
