I first tried mushrooms at the urging of a friend who was very experienced in psychadelics. He encouraged me to eat them, in spite of the fears I had, and promised that he would take care of me and not allow me to feel uncomfortable with anything I was saying or doing. After a beautiful and lifechanging first trip with him, and an unbreakable bond because of it, I decided I was ready to take it a little further. The first time I tripped, I remained completely aware of everything that was happening and when I realized I could make the ceiling ripple in any direction I wanted, I just thought 'That's interesting.'
