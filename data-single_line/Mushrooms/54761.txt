I return to the Aztek ritual.  We are on a megalithic structure.  There are thousands of people dancing, chanting, burning fires.  I join them.  Much time passes.  The ritual fades slowly away back to a euphoric feeling. The mushrooms grow from my stomach, wrapping me in strands of their loving mycelium. The mycelium growing from me extends outward, colonizing the world. I feel connected to everything.  I feel I have access to all the knowledge of the world.
