I recently got the idea to take a vacation to Peru to try Ayahuasca, something I first read about in, 'The Serpent and the Rainbow'.  I read that book the year I graduated high school in 1989, the same year I first tried LSD.  Aya scared the shit out of me, as it is basically long-lasting DMT.  So here I sat all these years later, researching it.  I am still very hesitant to try it and I found out that a 'heroic' or 'shamanic' does of Mushrooms is supposed to possibly cause this same kind of 'flip', from this body/world, into the next.
