Peter and I both agreed that this test run had been the perfect way to remove any fear or anxiety we were feeling the first time, which would prove to benefit us during the full-blown trip. As with any new substance, its only common sense to start with a low dose and work your way up. Of course, its impossible to try and predict how any trip would go anyways. After discussing it further, we both agreed wed like to try it again, and that we would try to obtain more of the drug for the full experience the following week, if we werent busy.
