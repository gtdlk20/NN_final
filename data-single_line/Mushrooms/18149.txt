Seths sticklike figure scampered easily up the first part of the cliff face with no real difficulty, making it to the first plateau. Matt, too, was a good climber, and I followed his quick pace up the cliff, not really thinking about what I was doing.  It wasnt until I came to a nearly vertical part of the climb that I managed to realize what the hell I was doing and exactly how high up I was.  I was shaken but continued to climb until a large chunk of rock came off in one of my hands.  This scared me incredibly, and I realized that the rock I was climbing was not stable, was damn far from it in fact.
