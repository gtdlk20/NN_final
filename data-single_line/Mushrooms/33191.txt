Thoughts of Saddam Hussein (who was finally recently executed) came to mind, in the sense that I had recently been reflecting on the way he sees himself and the way the executioners see him (as fit for hell). Jesus Christ (as a comparison to Hussein) came to mind somewhere insignificantly. My brain seemed to be making some kind of connections with these paradoxes of human good and evil. Nothing clear though!
