It started when me and a friend of mine named Matt went to pick up some psilocybe mushrooms.We went to talk to the person who was getting them for us.So we met at a friend's house.We gave her the money and she went to pick them up from out of state.So why she was doing that we sat around and smoked cannabis.Two hour passed before she showed up.She walked up to me and Matt and said 'Take these smelly things'.So we took the half ounce and left.We got back to my house where a couple of friends waited for us to return.We got inside where we separated the mushrooms.Matt got an 8th,I got the rest.Two seconds later Matt had already eaten his.I gave an 16th of an ounce to my friend Edd and ate a 4th of a ounce through out the night.Suddenly I noticed the posters on my wall looked like it was shaking.Then Matt bursted out laughing uncontrollably.He was laughing so hard he bumped his head againsthis knee.
