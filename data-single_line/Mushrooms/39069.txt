This was the most astonishing, demystifying experience since I learned to speak, or since I lost my virginity.  It was truly amazing and real, I scribbled frantically to write what I could.  The mushroom experience took me to a place of pure knowledge.  It was reality, pure thought and energy.  It was what was, what is and whatever will be: Pure universe.  I give it ***** five stars!  I felt awakened and just so good!
