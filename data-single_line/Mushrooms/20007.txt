My friend was sending me links of trippy artwork, which mutated, shimmered, melted, and grew violently. The images would seem to grow a few inches out in all directions, only to slowly be drawn back in. This pattern went on and on as I started at the pictures, everytime more intense. Around this point,I felt growing anxiety within me, and the very fact that I was anxious served to frighten me even more. I was going up ridiculously fast, and in my state of heightened imagination I fancied that my rapidly loosening grip on reality took on visual form. I pictured myself as a small child lost in space, flying deeper and deeper into the regions of the nether. While viewing a particularly trippy picture, I was amazed at how realistic my pronounced hallucinations had become. I could see the sun rising and then setting, rising and then setting in the background of this picture, and every single component seemed to be a breathing, living mass of cosmic sludge. Suddenly and without warning, my hallucinations ceased to be limited to the words and pictures on my screen, and I found myself staring at a beautiful golden sun comprised entirely of geometric figures that appeared to be etched in to the very background of my screen.
