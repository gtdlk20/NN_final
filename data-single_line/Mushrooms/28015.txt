After a few hours of being absolutely immobilized we made a few furtive attempts at getting down to the beach, but sort of just ended up moving a few things around and wandering away and back to the blanket a few times. We ended up falling all over each other. At one point he had me curled up in his arms and said something like that he had all of me; I felt very small and delicate and safe, and thought that he felt very strong and protective. Snuggling turned into touching and eventually sex. At one point, he actually said the exact words I wrote in a letter to him that I never sent - I just want all of you. I felt like I was going to come just from him putting his finger on my G-spot, not even moving. I didnt feel guilty or like I was bad at sex, I felt like he genuinely enjoys enjoying me. We made love on the forest floor in a beam of sunlight, and he laid me down and looked at me and said my name and told me I was beautiful. I felt like a goddess.
