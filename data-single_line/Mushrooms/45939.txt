I'm in good health, drink once or twice a week (beer or glass of wine after work, which is 9-5 Mon-Fri) and never get slaughtered on alcohol. I'm a regular (every 2-3 months) user of MDMA, no regular user of anything else, I enjoy benzos for comedowns and I rarely use any other drugs - I've tried the standard psychedelics over the last few years of my life though, also cocaine, DMT and a few others not worth noting down. I haven't used anything for about a month prior to this experience though.
