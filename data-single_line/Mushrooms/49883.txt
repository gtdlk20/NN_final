It was now 830 and a calm mood had taken over the room, at this point I was just hanging out at my computer in my room listening to Dark Side of the Moon by who else? Floyd, (they would after this experiance be the band of choice for the rest of the night). I called S back and told him I was going to go enjoy the mild stoned effect that was induced on my mind right now, he had tripped before so he knew what I was going through and suggested I listen to the wall and just chill out for a while. I hung up and went to the computer to turn on my downloaded version of the 2 disked 'the wall'. At about 845 I noticed the background of my computer (an acid blotter of tim leary's profile made out of musical notes) had started to pulsate, not so much just constant pulses but more of a breathing motion. I then noticed that the musical notes began to meld in to one and followed the rythmic pattern of the wall. I decided this was the begining and strapped in for a ride of my life. I got up for another glass of O.J. and as I did looked at a closet door of mine and noticed it was also breathing.
