So I put on a mix tape of some drill n bass and some psy trance and laid down in my bed with the light on, because I couldnÂ’t see a thing with them turned off. I was in bed contemplating my life, my love for family, my love for friends, my reliability, compassion for others, my positions, my options in life, everything. Although I must admit, my thoughts were quite erratic and very difficult to hold onto, this is where I find LSD or even mescaline a far better spiritual tool.
