Once I sat down my friend said something in an inaudible volume, and I replied with a solid 'Speak up lad, I can't quite understand your dialect'. I had meant to say 'Speak louder', but I was far beyond reason now. He replied in something resembling gibberish, which could very well have been a middle eastern language, but I was not familiar with it and once again asked him to repeat it in some odd fashion. Finally he mumbled 'Where were you man? I mean, to dissappear like that would be magic'. It took me a while to catch his meaning, and after a little thinking I said 'I was in the john. It was nice'. Then my companion smiled and layed back into the couch. I noticed the movie was still on, and the screen showed some crazy ensemble of crocodiles and another animal which I couldn't quite place a name on (I now know it was a hippo). I watched in utter facination for the next half hour.
