Without using words I was shown the incredible and vast artefacts of ancient civilisations, used to create this incredible object which is as much Mind as it is a database and a system for broadcasting the existence of a dimensional 'highway'.  A call to space exploration if there had never been any before it. The scale of the endeavour seemed so daunting that I remember repeating to myself over and over and over: bring back something.  Bring back something that I can tell or show or communicate in some strange way.
