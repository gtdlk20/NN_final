I passed out soon afterwards.  Actually, I am not sure 'passed out' is the best way to put it.  It was as if I was instantly severed from any sort of external perception my body or self.  There was only a vast void.  I had no feeling except for a profound contentment. I came back to myself just as the last CD in the changer came to an end.  I opened my eyes.  Everything around me was strange and vaguely menacing.  The light in the room had changed.  It no longer looked like light.  It seemed to just be various shades of yellow painted on the walls, ceiling and furniture.  Shadows listed gently on the walls.  I sat up as I noticed that the shadows seemed to be walking off the walls out into the room.
