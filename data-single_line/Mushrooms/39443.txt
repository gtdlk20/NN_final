I tried to talk, but the trip just got stronger and I could hardly speak a word. Actually I remember now I ate another stem in the middle of it, why I don't know. I knew no one knew what I felt which was an annoying feeling. I started to get very uncomfortable. Thoughts raced through my mind more than I could ever believe. I thought I knew everything. Those people didn't know anything they were all the same. Only I knew, but if I told anyone they'd think I'm nuts and not believe me. It was sort of scary. I felt extreme guilt and just about every other emotion there is at one time. Like I was a bad person. I just felt I would never come back to reality again. I didn't care about anything. I really just wanted the thoughts in my head to go away so I can enjoy the music. The number or questions that arose on me was incomprehensible. What was this? What is life? WHY ANYTHING? Was the biggest thing.
