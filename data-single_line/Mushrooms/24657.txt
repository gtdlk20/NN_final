I could see the panic, disorientation, and fear in my friend's faces that I felt myself.  I demanded that we get moving, but J began to comment that it was too much, it was all too much, and that he HATED mushrooms, yet he kept doing them.  These comments were not helpful.  I told him to lay on his back and look at the sky, because it was more simple and it was beautiful.  He did this, and it calmed him sufficiently.  We got up and started walking again.
