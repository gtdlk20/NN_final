After walking for nearly an hour or so, torch in hand,still burning- I decide to venture back to the house and warm up- and as it goes on, I seem to get a feeling of very strong anxiety in the depths of my stomach-  (it seemed as if the remaining seven grams was kicking in now-  I dropped to the floor, had to crawl to the toilet and hurl up my once beautiful mushrooms- now swirling around in the toilet, changing vibrant colors rapidly and oozing all over inside the blue water.  Then things began to 'melt' and I began to melt with everything else in the bathroom, untill I was being sucked thru the scorching tile floor.  I was being dragged into the center of the earth, spinning uncontrollably downward like falling thru space, but a lot more colorful to say the least.  Anyway, after having a scary yet wonderful trippy time, I finally got to sleep about 6 hours later, which was nearly morning by that time, woke up at 1 pm feeling great!
