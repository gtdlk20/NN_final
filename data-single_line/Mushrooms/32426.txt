This find was the mother load! I hunted 2 more times over the next few days and dried them all out with a blow heater the result was a Tupperware container about the size of an extra large bulk pack tissue box packed full and tight and pressed down with crispy crunchy dried cubensis by far more than I had ever seen in my life.
