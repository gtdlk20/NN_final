As the night wore on, chaotic things began happening. We went to a drum circle hosted by a bunch of Trustafarian surfers a little further down the beach. The vibe was fake and I could feel it. They weren't in our mushroom world and they had no natural rhythm. My visual colors changed from happy bright reds and oranges with swirling tie dye patterns to sad dark blue and grey melting. I felt feelings of power and strength to get away. They didn't want us to leave, and it felt good to be wanted, but the mushrooms lead us away. The sea spray felt strong. We tore our clothing off and ran into the ice cold water. I felt the searing heat of the mushrooms inside me making it possible and I couldn't believe I was in the water. I felt paranoid that I would drown because I was high, but realized that my muscles were more responsive than ever, and I had almost supernatural strength. I flashed back to when I was three years old, swimming in the same water, and I was truly alive.
