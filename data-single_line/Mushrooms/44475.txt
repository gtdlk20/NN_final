11:20 I've hit a plateau and even though the visuals are still very strong, I understand once again that this is just a drug.  We lay in bed for 30 more minutes and I tell her I can feel an orgasm coming on.  And I feel it too, not in the genitals, but in fibre of my body.  It spreads from inside out and I begin to shake and there is a beautiful flash of brilliant light in my head.  I am in total ecstacy.  I recover and this happens again minutes later.
