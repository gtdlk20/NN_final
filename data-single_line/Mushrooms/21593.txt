That all changed in one night; the night I decided it would be a good idea to experiment with hallucinogens. That one night, I had such a radical shift in perspective, that it changed everything I had believed up until that point about not only reality and existence itself, but it changed my mind about what I previously thought the after life entailed. It is my pleasure to finally be able to put the experience in words.
