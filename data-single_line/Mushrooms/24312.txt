I only made it through a few track of 'Ziggy Stardust', imagining 70s Bowie as fake, fag, hag scarecrow. Lester Bangs's assessment of him as a poser and phony came to mind and after a few sublime tracks the album became annoying. I turned it off and put on the mix disc I had made the night before. With the mix disc whispering through the flat, after swift rejection of venturing outside into the cold, I went to the bedroom for change of scene. On top of the covers, curled in ball, I found myself on the 'Lost' island, sensing the character Hurly around. Staring into a rock I drifted out of my body and this reality and down through and into holes in the finest detail of the stone, which became hive-like segments, this came with an a feeling of utter comfort and relaxation. I felt in place and utterly peaceful.
