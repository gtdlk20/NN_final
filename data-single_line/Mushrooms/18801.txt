9:34 (T+49) : Fuck ! My last note on the diary was only one minute earlier ? It seemed like at least 20 minutes ! Anyway, I wrote down that I realised something really important about myself. I was always worrying too much in my life. Instead of doing experiences (and I'm here not talking only about taking psychedelics, I'm talking about any experience you can do with your life) and then learn from them, I was always asking myself too many questions and it was preventing me from living. I decided at this time that I would care less about such questions and do more. At this time, it was really difficult to focus, and writing down was taking a lot of time, because I was always finding something better to write, about something completely different. I was telling myself all the time 'Man ! Write something, finish your sentence and see later about the rest'.
