We went into the room with the giant tank, and lights began to flicker out of the corner of my eye, and that's when I knew I had started to trip. The room had WAY too many people in it, so we wondered off to the Jelly exhibit and watched these things...it was friggin amazing...just watching them glow and move....wow...
