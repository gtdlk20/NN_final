T+1:00 - The auditory effects are getting better-stronger, All the voices in the mall seem to be in my head instead of where the people are, hard to explain. The visuals have picked up a lot too. We stopped in the hall for S to look at something in a store window for a few seconds, and when I went to tie my shoe I noticed that the floor in front of me had a ripple in it like dropping something in still water, but the ripples moved much slower, when I stood up it was normal once again.
