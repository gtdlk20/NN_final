The place seemed much brighter. I went into my room and felt much better that I could lock the door and shut the window and not have to worry about anyone. My room appeared to have a thick mist in it but it went away after a minute or two. I turned on my computer and connected to the internet. At this point I could not make my mind up about anything. I wanted to find my friend on ICQ and tell him I was tripping but he was not there. Then I wanted to email him and started to write one but it was getting too weird and I thought he would think I was nuts so I did not send it. Then I wanted to tell anyone I was tripping and someone popped in on random. I got nervous about telling her because I did not want her to judge me and think I was a bad person. This whole time the screen was blazing in colors. The windows on the screen were distorting and all had color outlines. I would want to watch a movie then change my mind. I was trying to get everything perfect but I could not figure out what that was. I remembered I had some really good ambient trippy mp3Â’s so I decided to put them on.
