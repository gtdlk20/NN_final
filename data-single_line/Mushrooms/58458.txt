I had gone home, the time now around 6pm. Upon arrival I went to the bathroom.  I ended up staring at myself in the mirror because the reflection looked different the normal and it felt odd looking at what is always expected to seem the same was suddenly very unfamiliar. I lie in bed and stare at ceiling till returning to baseline. I went to sleep and woke up the next morning 'homesick', but wasn't compelled to eat them again.
