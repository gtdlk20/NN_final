(01:07) I glance over at M, who is practicing yoga on one of our oriental carpets, and become filled with overwhelming love for her. This isnÂ’t anything out of the norm, but in this hyper-sensitive state, the love I feel for her seems to be present in every fiber of my being as an increasingly warm energy. It feels as if a star is being born within the center of my chest. As I look down at my pants, I can almost perceive each individual atom; every electron whipping around the nucleus at the designated 2200 km/s. Both M and I concur we are at a plus two (++).
