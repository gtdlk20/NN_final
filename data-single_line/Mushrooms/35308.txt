I've always been a fan of psychedelics. Over the years Ive come to believe that the scope for insight and self-improvement whilst under the influence of the aforementioned is not only priceless and unparalleled, but also divine and sacred. You may say Im a dreamer, but Im not the only one. My first forays into the realms of expanded consciousness were typical. Marijuana, then ecstasy and lsd, gave me happy, euphoric experiences that re-affirmed my faith in life itself.
