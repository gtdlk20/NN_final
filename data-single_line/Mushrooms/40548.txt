Due to the nausea and a general feeling of lethargy, I prefer acid over mushrooms, for me I feel like I have a poison in my body with mushrooms, and the body load is quite high. Nevertheless, despite at one point regretting the trip, by the end I was glad I took it. For me, I have always loved the afterglow.
