By the third stage of my high, although I was really enjoying the hallucinations, I started having a bad head trip.  I felt terrified for now reason at all, and very very depressed about the most minute insecurities I have about myself.  And my emotions were changing rapidly...one minute I'd be cracking up, the next minute crying (literally).  Then things got too trippy for me to handle, probably only because I had no experience with this drug before.  I was with a friend (who was totally sober), and every time I said something I was totally convinced that I was speaking in my friends' voice.  It sounded exactly the same to me.  Then I looked at him, and because convinced that I was looking in a mirror, and that I was identical to him.  I kept shouting at him to tell me who I am, what my name was, that I was my own being.  He thought it was amusing, so he played along.  Then I remember playing a video game, in a different part of my house, and thinking to myself, 'wait, did all that just happen?  Or did I imagine the entire thing?  Wasn't I just in that other room?'  Nothing made sense at all, and this kind of total loss of rationality through me into a panic.  I was very scared of being on my own, of not knowing what was real anymore.  My friend quickly talked me out of it, and the rest of the time was mostly enjoyable.  Next time I'll probably do around 2grams, and see if that's a little more under control.
