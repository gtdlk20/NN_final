We reach the sub shop, All 3 of us go inside me and B cannot stop laughing at anything and just feel ridiculous and everyone was staring at us so we just left straight up and sat outside behind the building waiting for T. NOW!!!! While we were waiting here there were this group of white kids in track suits (Yes track suits) holding bags of chewing tobacco (yes ziploc bags) and they asked us if we were blazed and stuff we just said yeah we smoked a quarter and I thought B knew them... It was the weirdest fucking incident ever and when i found out they were 100% random and none of them knew any of us I thought it was ridiculous And everything was still funny for know reason.
