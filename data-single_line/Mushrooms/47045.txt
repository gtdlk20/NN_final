45 minutes go by and I start to trip pleasantly. Despite the dark, I could see as good as a bat in the darkest corners of the property. Every detail and decoration was magnified and vivid. A man/woman walks by, steals a glance, and it was like I knew exactly what that person was thinking. I saw good souls and a few bad souls wander by all night. The expression on my face took on a jovial air like that on LSD and my inner glow that comes out only through psychedelics, starts growing in my tummy, causing me to grin against will. The drum circles were growing rapidly and the party sounded intense, so I decided to halt my trip around the area and join a circle.
