Soon I felt complete ego death, I felt part as though my body was now just another part of this new world. I was lying on a bed and I honestly thought that I had melted and merged with it and was now just a consciousness within the room. The room seemed infinitely huge, my perception of distance and time was altered. I remember sitting on a chair and looking down at the carpet, which seemed to far away inducing the feeling that I was a bird, perched on a ledge high up looking down upon a unfamiliar world.
