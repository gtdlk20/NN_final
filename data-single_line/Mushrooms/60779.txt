Then I remembered that I had some left over syrian rue seeds so I began to chew on them I had about 6 or 8 caps worth. After this point I reached the level that I was looking for and it was then that the climax began. It was now around 11:30 and I decided that I had to go on a journey to find the boundaries of reality, it was then that I left my house to go and wander the world so weed lighter and pipe in hand I began this quest, I had walked about Â¼ of a mile when a large chariot of angels approached and the chariot stopped and I climbed on, all ready riding the chariot was two beings one with hair of fire and the other was unseen just a dark outline, (this turned out being my friend in his big white hummer and his read head girlfriend). It was then that while riding the glorious chariot that I explored the boundaries of reality, using what seemed like the speed of light we traveled the world, but one of the beings, the one with hair made of fire fell of and fell into the world around us, It was then that I pulled out my tools and began to burn all of the trees in the basin (I started smoking again). Suddenly though I too fell of the glorious chariot into the world surrounding me it was then that I wandered through every place of unfamiliarity until I reached a familiar place, I had by this time walked about 4 miles and it was probably around 3 o clock in the morning and I then finally found my house, I walked in and climbed to the clouds where I blessed my burnt offerings and burned them (incense) and I again burned the trees in the basin, at this point I finally fell into a dream that I cannot even describe or explain.
