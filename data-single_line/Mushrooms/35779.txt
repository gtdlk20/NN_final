I was fourteen when I had my first experience with magic mushrooms.  My older sister (A), who has always been more knowledgable about psychoactive substances than me, got about around 6 grams through her boyfriend (Z), which the three of us planned to take together as a group.  This was a little unnerving, as I didn't know what to expect from shrooms, much less what to expect from them in a group.  But after a short while my anxiety subsided, mostly because it was only going to be me, my sister, and her BF.
