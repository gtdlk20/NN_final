Surprisingly, this certain batch of mushrooms weren't as bad as the ones I've had to choke down in the past, though they were aweful nonetheless. Within 15 minutes I had downed my stash, and my friend was just finishing up. It became apparent that we were in for a hell of a night when 15 minutes later I felt a change of thought and started detecting minor visuals. I did not feel the need to vomit, which was odd as the four times before I was sick for the first half hour. I wasn't up for complaining about it though, and we put on a chill CD and made ourselves comfortable on the living room couch. The sun was about a half hour away form setting, so we had plenty of time to relax before viewing the spectacular show in the sky.
