The next thing I remember is that I heard a voice in my mind telling me that I needed to work on my laziness. I heard a voice in my mind telling me that I needed to work on my laziness. A Father figure also asked me to forgive him for raping me. I still am not sure who this Father figure was, maybe a past life memory or something. But I do know that the first voice was Jesus Christ or Adonis as I now know Him to be also. About 6 months after the trip I started talking to him in my mind without being on shrooms. We talk everyday now all the time. I am also talking to Archangel Michael a little each day.
