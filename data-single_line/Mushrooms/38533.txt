After walking up to the Tesco shopping center to buy some ciggies. I started trying to realign myself with reality once more, trying to keep positive thoughts. I keep running through my head that it was all simply the effects of the drugs taking control and falsifying my senses. Once I managed to pull myself out of my mad patterns of thought I decided to leave my friends, who where much in the same mind set as myself and walk home on my own. Things started getting better, although my senses were still incredibly inverted I kept reassuring myself that once the effects of the drugs wore off I my senses would realign back to their natural configuration. Yet there was still that question in the back of my mind that perhaps now I had entered and experienced this insane state of mind, that I would never again return to normality.
