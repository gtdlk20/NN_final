The movie ended and we returned to my room to smoke a bowl and come down; I was lost as I loaded the pipe, confused about what the world was, I had begged for a sign to see what I would do in life and was shown the lies that surrounded the everyday life of a person and the ways of the world all suddenly seemed so clear.  The was a feeling I'd had before, but this time it was much more overwhelming and intense, at this point I ate the last bit of my bag; I did have an extended peak due to this, but not as confusing and chaotic as the first one had been.
