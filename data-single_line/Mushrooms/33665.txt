We continued our distracted trek into the woods with the intent to take a peek at the civilization that existed on the other side of the woods. About 2/3 of the way there P sat down and refused to go any further, insisting that he had a bad feeling about. This frustrated T and I to no end, as neither of us had any mediation skills at that point. For a while we joyfully argued with P about where we wanted to go, when finally we realized that no matter what weÂ’d be happy and we might as well humor P. On the way back T began complaining about everything and I started to get annoyed, until I realized that he was thoroughly enjoying himself.
