From here the effects began to intensify noticeably.  The campfire seemed brighter and surreal-looking.  I got up and wandered back towards the area where the music was playing. It was pitch black except for a glowing coming from the music area, and at one point I thought I saw someone moving in the darkness a few feet away from me.  I moved closer to investigate (no one was there), and in doing so my foot slipped into a rut in the ground and gave me a jolt.  At the exact moment that my foot hit the rut, I had a very brief but intense 'hallucination'.  It was as if my vision were composed of a matrix of hexagonal shapes (kind of like this: <=>), and upon my foot hitting the ground, the entire matrix lit up, covering my field of vision in a geometric pattern.
