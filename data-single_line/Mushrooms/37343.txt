It was like a magical Easter-egg hunt, dashing through beautiful hills, finding secrets that appeared to be calling out to us.  The illicit thrill of being on someone elses land, and the adrenaline kept us going as much as the reward.  The task itself was definitely a part of that reward.  I couldnt remember having that much fun in a long time.  After a few hours hunting we had gathered about a pound of shrooms ranging from 1 to 6 inches in length, and decided to head for home.
