Energized by this I decided that we move to my back yard.  Still fixed on the leaves, I decided to lay on my back and stare up at the cherry blossom tree which hung over my porch. It was beautiful. GF joined me, while #1 grabbed my guitar. The guitar was really out of tune, and the sound of him tightening the strings was really trippy and sent me into a kind of body buzz. GF and I started scratching each others heads, and although there wasnÂ’t really anything wrong with it, it felt very sexual. She started to moan and purr, and I felt really bad about it later because it sent my friend into a really uncomfortable trip.  A little later, I laid flat on my stomach while she laid on top of me. The sensation I felt can only be described as being hugged by a big cuddly octopus.
