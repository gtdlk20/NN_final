At some point (maybe +1 hour in) I got horribly cold while I was lying on the couch. It was such an intense internal cold it was hard to make myself warm, even though A brought me a fur coat to keep me warm. He also came to lie with me on the couch, but at this point I was having all the negative feelings towards him, and felt like he was suffocating me, and told him I felt bad having him near me. I even felt bad having him in the same room, but there was nowhere to go really, the studio was very small, and I felt I couldnÂ’t go outside in this state.
