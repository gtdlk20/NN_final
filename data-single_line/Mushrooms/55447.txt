I tried to get a group of 3 people, including myself to go to the park and trip out, this was going to be my 4th time eating mush, but it turned out to be my 1st time at level 2, as the first 3 were level 1. I got to level 2 because I had an empty stomach, and I liked the visuals a heck of alot. I only managed to get 1 friend with me, so we set out to the park with a lake.
