12:30 pm: Attempted to microdose a few caps of mushrooms and go to the store. On my way to the store, I began to shake and my hands on steering wheel began to have a fluid texture to them. Realized IÂ’d taken too much, so I decided to go home and finish the full dose, since I was already feeling it.
