 I found this noisy interruption and talking threw me out of my calm tripping space. Suddenly I was all anxious and fidgetty again, having difficulty finding a comfortable way to lay. I tried laying on my back, but found it disconcerting looking up at the ceiling. I really wanted to stay where I could watch the candle, as I found it very comforting and grounding for me. So I lay back on my side, and eventually was able to calm down and start tripping nicely again. Just then, when I was feeling good and thinking the candle would be my safety net, my anchor point for the night, Goopstar leaned over suddenly and blew out the candle! The room plunged into darkness. All I could see was a tiny little orange glow from the tip of the wick, which went out after a few seconds.
