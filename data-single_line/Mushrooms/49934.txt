I was driving and I knew it was not the smartest thing to be doing. The lights were just crazy and the music was so intense. I was listening to a ska compilation called 'Ska Sucks' and it just FELT really intense. Soon I realized that driving was not treating me well, so I went to this park. I just sat there and put in the nearest CD, the Eurythmics Greatest Hits. This is not typically the type of music I listen to, but music is very important to me when I'm tripping and the Eurythmics were great. I just layed down in my backseat and crazy, colorful psycodelic open-eye visuals flooded my sight. It was a really psycodelic trip. Soon the visuals got so strong I couldn't see what was around me. All I could see were the visuals, I felt like I was blind. I guess that it started getting really hot in my car, because I kept feeling like I had pissed on myself, and I kept turning the light on to make sure that I hadn't (I heard a horror story one time about someone who urinated all over the place when they were shrooming and I think that that story kept creeping into my mind), and sure enough, I hadn't but I felt totally wet. It felt like there was moss growing on my hands and I would claw at it and it felt like I was pulling it off and I could feel it under my nails but it was regenerate and grow back.
