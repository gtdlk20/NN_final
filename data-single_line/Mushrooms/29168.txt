At about 10mins the first glimpses of visual effects started showing and at about 15mins into it the visuals assumed a kind of theme - something like an Aztec or Olmec city with vivid artwork embedded into the walls and tiles.  That alone was beautiful enough to have made it worthwhile and I knew that a fast come-on would deliver something awesome.
