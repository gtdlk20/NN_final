After about half an hour the mushrooms started to kick in. It was a relatively pleasant ascent, with no major stomach and body discomfort. As usual, lights became brighter, and the tapestry of the air in the room started to become more visible, undulating softly. Merc and our other friend were having a philosophical conversation reflecting on the Mysteries that have been revealed to us through the shaman earlier that day. The amount of information that was presented to us was absolutely unbelievable and totally astounding. Sometimes I joined the discussion, but was more trying to focus on the onset of the trip.
