Even though it felt like days had passed, I was sure it wasn't too late to call Jake, seeing as he is often up very late. I looked at my clock, and the twisted, almost unrecognizable numbers said the time was 11:40. I knew I could call Jake. I searched for my cell phone, but it was nowhere to be found. Again the fear grew within me, but I soon realized what became my savior that night: things make sense. I realized that on some basic level, things make sense. Thus I knew how to find my phone. I located the charger cable and followed it to the power socket, from where I followed it back to its end, in my bed. There was no phone on the end of it, but I knew this must mean that it was on my bedside table. How I knew this, I cannot explain. I just knew it.
