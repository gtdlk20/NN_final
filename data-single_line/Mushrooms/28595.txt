Anyways, as I was about to sit down and type, I realized how I was feeling so much smarter and sharper, like my mind is going a million miles an hour.  I also realized that one of the things in my 'master plan' for self improvement was to start making lists of all the things I need to do and remember and start making schedules, so I decided to just real quickly put my list together.  First I started with safety equipment I've kept telling myself I need to buy, but never feel like I have the money for when I see.  While I was in this state, I realized how stupid it was because dying early because I didn't buy stuff or teach the kids basic emergency skills and drills, what to do in different types of emergencies.
