After we had finished that eigth Alucard decided he didn't want to waste any more of his mushies, so he gave me and our other friend each a cap and a few stems to eat, in hopes of stimulating some sort of effect.  After a little bit, I don't remember how long exactly, I started to feel something.  It felt like I was really really stoned.  I had an incredible body high; it just felt great to sit there and not move at all.  I was so relaxed that my body was on the verge of sleep, but I kept telling myself that I needed to stay awake to experience this.
