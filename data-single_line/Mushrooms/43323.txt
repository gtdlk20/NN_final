About 15 minutes later we were pushed outside after someones mom came home. I was sitting in the seat of a truck, doors open, talking to my friend when I noticed something felt odd. I couldnt tell if I was still high or if the shrooms had kicked in. Make a quick note here, any substance taken as a liquid gets absorbed into the body twice as fast since the stomach has no solids to break down. We eventually started driving downtown. About five minutes in my friend commented that she had lost her phone and wanted to drive back and get it, we didnt.
