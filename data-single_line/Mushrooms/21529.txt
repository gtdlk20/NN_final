The first trip was quite visual- and fun (3.5g cubes).  I enjoyed it but was kind of disappointed that it ended up in me losing consciousness and waking up just to be kind of dumbfounded, stuck in that slow time many experience.  I did have to face the background noises of neighbors in a paranoid state, which I thought was going to drive me crazy!  But amazingly, the next day and days after- I have realized that my hyper sensitivity to background noises no longer bothered me.  I suppose it was an OCD or ADD symptom that I learned to grow out of?
