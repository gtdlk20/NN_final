A girl beside me asked if I had any foundation.  I looked up at her with wide eyes.  Why did she have to ask now?  It took me a while to realize what I was doing, but I eventually gave it to her and muttered a few words to her.  Once again, I thought to myself that she KNEW I was tripping my ass off.  I backed away from the crowd of people at the sinks.  Then I looked over a little girl washing her hands.  She had soap on her hands, then she put them together and started praying right there on the sink.  She muttered words that didn't seem of this world, then quickly looked over at me.  In no time at all, her face began to decay!  I got so scared I tried to run out of the bathroom.  People were blocking my way.  It seemed as if they were all in on it.  It was a conspiricy against me!
