All my friends were fucking ridiculously drunk about 20-30 mins after my arrvial to the rooms (biggest light wieghts). Anyways they decided they wanted to explore the city now. I didn't feel up to it anymore since I was enjoying my window. So my drunk friend J stayed behind to watch over me. This where I began tripping hard I put on a doors cd and was fueled by Jim Morrison's lyrics. I yelled at my friend that I was the lizard king. He told me later that he was shocked at my behavoir since he had never seen anyone on shrooms. He turned off the music and I was immediatly calmed down by his voice which seemed to float in soothing waves. He began drinking his personal bottle of JD since my other friends had divided the handle of vodka into water bottles so they could drink on the run.
