I panicked for seconds, then began chanting some Hindu mantras from Krishna Das.  The chant was powerful enough to focus and balance my attention.  I continued chanting for maybe ten minutes, somewhat afraid to stop because I could not tell if the threatening psychic energies would return.  It was clear that I would sustain some kind of musical rhythm for the rest of the trip to help maintain balance.  It seemed as if some of my own shamanic potentials were revealed as I skillfully controlled my fear and transformed it.
