My sister's friend parked her car and as we were walking down a LARGE street towards the hookah bar, Ace just kept yelling out 'IT'S THE WEEKEND!!' over and over and over again. We found a seat in the front of the hookah bar and ordered a hookah and a round of waters. The place was EXTREMELY busy and loud hip-hop music was playing, which is not really my choice of music. My sister and her friend knew a few people there and were chatting with them. I was mostly just sitting quietly and enjoying the colors, lights, and people watching. I felt pretty paranoid still like everyone was watching us, but I just tried to keep my cool and make sure that Ace was doing okay. Our hookah was brought out and we each took turns smoking out of the hose. Both Ace and I were fascinated by the metallic swirly patterns on the hookah and chatted about this for quite some time. This seemed to calm my paranoia and I began feeling more comfortable and chatty with everyone at our table.
