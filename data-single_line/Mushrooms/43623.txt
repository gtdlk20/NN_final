6:28:(my roommate) came a couple minutes ago asking what year my car was. What the [expletive] does he want to know? [sic]  And he won't tell me why he was asking. Josse doesn't ask about [expletive] just because. He's the most casually criminal person I know and now I'm all paranoid because he just asked me that out of the blue.
