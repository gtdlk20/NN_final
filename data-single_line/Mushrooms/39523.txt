Now I'm not normally a very nature-oriented person.  One might even call me cynical.  But when I stared out across the lake, I was taken aback by the beauty.  The sky, the grass rippling in the gentle breeze, the water...all seemed so perfect. And I was very at peace.  I felt united with the earth.  I sat at the edge of the lake and started thinking about your typical 'complexities of the universe' type things...how complex and precise everything is, from solar systems to ecological systems right down to the smallest one celled organism.  it was a blitzkrieg of thought.  There was a single thorny bush in the grass at the edge of the lake, and it arrested my attention for awhile.  I kneeled by it and I think I actually talked to it. it didn't talk back. I moved my hands along it, feeling its texture.
