Then after a short while I started thinking what I should do, I was somehow bored. The music was alright but it didnt interest me too much at this point and I felt a bit unprepared. What do people do when they use shrooms? I started thinking that maybe I hadnt really thought this through. I started wondering why I took shrooms in the first place - basically Im just messing with my brain, that actually doesnt seem like such a good idea. Shouldnt I have outgrown this? What was I expecting anyway? Shrooms dont have answers, at least not anything I cant figure out in my normal life.
