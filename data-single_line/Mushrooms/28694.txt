Much later in life, having read some Terence McKenna and his description of encounters with elves during DMT experiences, I realized with some relief that I had encountered these Elves but I only heard them; evidently my dose wasnt high enough to break-through and see or interact with them. Apparently these beings are typical for drugs in the tryptamine family. The fact that they can be encountered consistently by anyone suggests of course that in a way thats difficult to categorize, they exist. And they are goofy.
