First stage, body fry. Felt a little bit of discomfort in my stomach. Not an ache, not nausea just a little bit of discomfort, it was tolerable. Go downstairs to watch a movie and I'm already feeling something after about 15-20 minutes. Slight distoritions in perception kind of similar to 'visuals' when I'm way stoned, only, my mind seems more clear. We move up to my friend's room and we chill there. About 30 minutes after dosing probably, and I get hit with ecstasy. I was happy as all hell, laughing my brains out, enjoying looking at more or less anything. Things seem to stretch, colors are accented and move rapidly, some things bulge and the ceiling 'womps' up and down. Walking is possible, with some weaving. After the happiness passed everything was still slightly distorted and I thought after that, that I had perhaps peaked (ha!).
