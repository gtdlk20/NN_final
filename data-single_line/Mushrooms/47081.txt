Then I went crazy. I quickened my pace because something inside of me convinced me that I had just raped someone, or maybe simply just sexually insulted someone, or even killed someone, and if I get seen by the wrong people, Im fucked. I was convinced that I just didn't remember doing it. I stumbled along, tripping out on this new paranoid delusion, then I got horribly, excruciatingly depressed and sat down in this clearing and put my face in my hands started crying, and repeating over and over again, 'I didn't do anything wrong, it's just the shrooms, I believe in god and god knows I didnt mean whatever I did. I didn't do anything, Ill comedown and Ill laugh at myself, I didnt do anything.'
