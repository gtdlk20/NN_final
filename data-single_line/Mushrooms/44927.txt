Anyway, so we decided to drive down to our friend's apartment to pick them up. We got there and picked up 5 1/8's, one more eigth than we expected. We then drove over to our other friends apartment where three of us each ate an eigth. We spent some time in the apartment listening to music but it was really hot so we went down to the water to relax. We played frisbee for a while and just pretty much chilled out. The boomers were hitting us and we were laughing and I had some mild visuals. My mind was still intact though, and after a walk around town my friend and I decided to leave and head back home (about a 45 minute drive). I guess our minds must have still been a little crazed becuase on the begining of the drive home we decided to both eat another eigth and just finish the bag.
