Depression? I dont think that psilocybin is a cure for clinical depression, but in my case (minor depression and inertness) I know that it was beneficial. It has shaken my paradigm and reawakened a deeper appreciation of the sublime and mystical nature of life. I no longer live life as a soulless Cartesian. It has also -without a doubt- raised my sensitivity toward others; and that is truly a good thing.
