I mean there are aliens here in this room right now and they were operating and doing something to my head. When he heard that, he was like No way! Are you serious?? and started laughing really loud. The alien spirits then looked at him, looked at me, looked at each other, and in an instant like wind trailed out of my perception and disappeared. It seemed they didnt like the vibe of Mercs laugh. That maybe his laugh gave a sense of a slight disbelief. I got a feeling that were like This guy laughing doesnt know anything.
