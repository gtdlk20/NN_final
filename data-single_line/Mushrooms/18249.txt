Syph has a very squishy nose, and he often makes people feel it just to understand its level of mushiness.  We have rules when tripping -- no touching, no splashing, no following, no fucking around with anyone.  I announced that I wanted to break the rule to touch Syph's nose, and he was fine with that.  As I smushed the cartilage mass down,  his facial features suddenly sprouted.  He has very heavy brows, a big nose, and a large jaw.  I looked at him, and all those features grew out in relief.  Everyone else was looking at him, and we started laughing at Syph's face.  Syph was also laughing.  Clock said, 'Syph, you're kinda weird looking, huh?'
