We talked for about 45 minutes, just about random things, and what I was feeling. I paced back and forth in my room about 200 times. As the walls breathed, and the floor kept moving. Walking was tricky, but the floor wasn't trying to hurt me, it was only playful. She said her mom was calling her, and she had to go. I was a bit disappointed, but very excited to see what I could experience. I kept feeling like I could walk through walls, and I did try, though not running at it, just putting my hand up to it. Although I obviously could not. I decided I was hungry and went downstairs into the kitchen. Surprisingly the stairs were not at all hard to climb down, although I expected them to be. I made some oatmeal with a little sugar in it, and brought it upstairs and watched TV as I ate it.
