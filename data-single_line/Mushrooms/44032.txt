The world started to feel 'flat.' everything was perfect. I looked at the world around me and said it felt like Alice in Wonderland, I was the madhatter and he was Alice, nothing made sense, R kept repeating that 'Nothing makes sense, I'm just so high.' R kept trying to roll his joint and eventually did light it after 5-6 reminders of what he was doing, I'm not sure if we ever finished smoking it. R went inside but I said 'I want to play, do you have a ball?' After a bit of searching I found a basketball and started dancing on his trampoline bouncing the ball, remember the DMT trip on Rick and Morty, I shouted, I fucking shouted, 'I am TIME.' I started thinking about how life is a constant struggle to express ideas, I started to think about how 'No thank you' or 'I love you' are the shortest yet most powerful phrases in existence, I thought about it all, I felt complete euphoria. I went to lay down and stared at the sky, the sky started to shift into several octagons which turned into a being I could recognize, I immediately thought it was God, although now I believe it to be nothing but an extension of how I think. It said to me, 'You're doing good, you're a good guy, you're gonna go to heaven. Just stop being so mean.' 'You're doing good, you're a good guy, you're gonna go to heaven. Just stop being so mean.' I felt enlightened from these almost childish words and went to reply until I heard R shout, 'Yo, come inside.'
