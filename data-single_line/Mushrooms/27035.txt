My auditory issues had gone beyond their volume and right on to straight hallucination. If I had to make a guess I would say that my ears at that moment in time were in a direct link to that part of the brain that gets a song stuck in it for days at a time. I was hearing things from my environment and they were sticking to my brain like cheerios on a spoon covered in honey. The sound of leaves blowing in the wind from outside, the sound of an emergency vehicle that I think actually passed by (I cant be sure), the sound of a telephone ringing, various voices (female and male), and a bunch of various noises that sounded like old stock Star Trek sound effects, had all jumbled themselves in my brain and formed a track that lasted about five seconds. It sounded like a crude song that some experimental band might create. I didnt find it frightening I found it absolutely maddening. It was so loud and so saturating that could no longer focus on actual thoughts with real substance (like where I was or how I had gotten there). All that I had left were the traces of fear, dread, regret, and paranoia that had been imprinted on my psyche.
