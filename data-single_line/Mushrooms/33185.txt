Sitting on the pan and returning to it about 3 times made me feel convinced that ms would likely always give me a shitty reaction. Now thats all very well when I have my capacity to get to the toilet seat and dump it all out  so I feel I was doing fine to be on a level 2 bad trip where I had all my bodily functions and could manage all that. Grateful for bodily functions.
