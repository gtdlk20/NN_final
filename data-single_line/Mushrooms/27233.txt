Later, once again thinking the trip was over, I called my girlfriend, and asked her to come over.  We were sitting on my couch and her face began to turn green.  I was in the state of feeling like I was born again.  I told her I was tripping and she was about to leave.  Suddenly, when she was at the door, my face turned pale, I broke into a cold sweat, got dizzy, and ran into the bathroom.  I puked up about 4 or so shrooms.  I looked in the mirror and my eyes were DILATED like a mother fucker.  I sat against the bathroom wall to recover, shut my eyes, and saw sparkling, swimming, three dimensional green beads, flowing like water.  As I was talking to her, every time I shut my eyes I saw something different.  A paint brush and palette, various pictures, all very vivid and realistic.
