T++3:56: I finish up my notes and feel proud that I'd managed to write so much. The sense of pride is overwhelming, it feels like a soothing but incredibly powerful warmth in my stomach that's expanding rapidly and needing to escape from my body. I open my mouth and when I do I realise I have really bad cotton mouth again. I decide to have fun for the rest of my trip, and play the melodica (I'm a bit better at this one) and find myself making quite complex melodies, I enjoy this a lot and get quite caught up in it as I did on the piccolo.
