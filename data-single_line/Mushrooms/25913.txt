In the dim light of the living room I assessed the intensity of my visions to be somewhere in the 3 gram range.  But everything was still shimmering with beauty and meaning.  I have to admit I felt some relief.  I decided I had to go outside and check out the night sky.  Outside I gazed in wonder at the stars and trees.  Astonishing beauty.  Finishing my cigarette and somewhat afraid that someone might come along and try to converse with me, I head back inside where I poured over a book of impressionist art (which was somewhat unimpressive) and then a volume of Escher.  I laughed and cried over the intricate brilliance of his work.  It was here that I first took notice of the high-pitch, repetitive, electronic noise in my head.  I ignored it with some success.
