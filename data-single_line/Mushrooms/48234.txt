The night ended with one more beautiful, if extra long walk through the Quad looking at the glowing sky and falling snow, then finally crashing out in my room as the drug left my system. The amazing thing is however, that if you figure (and this is for me alone) that it takes about a 50 oz. of beer to get me drunk, and it takes .75 grams for me to trip, then the equivalent beer intake of taking 3.5 grams of shrooms (an 1/8th) is 282 ozs. Thats a little over 7 40s (40 ounces of beer), which would, Im sure, kill me, considering I drank 2 quickly and puked for an hour. But the amazing thing is, that the next morning, after sleeping only 7 or 8 hours, I felt perfect. Refreshed, energized, and ready for the dance audition I had in the following three hours. And just let the record show, I got a call back :-D.
