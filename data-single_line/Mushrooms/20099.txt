I got on another train and arrived at the science museum about 2 hours after I had originally eaten the mushrooms.  I went in and felt somewhat paranoid.  The place was mostly empty, and I didnt like people looking at me.  I looked around at some of the exhibits but quickly worked my way outside, where there was a large collection of animals.  I stayed out there, and stared at some of the animals in turn  reptiles, birds, amphibians, insects, and all sorts of critters.  I felt a sort of connection to them, which deepened the longer I stared; it was almost meditative.  While I was doing this, I ate the last 2.5 grams of my mushrooms over the course of about 30 minutes.  I was super calm now, and not much mushroom was in effect.
