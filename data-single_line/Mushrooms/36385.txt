We travelled into a hotel where I heard an ascending buzz, ending with the slam of a door (this all came from my mind).  By this time I felt like the white rabbit, late for the quest that I had already embarked upon.  Mushroom empathy seemed to me rather satirical, opposed to DXM where I love everything for what it is.  I suppose I am rambling, so to get to the point, I felt like I needed more.  The insight went only so far, but each peak was different.  It has been months since the experience, but the contemplative period does not seem to have ceased.  I don't know how to explain it exactly, but psychedelics seem to truly open the mind if taken with that goal in mind.
