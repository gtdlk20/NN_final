I am now several days into this pattern, mostly headache-free during the day, then treating the evening monster with 0.3g.  It disappears within 20 minutes, I again can't stress enough how incredible that is.  And I'm then allowed to sleep through the night, untreated there's usually two 60-minute-long nightmares per night.
