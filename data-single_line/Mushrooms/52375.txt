Last July 4th, I went to my brother's house to barbecue, crack a cold one, and partake of some fungus that we had been waiting on for several weeks.  Upon seeing the scant quantity that my brother's friend had given him, I was rather deflated and told my brother that it wouldn't be enough to really give us both a good buzz.  I had previous experiences with mushrooms, and what we had appeared to be about a gram and a half at most.
