Crawling into bed, I began to calm down and enjoy my state a lot more, although it wasn't unequivocally pleasant.  I remember telling my girlfriend that I had almost just killed myself.  After a few panicked questions, I reassured her enough that she went back to sleep.  I started feeling strange delusions.  I began to regard it as true that I was the only real person on Earth and that I was just waking up from a period of dreaming the memories of my life up to that point. I began to regard it as true that I was the only real person on Earth and that I was just waking up from a period of dreaming the memories of my life up to that point.  I felt that I was in an in-between period of remembering my (up until now, real) life and that the things that I had done during that life were the only possible actions; that by doing them, I had defined the set of possibilities for the rest of my eternity.  I lay in bed, remembering my life and waiting for the next phase of existence to begin, feeling relief at a chance to put the worries of this world behind me.  I just lay there, smiling and waiting.
