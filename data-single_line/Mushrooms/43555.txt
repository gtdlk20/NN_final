My speech is slurred, but I was able to help Nate and Steve gain some insight to their trips. I showed them the way by explaining how crazy my body high felt and the shapes of the hallucinations I was seeing. I told them that we were all in this together and I wouldn't let them have a bad trip. This reassured them and they didn't look quite as scared. John expressed that he couldn't understand how Pete and I would just lose it one minute, then be in control the next. It was like the newbies always want to have control of things during the trip, and the masters just let things flow. They were afraid to embarrass themselves by tripping too hard, and I'll bet that's pretty paranoid.
