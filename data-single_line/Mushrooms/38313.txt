At first I physically felt nothing, my body was numb from head to toe. I was looking at everything through a new pair of eyes. Everything in front of me began to melt and twist together into a whole, losing all individuality. Every action, every thought, everything in general, all became one large manifestation. I saw everything not only for what it appeared to me, but for what it was in part of the manifestation. The earth itself felt as if it were a single organism acting within itself.
