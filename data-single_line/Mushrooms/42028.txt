T +0:40 -  I am definitely feeling something.  A slight buzzing of the ears, my mouth is watering, my stomach is dancing.  I feel a speed-like effect.  I got some soda and switched the player over to Aphex Twin, as this was not going to be an average afternoon.  I tried to go back in the living room to spend time with my girl, but the lack of light and loud TV really make me uncomfortable.  I'll stay in the office, where I am surrounded by windows and have two lamps.  I feel stifled and hot.  I feel like I am in a dream, floating above myself.
