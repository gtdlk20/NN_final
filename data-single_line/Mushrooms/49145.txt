After an hour of sipping on the tea, the visuals started to kick in. Normally, I don't get very strong visuals, and if I do, it's cause I've been sitting still for a while. While there was five grams of shrooms total, after an hour of sipping on it I was only one-third done with the cup. Over the next hour I had fun walking around looking at the different statues, artworks, and scenery. I also had a blast walking around the vendor tents looking at glass pieces. Everything seemed to be glowing and moving in slow wavelike motions, even while I was still walking around.
