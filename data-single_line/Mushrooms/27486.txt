After wandering amongst various trees and plants that lined the sides of the road leading away from the cabin, the three of us decided to go to a river a short distance away.  Since I was the only person who had been to the cabin before, I was expected to lead us.  There was a relatively big problem with that plan, namely that I didnt know where in the hell I was.  Everything was brighter, more beautiful, full of an energy that seemed struggling to free itself from the plants, air, trees around me.  When we came to a fork in the road, we didnt know what to do.  Luckily, a dog lead us in the right direction.  We spotted him about 50 yards ahead of us, trotting along the roadside in a direction we could only assume had to be the correct one to get to the river.  The dog paused occasionally to glance at us in seeming patience, only reaffirming our notion that his express reason for existence at that moment was to lead us to the river.
