He told me I came out of the toilet, looked very groggy, came to him at the table, said to him 'Go. Now.' and then I turned around, took one step forward, stumbled into a chair and fell face-first onto the floor, without even putting up my hands to stop the fall. (Ouch!=) Now, though, we were outside, and at that stage I was NOT TRIPPING AT ALL!  I felt completely fine!  The trip finally came on again about 10-15 minutes later, and I spent the next 5-6 hours tripping at the level that one would expect from such a small dosage.  Small hallucinations, the world just seemed bright and beautiful in it's unqiue mushroomy way.
