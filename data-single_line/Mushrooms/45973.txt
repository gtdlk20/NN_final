Overall, I recommend Clonazolam to people who have one off anxiety attacks, or want to enjoy a psychedelic experience without worry. I'd recommend taking some a few hours beforehand, lightly increasing your dose, so you can get a feel for the chemical, and so that it's working while the psychedelics start to take hold. Also keep some more for a redose during the middle of the trip, as it may start to wear off. Peace and stay safe please :)
