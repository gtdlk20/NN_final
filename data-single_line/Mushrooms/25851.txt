As we smoked pot in the living room the others played some racing video game that was quite intense in a sober state. It became even more insane as the shrooms started to affect me. It took about 30 minutes to fully floor me. Once I puked in M's living room I was immediately propelled outside (in my mind; anyway). I really though that I was in the street in front of his house. That's what I saw anyway. I came back for a little while after that and we made it to the back porch.
