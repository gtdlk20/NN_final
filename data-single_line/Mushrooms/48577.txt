At that time there were only three of us awake, sitting in almost silence in the living room, with the air form outside streaming in, and we were all touching, moving, whispering, and sharing the same thoughts at the same time. It was so beautiful, being there, and then going outside for another bowl (to try to help me sleep, because I had too much stuff to do the next day). All this accomplished was making everything so much more intense; and thinking about the words 'I love you' that I had whispered quietly in the witness of nature to an incredible person that I love so much. When I closed my eyes, my imagination took hold and I became engulfed in memories and thoughts for what seemed like eternity, only to open my eyes and find that only a fraction of a second has gone by. I managed to get to sleep at about 6 in the morning, and felt groggy, happy, but exhausted the next day.
