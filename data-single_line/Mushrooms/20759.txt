Fortunately everyone had finally lightened up and were actually enjoying things. As Adam performed his monologue about me being the mad scientist, Adam had removed his fleece to reveal a well fitted black T shirt which he -- Im sure in his mind not too obviously  was carefully tucking in as he watched himself in a wall of mirrors that were in back of Kate and I. He turned around to check the back and puffed up his chest. As he turned we saw the back of his jeans and we all burst out laughing as we noticed he was wearing the gayest jeans we had ever seen. They had these ridiculous faux leather lightning bolts stitched to the rear pockets and we laughed our asses off as Adam continued to strut around sticking his ass out and cackling madly. We laughed and all had a great time the rest of the night until we all started coming down around 2:30.
