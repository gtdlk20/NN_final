After a few lifetimes of this I went inside and listened to some phish. I felt the visuals disappearing, but my mind was still going. This was the time of reflection, where I would sit and think about all of the weird crazy things that had just happened to me and what it all meant. I concluded that a trip is a very fragile thing. It is extremely sensitive to vibes and moods of other people and of yourself. I can feel someone's mood before I even say one word to them, and if the vibe is strange, it makes me feel VERY strange. Everything that happened was so intense and realistic even though I knew, and had to consistently remind myself, that it was all in my head.
