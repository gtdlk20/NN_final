After experiencing this altered mindset I was frantic, I didn't want it to go away. I knew that eventually the mushrooms would wear off and I would be stuck in normal thinking mode. It sucked. After about six or seven hours we decided to go home (it was about 6am or so) My sober friend drove me back home. After I got home the fun was sucked out of the trip. My boring room, drab colors, my parents were in the house (not awake, but still present). My head started to feel very hot and uncomfortable, an intense feeling of 'bad' enveloped me, everything sucked. My friends were gone, I was back home, I had a bad headache (and what felt like a fever). I stared out of my room for about an hour and then tried to sleep. When I closed my eyes an intense swirling/dizzy feeling came over me. I hated that as well. I eventually nodded off to sleep. I woke up with a feeling of 'thank god that trip is finally over.' I was glad to be back in reality and anxious to give it another go. I have yet to do so, but I'll post my experience when I do.
