I slowly made my way out of the forest, encountering a couple glowering, hostile guardian spirits on the way out.  They were silent, not sending any images or clear thoughts, but it was obvious they wanted me gone from that place.  I sang my melody to them, tried to convince them too that I was peaceful, but they were not swayed in their emotions.  I obliged by their wishes, and followed the path out of the forest.
