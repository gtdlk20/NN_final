(02:35) Often times while bored at work, I concentrate all of my focus on a singular point in space. Commonly referred to as the Troxler Effect, this causes the remaining perceptual field surrounding the aforementioned spatial point to melt, blur, and often align itself in 6 or 8-fold geometric patterns similar to those experienced on the common psychedelics. Although I have mild HPPD, there are numerous accounts and experiments that document these effects in healthy individuals.
