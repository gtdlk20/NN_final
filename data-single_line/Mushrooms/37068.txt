As I walked down through the park, I felt myself grow huge, tall and powerful, I could not believe it! These fucking mushrooms loved me! It was so different to LSD, I felt safe, warm and sane. A huge wave rose through me and emerged as song, I walked along singing in joy, I dont know what I was singing, but it was euphoria. It was only years later when I'd given up on the 1960s literature and read McKenna et al, that I learnt of the commonality of this experience. My song cut beauty out of the clouds, and the sun rapidly set before me, in perfect harmony with my song. All I can safely say is that it was a bluesy number!
