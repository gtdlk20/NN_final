It was apparent I was dead. I lay there breathing deeply as a whirlwind of visions consumed my total being, I was convinced that I had somehow gone mad and was now wandering the streets naked in a crazed delirium. The I had a vision that my mum was driving back from her weekend away, frantic at the news of her dead sun. I reached out to her and assured her that everything was fine because time and space were simply illusions that we create in our minds. I tried to tell her that it didn't matter where we were we would always be together because we are all one. to me it was a beautiful thing and I wanted her to know that, to share the joyous rapture of it.
