Having been driven psychotic watching my ego so brutally and quickly turned to a puddle of proverbial shit, I again retreated to my bed. This time, however, it was a decision based purely in instinct, with no conscious thought attached to it whatsoever. My ego was in its death throes, and I was completely overwhelmed by the paradoxical nature of my situation. On the one hand, everything seemed crystal clear; I was still very much in control of my physical actions and had a great deal of restraint and discretion. On the other hand, I felt as though I had gone completely insane and as though some unnamed third party was controlling the freakshow kaliedoscope that had become my thoughts. Tossing and turning, thinking about both everything and nothing at once, my ego finally gave way and collapsed in what was to be the peak of my experience.
