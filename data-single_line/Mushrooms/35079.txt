Images were shooting by me at lightening speed, the most bizarrre imagery you could imagine. Aliens committing strange pseudo-sexual acts on each other, more and more technology, technology that as it evolved melded more and more with these beings, and they became one with all the matter around them. It felt like they were grabbing me by the arms and yelling at me. I could feel them pulling me one way and another, as they desperately beamed this information to me faster and faster, more and more intensely. I couldn't take it, I thought for sure I've gone insane, I've completely blown my mind, I'm never coming back from this.
