This experience changed my life in innumerable ways. I had never felt such a connection with my surroundings and nature. The place spoke to me of a time long forgotten, and showed me it's beauty beyond anything i had ever seen before. So for those of you looking to learn from mushrooms, I would have to say that they are the greatest teacher that I have come into contact with. I hope to try some other entheogens, but i will never forget this experience that changed my life.
