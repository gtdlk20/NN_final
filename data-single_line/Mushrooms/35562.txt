Then, I looked upwards, and saw before me a figure around 10 metres tall, broad and heavy-set, arms crossed, with large bull-horns sticking sidewards out of it's shoulders, and out of it's head like a demon.  It stood over me, but was silhouetted, so I could not make out any other features.  It just stood there, arms folded, staring at me.  I have never felt so afraid as I did at that time.  I thought I was going to be eradicated from existence.  I don't know how to describe the fear.  I've almost been hit by vehicles, stared at their lights, and that wasn't as scary.  I've been attacked by a gang, one of whom had a knife, that wasn't as scary.  This was absolutely terrifying.
