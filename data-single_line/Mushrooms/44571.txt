Well first off I have taken shrooms and acid a couple of times but there were semi dissapointing experiences.  I felt the drugs very strongly but when it came to visuals for some reason I had none to a few.  The two days ago a buddy of mine got hold of an ounce of supposedly really good shrooms.  There was nothing going on and my girlfriend was gonna stay over, so she could be my sitter. So I decided to take a half-eighth plus (some extra caps so maybe I could finally see some visuals).  About a half an hour after I took them I don't know why but I tweaked I felt like I was goona have a really bad trip, so I gagged myself, I couldn't get much up though, which ended up being a good thing.  Then another half an hour (t+1:00) I started hallucinating, I dunno why this time was different maybe because of the Celexa I've been taking.  My carpet looked like a majic eye, like waves in an ocean.  Soon after I was full blown tripping.  Everything I have ever hear or read about was happining.  I saw colors everywhere and everthing had a 'mushroom like' brown feel.  The T.V. in the backroung started slowing down it's speech, intense!
