Throughout the years I have deducted that the mushroom has spread across the Universe and it has been trying to get out.  Its tactic is to reduce itself to the minimal amount of bits of information in an ultimate compression algorithm and then to squeeze through the singularity at the end and beginning of time to pop out and recompile itself again.  Just like a higher dimensional birth.  The mushroom doesnt seem to understand our facility of Will and creativity, of Love and Grace.  That could just be me projecting but it appears to be a logical, dualistic left brain entity whereas we have opted for a different evolutionary tactic combining left brain and right brain: logic and creativity, calculation and magic, all in one.  Through Meaning we open up portals but Meaning is an elusive concept  it is not a button one presses, it is a perfect combination of symbol and intuition, of the physical and the dreamt.  The mushroom is intrigued by this and hopes to use our understanding to escape together.
