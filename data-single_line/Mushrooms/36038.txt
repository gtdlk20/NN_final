Our trip-sitter told us that if we wanted to see the oracle, we first had to go through a cave and be reborn. I am normally very claustrophobic, but I wasn't afraid at this point. So we climbed down into this cave and slithered through it. There was a very narrow section when we had to let all the air out of our lungs to get through, but I still wasn't afraid. Finally, we had to rock-climb out the other side and we were reborn. it was a very intense experience to have while on mushrooms. Finally, he told us we were ready to see the oracle.
