The next few visuals I experienced were all lovely and beautiful to the psychedelic mind. All of the repeated patterns started emerging in the shapes of everything around me. The fractals were more evident and prevalent in everything than ever before. Also, the visual patterns of the long grass we were sitting in and the pine needles all around would often warp my vision into very mechanical perfect zigzags. The sense of aesthetic perfection in everything kept rising until I began to see symmetry everywhere, from our faces, to the trees, and even the sky. Looking at the sky triggered an overwhelming sense of wonder and oneness, and for a time it seemed that all the clouds had been cut as if from the same cookie cutter. I began to truly believe that M.C. Escher himself were a god or higher being, and that he was actively painting us on his canvas right then, in one of his perfect tessellations. This lasted for a time, until the constant change took over again, and lying helplessly and rapturously  on my back with Camille in the grass, I saw other patterns; more symmetry, faces and shapes emerging from the clouds, and mirrored effects like the sky was a giant kaleidoscope.
