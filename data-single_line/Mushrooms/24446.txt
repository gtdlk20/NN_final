Chris mentioned the clutter on the floor and it became a tiny city environment. We all put our heads to the floor and explored the juice cartons, plates, boxes, magazines and musical instruments as if we were tiny, inch high, people. The room really was a playground and we were tiny children seeing it all for the first time.
