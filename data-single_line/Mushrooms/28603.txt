We are wasting too much time.  Entertainment is fine, but I think we need to start directing our lives better.  We are drifting and wasting too much of our life in mindless things that arenÂ’t really making us happy when the day is done.  Set a reminder on the phone to go off every hour and FORCE yourself to look at the list, pay attention to everything on the list.  Give it your undivided attention, and remind yourself on an hourly basis what your goals really are.
