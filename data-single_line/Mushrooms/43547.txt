Everyone was messing around building the fire untill about 6:30PM. That's when Pete and I looked right at each other and then back at the other three who were still scurrying around gathering wood. I could feel my chest tightening and my pulse increased. I felt the jitters and Pete was talking really fast to me. I knew I had dosed myself heavily (I usually obtain pretty fierce visuals and some insanity from 3.5 grams), but the onset of the trip still was taking a while to set in.
