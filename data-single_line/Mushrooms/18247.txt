There was only one local left, a 27ish woman on the other side of the ledge.  She appeared to be waiting for her boyfriend, who was swimming.  We talked about her cursorily because she looked at us very long and weird, like she knew something was wrong with the picture, but didn't know what and didn't care to ask.  We all told each other what we had seen, and I was talking about the ledge turning into a frog, and the vipor rock.  I began to feel very megalomaniacal, like I was in control suddenly.  I said 'my mind can do anything right now!'  Clock told me to move the bridge that we could see down the river.  I couldn't do it right away, but sure enough the next time I looked at it, it was stretching towards me.
