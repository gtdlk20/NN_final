I entered the museum, walked around for about 20-30 mins, at which point I began to feel the first effects of the shrooms, a sort of slightly apprehensive state of mind, butterflies in my stomach (not nausea - the sensation was pleasant), and feeling as though I had grown slightly taller, or was slightly off-balance. These effects gradually intensified, and I began to feel fuzzy in the head, which was annoying. This was the only adverse effect of the experience, and it dissappeared after about an hour. As the fuzzy-headed effect waned, I became VERY euphoric, and the off-balance sensation intensified to the point where I felt as though I was dancing every time I moved. It was quite pleasant. In addition, my arm stopped hurting, and the cast, previously an annoying, itchy encumbrance, became much more comfortable. It is interesting to note that even after I came down, the cast remained comfortable.
