There is a period of time here that I lost.  I don't know how to explain it except in contrast to how I felt when I snapped out of it: When I sat up what felt like an eternity after laying down on my bed (though it was probably not very long at all) it was as though I suddenly remembered who I was and where I was, and yes, I had in fact taken acid earlier.  The period of time in which I was laying down was one without thought, not even comprehending everything that I was seeing, hearing, and feeling.  The one solid memory I have of the experience was the poster beside my bed, a Klaxons poster to match the music.  The poster is set up like a collage and all the pieces of it were moving around each other in a fluid and slightly disorienting manner.
