After about 15 min I felt increased social confidence, more interest in chatting with some people I didn't know that well, and an increased feeling of well-being.  At about the one-hour mark I decided to make my way back to my camp and chill for a bit by myself.  I started to feel happy and thankful to be where I was in the moment, noticing details of my surroundings, the beauty of nature and appreciating the creativity and energy of the other humans around me.  I felt more confidence to say hello to strangers and interact with people.  Back at camp, I felt my energy increase significantly, my heart rate increased and I was noticing patterns in the trees, the sounds of cicadas and birds, and the laughter and singing of people camped around me.  It was beautiful!  I felt thankful and appreciative.  I did a short yoga practice, really feeling and noticing the small details of how my body felt at the time, which muscles needed to be stretched or flexed, and which positions would be beneficial.
