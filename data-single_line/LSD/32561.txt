The first time I tripped was with 3 of my close friends and we all took one hit. This particular blotter acid was a (spider-man) and, obviously had a little picture of the face of spider-man on it. This was a wonderful experience and I felt a sense of closeness to my friends, and it was during the day, cause we had skipped school, and the sky was so big, BLUE, and beautiful. We walked through the woods for a hour just looking at plants and picking flowers and buds off different plants and bushes; I felt a real respect for the beauty and naturalness of nature. Then we came up on a railroad track, and it just so happened that a train came by at that time, and it was loud as hell. And I could feel the ground shaking.  But this isn't the bad experience.
