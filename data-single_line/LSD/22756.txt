I recall what a friend of mine had advised me to do if I take LSD. He suggested I lock myself in a bathroom and turn out the lights, promising me that I would be transported. I follow his advice. Hes right, as soon as the lights go out, the bathroom walls jettison away and I find myself on a vast, cold, empty plane surrounded by robots breathing heavily in my ears. Spirals and waves of spheres and colors fly around my vision, and I can make out prehistoric creatures roaming about in the distance. I emerge from the bathroom minutes later in a state of profound awe. I urge my friends to try what Ive just experienced. They do, and theyre all amazed.
