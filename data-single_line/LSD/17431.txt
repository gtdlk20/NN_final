I looked at P. His face had become a complex interplay of pinks and whites, and an explosion of perceptions and associations of him flooded my mind.  He turned towards me with a depth of sincerity and happiness in his face that people on entheogens, and in zen consciousness tend to have.  I was startled that through his face, i simultaneously saw the universe and a total void.  We talked for the rest of the walk, though I forgot the gist of it.  As we reached the cafe, i pointed out that after only about half an hour I was already higher than at any time in my life, and that we'd be soaring to uncharted heights.  The most acid i'd done prior to that was 6 blotter hits and he'd done no more than 4 or 5 at once.  P. changed dramatically from innocently open and loving life to stricken with terror. He complained a bit, but I talked him down somewhat. I didn't realize I had a harmonious 'flow' of well-being up to that point until P. disrupted it on the surface level like rain on a pond.
