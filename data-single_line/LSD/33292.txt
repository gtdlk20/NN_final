We then went back to the dorm, because my mdma taking friends were coming down hard, and so we all sat in the dark listening to pink floyd dark side of the moon. I had some great closed eye visuals here, the visuals just played around the song and held relevancy in them, one part i remember was watching rainbow dollar and pound signs fly by me as the song 'Money' was playing. It was fantastic. Another point i remember was listening to my friends in the bed furthest from me (They are a couple) giggling and laughing with each other, only to realise that it was just the drum beat of the song, and tha id interpreted that in my head that it was the two of them chatting. It just reminded me of how powerfully mind bending LSD is.
