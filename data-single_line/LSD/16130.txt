This place was really strange. The patterns, and shapes were plentiful and had made for quite a visually fantastic spectical.  The workers, and the owner which we had known from the many times we had visited before, had looked like complete circus animals. Their smiles widened and intensified with every movement, and made me uncomfortable. I kept convincing myself of the drugs powerful stimulation and that I could handle this powerful batch of acid. Even though I wasn't hungry, nor was Matt, we ordered mozarella sticks and water. The water tasted like straight pool chemicals, and made me sick to my stomach. I tried my hardest to keep the sick feeling out of my mind, but it persisted for many minutes. I calmed the feeling with a few bites of the mozarella sticks, but then shortly after realized that the cheesy sticks had been another bad decision. I felt even more sick now than ever, and it took my every inch of strength to hold back a sickening display in front of the employees. Matt had been answering most of my questions with other questions and seemed very distant from my focus but I paid no mind until these next events.
