(5:30-6:00 since we took it) Once arriving at the checkpoint we previously stopped at on the way over here, S spotted the lizard I saw earlier. It easily could have been a different one but it was cool to see one in the same exact spot as earlier. I later figured out that they are called Basilisk Lizards. As we neared my house, S exclaimed, We didnt listen to Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds! So I pulled up the song on my phone and we began to listen to it. We were practically drenched in sweat, wearing dorky bike helmets, and could barely hear the song due to the loud screeching of my bike. Its like the ending of a really bad movie, S said. I started laughing uncontrollably. Even though we were coming down from our trip, it was definitely one of the funniest moments of the day.
