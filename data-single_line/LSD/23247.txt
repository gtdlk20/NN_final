Around this time I called my friend to notify him that IÂ’d taken my share. He told me that if I was having fun it'd be OK if I had his one too. WOW, what a great friend! At around T+2.00 I dropped the second hit. My trip for the first few hours was really fun. I didn't know what to expect but I remember laughing and giggling a lot. I was really having fun.
