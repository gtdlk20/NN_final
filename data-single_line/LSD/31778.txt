So to the day of the trip. It was a sunday morning and I woke up at 9 a.m. and went to have some breakfast. I made myself a huge plate, thinking I wasnt going to eat for the next 10 hours or so. I tried to keep myself calm, but I couldnt get rid of the thought that I was going to have a bad trip, like last time. I sat down beside Vs roommate, too nervous to even say hello. After a while I blurted out a beautiful day, huh?. Vs roommate looked at me and said why the fuck do you care, are you going fucking skiing or something? He had no idea.
