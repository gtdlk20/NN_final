Yes, it was more intense. Things seemed to move much faster than on shrooms. I ended up having sex on acid. This was something that was not planned! I saw stars, tons of them, beautiful stars,slightly deformed stars--- and the scenery was always immaculate. I studied everything, because there was so much demention, and it didn't have any similar hallucinations to shrooms. This was an individualized drug, I must say. Completely unexpected. I remember looking at a Kurt Cobain poster. Kurt was winking, smiling and even slightly flirting with me through his stares.I laughed at lot, this drug is so beautiful, I seemed to be seeing chinese dragons in trees and such, it was SO beautiful. Everything was.
