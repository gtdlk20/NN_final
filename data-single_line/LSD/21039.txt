The dancing was phenomenal.  The song that best sticks out in my mind is Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen.  The climax of the song is one of the climaxes of my life.     The theme of the prom was Cinderella; so naturally, trippy, fairy tale Disney music was played throughout the ballroom.  While slow dancing with my date to a Disney song (with birds chirping, tin whistles, and the like), the room changed colors from red, to yellow, to purple.  It was a very euphoric and colorful experience, and caused me to giggle and smile a lot.
