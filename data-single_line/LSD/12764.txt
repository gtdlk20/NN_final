Suddenly I was outside, I don't remember getting up at all, just sitting on the porch outside.  The whole thing was like a dream, like nothing I'd ever experienced in trips before.  I was completely disoriented, lost in my mind, hearing people talking but not sure what was going on. I'd piece together things they'd say, but never was really aware of the conversation as a whole.  Someone said something about sneaking to a car and I become paranoid, thinking we were hiding from someone.  I heard the word 'acid' and suddenly remembered that I'd taken acid. A couple seconds later I forgot again, but remembered almost instantly.  The same thought ran through my head every few seconds, 'oh yeah, I took acid. Why was everything so strange? Oh yeah. I took acid. Why do I feel so funny? Oh yeah. I took acid.'  Then I realized that I was thinking the same thought and I became freaked out, stuck in a loop of perpetual realization.
