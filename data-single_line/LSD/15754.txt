I stood up and looked at the others. They seemed stoned, uncommunicative, lethargic, as if something terrible had or was about to happen. I remember walking around the living room and kitchen when my mood began to shift. No longer was I happy and energetic. Now I was feeling ill. I felt like I might suddenly explode as the pressure on my stomach and brain built. This worried me at first, then I managed to focus and realise what had to be done. I told that others that we should go for a walk. It didn't take long to convince them as I could start to see them coming up, the drug had reached their brains. Now they were as excited as I was at the prospect of wandering the streets for many hours.
