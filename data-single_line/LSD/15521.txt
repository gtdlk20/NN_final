I was amazed by the size of one dose, it really is tiny. It was a little piece of coloured paper wrapped in foil. I had also heard that it was important to keep LSD in the freezer to preserve it so this was also done. On the day I decided take the dose Id had a fairly late night the night before and was slightly hungover from drinking. I am sure this had a negative effect on the experience. I arrived home in the morning at about 10:00am and took the tab at about 10:30am along with a few toasted sandwiches and juice. I have recently heard that juice can make LSD more potent but was not aware of this at the time. This may be a rumor Im not sure, it doesnt seem to make much sense.
