I made my way to the nearby park, seeking a pleasant natural place to maybe smoke that joint. There was a lot of mucous building up in the back of my throat, and I started to cough frequently, spitting out the phlegm. Thats kind of weird, I thought to myself. I have hacked my lungs out before on high doses of 2C-I, 2C-E or 2C-B. Even on mushrooms. But usually I dont get this kind of body load on acid. Unless I am specifically tripping out about my body for some reason, acid usually has little to no body load.
