Sean and me didn't think that these little pieces of paper could do anything. So, Sean and me carelessly put our two hits in our mouths. After thirty minutes, with no effects, I started to doubt if it was even real acid. But fifteen minutes after that I felt it's first effect. I was sitting on the couch, with Sean and David, and a just started laughing and giggling. Then Sean started doing it. David just thought we were acting like fools. I specifically remember me and Sean turned upside down on the couch and started 'walking' on the ceiling. I, then, realized that we did indeed get real acid. Daniel and Kevin soon came home and we told them that we were tripping our balls off. Kevin knew some knowledge about acid and he said we would probably be tripping for the next twelve to sixteen hours. I never thought acid lasted so long. Sean and me got worried, because we both had to work the next day at ten in the morning. Daniel had a dime-size joint, so we walked outside and started smoking it. Daniel started joking around, saying 'Whoa dude, your tripping' and 'You getting any visuals'. Daniel was also acting like he was going to hit me. That was when I started to feel the anxiety and nervousness that acid gives you. Almost like you have a sense of false security.
