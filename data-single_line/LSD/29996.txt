My friends saw a bottle of my medicine sitting out and thought I overdosed on them, which I didn't. Then they dragged me out of my house and I made an ass out of myself in front of alot people on the street. My friends didn't handle the situation right at all, they were slapping me and stuff like that. Later on I ended up coming down, but still thought they were doing magic tricks and things like that. I've left out a good deal of what happened because I can't even explain it.
