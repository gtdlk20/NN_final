Acid has also made me more empathetic and given me the ability to listen to people without any pre-formed notions of what they are trying to say. Acid has also made me more empathetic and given me the ability to listen to people without any pre-formed notions of what they are trying to say. Before I became an acid user, I had a firm grip on good and evil and what was right and wrong (I thought I did). I did not realize the immensity of each and every (fully mentally functioning) human being's thought process. I felt like I was the only person who thinks all of the time and that all of my trains of logic were correct. The debasement of standards that acid gives me caused me to realize that there is a completely different reality in every human being's head. While I kind of knew this before I tripped, I realized what the implications of the idea were through acid. Behind every person's beliefs (even if the viewpoint is opposite of yours) there is a perfectly cogent and logical series of supporting facts, no one holds a belief to be true without knowing in his/her mind that it is true. I realized that I cannot change someone's mind by arguing. This also made me realize that many of the notions that I have in my head may be wrong or may be ill-based because of my biased perspective.
