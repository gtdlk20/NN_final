After sitting in one place for about 5 minutes (It seemed like hours, we even got up for almost a minute then remembered we were supposed to stay) S was able to locate us.  I'm happy we finally have found S and I ask him if he would like to ride some rides.  S seems disconnected from the world I'm in and I realize that communication is impossible.
