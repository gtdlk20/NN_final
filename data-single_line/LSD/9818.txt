After the initial 2-hour or so peak, the effects slowly but surely declined.  After about eight hours I was able to walk around outside - things were still weird, but I was outwardly coherent.  The dropoff was very slow and there was no way I could sleep that night.  At 8:00 AM, 14 hours after I took the acid, I was still strung out and had a headache without being able to sleep.  (Note: all psychedelics seem to last inordinately long for me.  Salvia often persists for half an hour to an hour, a 60 mg AMT trip lasted 23 hours, etc.)  I went to work and a hellish, headache-filled, exhausting day.  I got almost nothing done.  I got home at 5:30 PM and slept for about five hours.  I felt quite renewed afterwards and called my elderly grandmother for the first time in a long, long time; she was delighted to hear from me and we had a great conversation.
