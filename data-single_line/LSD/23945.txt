After that moment, there was a long period of time when we both kept forgetting what we were talking about.  It was a loop, we kept finding ourselves with no memory of the entire hours-long conversation.  'What were we talking about, seriously?  Something about memory... uh...?'  and then we would both laugh about how we kept forgetting about forgetting.  It was a very bizarre thing to be happening to both of us at the same time.  I've wondered if Matt was just messing with me, but now for some reason I don't believe it's true. Hopefully that'll make more sense when you're done reading.
