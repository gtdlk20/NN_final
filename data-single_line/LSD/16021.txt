I went outside to have another cigarette. I had the quintessential false feeling of sobriety, I wasnt hallucinating but something just wasnt right. I sat on a curb at the bottom of my apartment complex, To this day Im not sure if the next events actually happened. A car pulled up, its owner got out, went over to the lease office, opened the mail slot, looked inside then left, Another car did this, then another, When I predicted that the next car driving by would do the same, it did, two more times. I saw a woman walking on the street, then I would see one of the exact cars that had already passed me, pass me again. I floated home in confused stupor. While trying to sleep I suddenly felt a deep religious conviction, God was talking to me, I felt a massive sensation of guilt for all my past sins and broke into tears, After about an hour I fell asleep after twelve hours of tripping.
