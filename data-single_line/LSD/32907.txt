When we all went out the backyard to have the smoke, one of my friends commented that soon it would be the break of dawn. Only then, I realized time was split into daylight time and nighttime. I didn't even remember that! Then, my friend handed me some bread and I just stared at it. He said: Eat it! Do you know how to do it?!Â” Haha! I got a kick from it, because indeed I had forgot we human beings eat! And that reminded me that we are all animals.
