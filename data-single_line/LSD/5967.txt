So kind of a depressing walk, but in retrospect the walk was pretty nice compared to being in the mall. Malls are fucking scary! All my senses had been heightened, and I was very aware of the little details. The subtropical heat, making everyone feel a little stupefied. The toxins making the whole building malodorous. The gaunt and vacant stares of the shoppers, anxiously searching for bargains. It was scratch and save days and a lady walked past asking her kids how much they had saved on their purchases. I saved 10%! said one daughter proudly. The other moaned, I only saved a penny. All three had the same chubby, fast-food figure.
