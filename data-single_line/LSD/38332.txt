When i turned nineteen (summer of 98) i was a heavy acid user.  i had just found out that i had impregnated  my ex-girlfriend and was somewhat of an alcoholic loser.  However, we were getting really good lsd mailed from out west, and i was eating a fair bit of it.  over the course of the year i ate it about every weekend, usually 3-8 hits.  i would constantly feel someone hovering over my shoulder and whispering something in my ear.  i couldn't tell who it was but knew it was a girl. this happened approximately 5-7 times over the course of the year.
