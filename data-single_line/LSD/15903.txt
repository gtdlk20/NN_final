A few hours later, I had already had my fun with the forest so I decided to switch settings. I called my friend who we'll call T and she said I could come over to her house and chill if I wanted. I'd never been there before and when I got there, it was like heaven. She had a truly hippied out room with Jimi Hendrix posters, Woodstock and peace symbols everywhere, a cool stereo with Pink Floyd playing and all these bright colors and crazy patterns in her bed that I could've stared at for hours, and I did. At this point, I could really feel the acid and it was only going stronger. We started smoking a lot of weed and I'd never felt so high before. Every time I ripped a bowl, I would hallucinate more and more.
