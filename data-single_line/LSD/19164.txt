J and I took our hits at approximately 4:30 in the afternoon a few days later in our dorm.  I noted the blotter paper had a vaguely metallic taste.  I kept the paper on my tongue for about 20 minutes until it dissolved and I swallowed it.  After swallowing our paper J and I went downstairs where he smoked a cigarette (I don't smoke) and then we went into the store and each bought a bottle of orange juice to sip on while we waited for the effects to set in.
