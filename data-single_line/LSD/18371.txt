This was the month of November of 2018. I had a friend with whom I usually dropped acid the entire summer of that year. By September our relationship was becoming a bit patchy and by October it was not a lot immersive as it used to be. In November we met and she expressed her wish to drop some acid to cherish the last days of fall with me. That night I sent her a stern text saying that I do not want to trip out with her as I want to trip with someone more spiritually intimate. She calls and starts shouting at me and we meet that night and she convinces me to a trip outside Montreal. I arrange the trip and we agree to a date.
