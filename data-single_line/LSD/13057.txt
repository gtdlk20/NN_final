Im gonna take a break from making the recordings for a while. I realized that Im safe from having to display them, cause, Im in the other room of my laptop. And thats where I recorded the initial greeting, the introduction, so to speak. And uh, I just could not in good.good conscience, introduce something so poorly. There is already an introduction. I will leave it until I can comfortably access it. Soall of these recordings will follow that. Im gonna just try to get warm now. I feel like this sounds really way more sad than it is. It should not sound sad cause Im smiling and Ive been smiling the whole time.
