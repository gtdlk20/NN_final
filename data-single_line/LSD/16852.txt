I could feel a presence over my shoulder, not intimidating presence, but felt such a love from this being that I can really not begin to explain it in words.  It told me that it needed to show me something, and that it was the most important thing in the world and asked me if I was ready.  I said yes, and then all of these images began to flash through my mind, slow at first and then faster and faster, I would later realize this as images described in the Bible, from Adam and Eve, through the present time, history flashing so fast that I couldn't grasp all that I was seeing.
