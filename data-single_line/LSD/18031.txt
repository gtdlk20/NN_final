My most memorable lsd experience was the first time I ever done it. I had stayed at my friend Barry's house the night before and so did our friend Griff, that morning our other friends Chad and Rachael came because we was all planning on going to Barry's brothers house and hang out. A few minutes before we left we was all in Barry's room getting ready to smoke a joint and Barry's friend Sonny came in, he told him that he had liquid acid and it was $8 a hit, normally all of us would tell this man to stick his $8 acid up his ass but this is a small redneck town where you will get to come across acid once every other year so how could we refuse. everone only had enough money to get 2 hits, but after I got my 2 hits I started thinking that after this when will I get to trip again so I said I wanted 2 more.
