At some point in time I rushed to the bathroom and began to vomit. I was tripping somewhat, but it still hadn't completely taken over yet. It had to have been around 7:30 or so. I went back to my room where my friends were and laid down in my bed again. I still felt absolutely sick. I was overheated and felt weak, and my teeth were grinding against each other. My head felt like it was going with the visuals I saw, going out a thousand dimensions, and with this I got 'face chills', or some sort of chills that only occurred in what felt like the back of my head. I got up, sat down, got up, and sat down, debating on whether I should go throw up again. I didn't want to, but God, I felt so shitty. So I did. This next time around my visuals were coming in full swing. I sat in front of my 'porcelain God' and threw up. I paused and heard my friend in my room telling my boyfriend to 'focus on yourself' and for some reason I found this inspiring as I watched the vomit in my toilet. I got up, recovered myself, and went back to my room. I told C what he said was inspiring and went back to lay down. I kept gagging for quite some time and felt nauseous for another good hour, but it felt much longer.
