I had to go to the bathroom, so I asked where the bathroom was, and B told me the second stall was the ladies' room, and something about the mens room having a dart board.  Because it was a pretty normal apartment I thought he was being figurative or something, it didn't make sense to have a ladies' room.  I wandered into the apartment, but couldn't figure out where to go. I walked into a few rooms, looking for a toilet. Finally I stumbled into a room that had two toilet stalls, like in a public bathroom.  I stared at them, trying to figure out if I was in a dream...it didn't make any sense to me.  I stood for a long time staring at the bathroom. Unsure of what to do next.  My body felt strange, I wasn't sure if I actually had to pee or not, or what it felt like to have to pee or not have to pee.
