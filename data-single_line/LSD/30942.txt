Summer, then, decided to head out. I asked her, Arent you finding this paradise?, to which she just looked at me and remarked, I was like that two hours ago! with a big smile on her face. She thought she wasnt affected by the substance anymore, but I didnt believe her. I let her go, since I figured she probably wanted to be alone for a bit. Dianna and I both agreed that we needed to be warmed up a little more before leaving.
