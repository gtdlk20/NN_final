By the time we got to the car, I was truly starting to trip.  Time seemed incredibly slow, and the music playing through the car stereo took on new dimensions.  The sound seemed deeper, and the directional mixing of each song became much more distinct.  My companions decided that they were going to pick up some weed, as well as some food at the local grocery store.
