I left the cap to dissolve for around 2 hours before taking 0.6ug before heading to the event (around 18:15). While on traffic (I was not driving) (around 18:50) songs sounded in loud and amazing, had to do a full karaoke moment. Usually IÂ’m really nervous while on traffic since where I live you can get mug in that situation really easy, but I felt really calm and with no anxiety in my body. I was more focused on the singing part.
