Last year, when I was 16 years old when I did acid to trip for the first time, previous times I had did 25I-NBOME which I identified by its strong metallic and bitter taste. The only reason I know this was truly LSD was because I had got caught at school smoking and they searched me, they found the LSD tablets on me and gave them to the cops to be tested, I later discovered through the police department it was indeed LSD. Also to note I donÂ’t remember a whole lot from this trip so I apologize for the choppy sequence of events.
