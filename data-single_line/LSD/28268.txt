We played a little more frisbee until we decided that we should go somewhere else. So we got in the car ( I do not recommend doin this even though we did) and we drove up to whistler to skate the park. We were so distracted by the ppl lookin at us the 2 weirdos that we left. We wanted to smoke some more pot so we found an old loggin road and we walked along it and we looked over and there was this massive rock face and we saw like carvings in the rocks that shaped ppl and we started to believe that world was made for humans and this is wat the carvings told us. We stared at these carvings as we packed a bowl in the bong. We decided we had enough of these crazy carvings by this time it was 9 am and we thought we should find some other symptom of entertainment.
