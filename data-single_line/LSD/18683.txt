We sat down at a bench that was near the water and lit up 2 joints, which began to make everything even more vibrant.  We eventually made it onto the ground somehow and we were all staring into the sky as the clouds danced everywhere.  I distinctly remember seeing the sun glow in the corner of the sky and seem to morph and change like a huge burning ball of gas (hmm wonder why) as it moved across the sky. The fractals I was seeing as I gazed into the sky were almost like stained glass,it was just amazing.  I distinctly remember saying (in these exact words) I feel soooo weird.but not as much as I feel awesome! that basically should describe my experience ha ha.
