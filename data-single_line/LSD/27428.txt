Going back to touch base, and get swim gear on and head to the neighborhood pool. Got there and were literally sucked in (actually figuratively, but the acid made it literal) and went about our lunatic way. It was 9:00 and all dark; the stars were trailing but no true visuals yet. I could stay underwater forever, looking into a green abyss and laying stagnant a meter down. We were yelling and laughing and holy shit. This was the most Pleasure I had felt in my life, like the world was one. We had tried to get out of the water but couldn't. It was the most challenging feat, to actually step out of the pool. We were joyed when #2 actually did it to get the time. We told him to stay and help us out but he was sucked back in. This pool had power that I had never before seen.
