Even though I should have been the most frightened one there I just started laughing and making fun of my Russian friend for that and he admitted it was his mistake and he shouldnt have done that. He just thought I was mocking this private letter of his and what it said and I had to remind him that that wasnt it and I was just tripping on acid blah blah blah and he admitted he forgot I was on acid and ya I just kept making fun of him lol pointing out the fact that he tried to punch me with the bong in his hand. Eventually hes like whatever and gets up and goes to a different room to do something but in a non threatening way. More like a ehh theyre just tripping on acid type of way. I can read him pretty well. Its funny because right after he tried to punch me and tell me it was a private letter I was just laughing in his face because I thought he was joking at the time and just trying to mess with me which I think only made him more angry. I thought he was just trying to trip me out. I just kept saying Are you joking right now? Theres no way youre serious.. and hes like NO! Thats a private fucking letter. My other friend was kind of worried lol. Even after my Russian friend said whatever and got up and left the dining room my other tripping friend still looked concerned and effected by what had just happened. Meanwhile I was still making fun of my Russian friend/kind of apologizing too and then I get the urge to smoke weed so I just grab the bong and start cracking up as Im hitting it while my other tripping friend across the table is justwell..adjusting to the situation I guess you could say.
