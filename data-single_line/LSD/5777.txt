Everything was so significant that night: like every little detail of everything! I even wrote at the bottom of the back of my drawing, Everything is so significent. Magnificent? Significent. And yes it was spelled wrong. I looked at it after I wrote it and thought that it didnt look right. Is that really a word? Sig-ni-fi-sent. Like magnificent? Well everythings magnificent right now too, but what the hell is that word? I couldnt think of the correct pronunciation of the word. Oh well, maybe its not a word, maybe I just made it up in my head. Language is obsolete, and words are just useless, they dont mean as much as they are intended to mean. I was seriously convinced that significant was not a real word, and that my mind had fabricated it just like my distorted visions and crazy thoughts, and the abstract piece of art that had revealed itself to me.
