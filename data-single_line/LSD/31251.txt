The intensity of those sensations was so heightened that I had to vocally express it, like when I was back in Diannas room, slamming my fist on her roommates bed. I released my energy by spinning around, twirling down the street, delightfully exhausted. As I saw cars passing, I felt even safer seeing the world continue running, and never stopping. This was my world, and I belonged, and knowing that was all I needed to entice an overwhelming wave of happiness, that, coupled with the phazed-guitar of the song, turned off my mental intelligence completely. I began expressing that sense of comfort with very loud, strange noises. They sounded like moans of pain, the ones we make when were stressed out and need to release stress. I mean, I definitely felt all-too relaxed, if anything, but my brain was so puzzled by what was around me that I couldnt help it. I couldnt hold it in, MMMMM... AAAAAAAAAH....MMMMM!!!
