Inside was some more packaging and pack of candies in black packaging.  I opened the candies carefully and looked inside- there were 5 of them.  Check.  This was going well so far.  Next came out the blacklight.  They lit up on one side or another, not both (except for one, which my seller told me he had double dosed), so this was another confirmation.  Okay.  Now time to put them away in a really good hiding spot until I find the right time to do them.
