After snapping out of my trance if you will I was quite worried about the road the acid was taking me down.  I was aware that the trip I was having was not what I really wanted to have but just the fact that I knew I wanted to have a better trip seemed to calm me down.  What I really wanted was something normal to grab on to instead of the strangeness I had been going through and thinking about my trip as just the effects of a drug was a good start to grounding myself in reality.  J had also been having a mental trip and was for us finding a change of scenery.  My depth perception was all messed up as we walked down the hallway to the elevator, it almost seemed like the floor was slanted.
