At the 3 hour mark my partner came back to camp and I enjoyed our talk and the process of getting ready to go out for the evening's burn event.  I felt no desire to drink alcohol, smoke cannabis, drink caffeine, or change my mental state in any way.  I had energy to talk with people who came up to say hello (note- I'm usually pretty shy), and was also comfortable enforcing my boundaries when drunk or annoying people wanted to talk for longer than I was comfortable.  I generally enjoyed the evening although nothing really spectacular happened, and nothing horrible either.  It was a nice night in a surreal setting.  The main difference was that I felt very little shyness and I was more comfortable chatting with strangers and gracefully exiting situations that I did not want to be in.
