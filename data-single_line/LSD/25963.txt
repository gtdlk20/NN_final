We watched one of those psychedelic videos, and it looked so amazing. The screen showed a kaleidoscope of colors that kept morphing and morphing, and they looked razor sharp with detail. I remember being awed at how the mind could keep up with that speed. We popped in Fear and Loathing and laughed till we couldn't take it anymore. We even rewound some parts. When it was over, we watched it again with similar results. I was starving and was eating anything I could get my hands on. I ate some kind of party mix, and sugar cones, like the kind for ice cream. I found that eating very crunchy things was delightful while tripping.
