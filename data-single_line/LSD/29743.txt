Anyway, I wake up at 10:30 a.m. the day of this class, have sudden apprehensions, but take the hit almost instinctively soon thereafter.  I dressed, smoked probably 2-3 hits out of my bong, and got all my stuff ready for college feeling great that IÂ’m about to accomplish a goal I had set for myself roughly 2 years earlier.  I did not eat breakfast.  During the walk to class I felt no effects of the dose.  However, upon arriving at the lecture hall and seating myself (in the back of course) I began to feel the stomach butterflies that usually accompany the rise of any trip.  Also during this period, brush stroke-like bands of pinkish-red began to form around some things like the screen the projector projects on.  Also, my depth perception went out of wack and concentration lessened, which I had anticipated.  Also, I was having a hard time controlling laughter.  I felt crazy because I knew that no one in the class knew I was tripping at the time.  It really was a great feeling though; it was like I had a huge super secret all to myself.  I believe this secret is what led to my feeling of extreme giddiness.  Anyway, I trip very hard the entire class; time seems to drag on for a while as I attempt to concentrate, but fail in doing so.  Class lets out at 11:50 a.m.
