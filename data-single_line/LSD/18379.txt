Inside the bus we were laughing and giggling unstoppably and this is now 7 pm. I see we are getting into the city when she tells me that her hands are still cold and she canÂ’t get them to warm up. I see her hands and they were red and I got scared and quickly took her hands in my hands with the intention to warm them up. In the the next few minutes I pass out holding her hands. While passing out I feel some unusual amount of heat flowing out through my hands into her skin.
