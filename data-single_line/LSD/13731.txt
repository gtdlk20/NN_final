My set was great, attitude adjusted, I was ready to go.  We (good friend, one brother and me) had dropped 2 hits apiece around 6pm.  Within 1/2 an hour, all we had to do was look at each other to know it was time to get moving.  We bundled up (can't believe how heavy my coat is!) and went outside.  The air was so crisp and clear and clean that I could feel it, but not as an indication of cold.  Rather enlightening at the time.  We walked for about an hour(?) to a nearby park.
