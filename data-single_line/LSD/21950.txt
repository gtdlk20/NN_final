I look back at S and he hands me a cigarette and I begin to smoke it but constantly forget that I am smoking it and end up just throwing it out. I look back at A and he has since taken his shirt off and is clenching his throat saying how am I breathing? Then I would start thinking oh shit, how am I breathing? How am I alive? an overwhelming feeling that I am supposed to be doing something would take me over again and I would begin to freak out a little. A would run off for a second and then I would glance back over at S who was still cool as a cucumber and then I would calm down again. This process repeated probably 10 or more times and when I started to feel panicky I remembered how badly my nose hurt and I would grab it. The pain from my nose helped keep me grounded and calm down which might seem odd. A finally goes, guys should I jump off this edge? and we are like no dude that is an awful idea and decide that we should probably walk somewhere else.
