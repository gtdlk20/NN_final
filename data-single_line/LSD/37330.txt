5:00pm- I'm busy ripping CD's into mp3's when my attention span allows (I was soon to move overseas and wanted to bring my music on a hard drive).  We end up puttin on the Boards of Canada 'Campfire Headphase' disc, which creates an ocean of sonic space for our acid fried minds.  D is now smoking from his bong, and we are happy to join him.  We play a few games of Fireball Island (children of the 80's might know this) and Texas Hold Em'.  Although we are able to stay within the parameters of the games,  there are quite a few verbal tangents and side trips.
