During this time, my friend R and I roamed away from the pretty waterfall. We were going to freak out our friends my pretending to down a few pills of acid. After she went back to the waterfall, I did two hits of acid I happened to have with me but I didn't tell her about. When I came back to the waterfall, she kept asking if I really took some. I didn't say anything.
