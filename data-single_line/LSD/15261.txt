3am: Dimensions and time are shifting. I have no recollection of where I am or what is going on. I feel like I'm in a spacial void and I have no idea what to think. My mind is absolutely confused at this point to where I couldn't complete my thoughts. I had been texting my friends at this point explaining my trip, and them texting me to keep me some sort of comfort. I can no longer text them anymore at this point. When I open the ''New Message'' option, the screens features are shifting at rapid rates and speeds. Every time I click on one of the letters, it floats off the screen into the air in my room and fades once it hits the walls. After stumbling and pressing every number and letter possible, my home screen is just a white page with no text, options, or buttons of any sort. Time is shifting. The numbers on the face of the clock are changing rapidly, they are all going through the course of 0-9 like a slot machine. I no longer have a sense of the time because I cant even understand my clock. I'm shifting around the room and the ceiling. My bed isn't against the same wall, I'm facing a complete opposite direction each minute. My bed also has gone from being on the floor to the ceiling and now the carpet is the ceiling and the fan is beneath my feat. It is thundering and lightning outside and I can feel the soundwaves and vibrations all over my body to the core of my bones. The reverb of the thunder last several minutes and the light of lightning isn't a quick flash anymore, when it happens the brightness stays, and slowly fades minutes after.
