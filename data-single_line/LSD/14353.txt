Anyway, I got out of college freshmen year and was high for about a month and a half before a friend got some acid and wanted to trip.  I always wanted to try it so I was excited and Im pretty sure we took it the night he got it.  I put one tab in my mouth at around 8 and the next at about 9:30 maybe.  My friend took them both at about 9. Before I took the second, I was tripping about as hard as I ever had, not expecting what was going to come.  Little did I know it was some ridiculously strong acid.  As the second one hit me, I started to tweak out, and couldnt sit still.  I was coming up too fast and I was with drunk people so I went outside with my friend.  It was then that it all hit me.  It must have been about 10:30 now.  I was experiencing a level of existence I never thought possible.  For measure, anything I felt remotely close to this was when I took about 4 grams of mushrooms, smoked a gram of sour diesel(strong weed) and took a couple hits of 20x salvia.  I usually worry about focusing on something negative around this time and getting depressed which has happened a couple times on mushrooms before.  That wasnt the case seeing as though I wasnt capable of creating a thought that made sense to me.   I would look up at the stars and be right next to them looking down at the earth from outer space.  Cars in the driveway were floating around and would move as I pushed them Id like to see what that looked like to a sober person.  I loved it to say the least.  My friend was running around with me having a similar experience.
