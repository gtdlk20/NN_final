Finally im back to normal size.. We head up to the apartment and I go inside.. I don't eat the sandwich they got me I just lay on my bed.. So does my boyfriend... We aren't talking.. He keeps asking me if I'm ok... Which freaks me out because I think 'do I look like im not ok?' and he said he was just worried about me..
