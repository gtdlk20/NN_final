The shapes kept vibrating and moving around to the rhythm of the music, and I was in heaven. I was away. I was so far. They put on a real show, not too long after that. They spun, circled, and jumped at a steady and wondrously syncopated pace. It was like they were putting up a performance especially for me. They danced for me and my mind only. For the benefit of my entertainment, there I was. And there were them. Even though I thought I was the only person to see them, they didnÂ’t feel like they were part of my mind. They felt like something else. Utterly and entirely disconnected with my cervical perception. And looking for them was strenuous. Strenuous, but amazing, and well-worth the effort. Truly mind-blowing.
