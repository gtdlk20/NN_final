At this point (approx. T=2 hours) reality started to slip away totally. Normally on acid (highest doses prior to this was 5-7 drops) I have got amazingly changed perspective on the world but at the end of the day everything was still real and tangible. From this point on I was honestly not sure what part of my experience was real and tangible and which was just a construct of my mind.
