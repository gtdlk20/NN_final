On our way back through, we stopped to catch the end of two fire-dancing women, and then the belly dancers came out.  They were beautiful, seductively instructing us in just how a body could flow like water, or take on a serpentine elegance of writhing and weaving and breathing together.  After that ended, we found a giant swing set in a less populated part of the whole affair, and began swinging and kicking our legs.  When we looked up at the stars, it was insane.  The stars - the whole sky - looked as though it were being stirred with an invisible spoon, like cookie dough and the stars were the chocolate chips.  But it was far more spectacular than that - the colors were so vibrant, and the stars seemed to wrap and undulate through each other as they swirled and sashayed through the deep blue night.  It was incredible.  The air even tasted better - we were so alive, all of our senses turned on to 'Divine Reception.'
