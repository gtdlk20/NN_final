I looked out at the lake, and sure enough, the moon lit up everything.  The reflection of the moon on the pond was shifting and moving. We walked over to a bench and sat down. D pulled out an 'irish' pipe and a bag of pot, and lit it accordingly. I took a couple of hits, and it wasn't until about 1 minute later that the peaking effects of the LSD returned in full effect.  I noticed the colors of the leaves on the ground melt together, the intense and rapid thought process returned. It took me by surprise, for part of the reason I wanted to smoke was that I suspected the LSD was wearing off.  I was mistaken however, because now I realize that they effects hadn't wore off at all, as if I was still on the trip's plateau.  I was only getting used to effects of the LSD... becoming accustommed to the moving surfaces and not thinking of it as abnormal.  I recognized how this could potentionally permanently damage my thinking process, and paid more attention to the psychadelia.
