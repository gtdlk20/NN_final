Me and C have now made it back to the sidewalk and we sit down at a bench.  I am way messed up now and the acid is still getting more and more intense.  I wonder how C is doing because he took a hit more than me.  We decide that I should lead until we find S.  I try to call S and when I talk to him he sounds very confused and can't tell me where he is.  I hang up because I'm frustrated.  We try to call back and he doesn't pick up so we walk back into the park.
