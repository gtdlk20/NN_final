In short, this experience actually enlightened my life by showing me to appreciate the health I have (mentally and physically) and to appreciate the boorishness of sober mindsets.  To be honest, this experience occurred about 7 months after my mom died and I did not properly grieve or accept this.  My trip has shown me that physical death is inevitable,  but you must treat your mind and your brain cells with ABSOLUTE care. This trip helped me become a more responsible person, and to stop treating substances as the "answer".
