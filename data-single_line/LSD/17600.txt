The subsequent days that I tried my sips, they were like little afterthoughts in the day. I didnt plan on them, I just realized some time during the day, oh look, theres my glass of dilute LSD, and I was psyched to take some, but with about as much concern as having a latte. The final day of my experiment, I still got an effect, which means whatever drug was left didnt suffer too much from a week of sitting out in room-temperature and ambient light.
