I realized that even though my parents and I had our differences of opinions on politics and religion and other related things  differences that had definitely strained our relationships  they really did mean well. They really did love me. And while I'd never FELT that love in such a strong way as I did in that moment, their love for me as their son was just as strong; if anything, my parents struggling with their own issues and still having love for me despite our differences, were all the more commendable.
