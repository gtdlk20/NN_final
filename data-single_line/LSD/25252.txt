We arrived at the destination around 2:30, half way through the 5th hour of the trip. I was starting to come down at that stage or grow more numb as I like to say and just did. My mate just wanted to chillout with music and his tranquil state. I on the other hand, was in a deep struggle with my brain for some sense of mellowness, which since following the fading eye Id been at a loss to find. It was at this point that I regained my connection with my eyes I suppose, and I started to create evil, blackened images around the room. Even though I was sliding off the timeless merry-go-round LSD provides, I was still aware of intense visual distortion. My vision then suddenly felt as if it were splintering into a numberless amount of different dimensions, or states of consciousness.
