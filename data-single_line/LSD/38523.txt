This is where it gets weird... I come to discover that me and my friend are of the same genetically evolved species, except I'm the active component and he's the passive component. He had mastered the trip from the past up the the present and I knew the trip from the present into the future. Anyways we finally succeed in smoking pot and I am suddenly absorbed in what I swore was post-terrestrial existence.
