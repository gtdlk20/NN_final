I practice yoga and meditation every once in a while, I belive I am in good physical condition and I eat well, I have experience with MDMA, cocaine, ketamine, speed paste, LSD, mushrooms ;), and some research cuemicals that were sold as MDMA and LSD although I don't do coke any more nor will I for the rest of my life as I realised it's absolute crap and I don't really get what I'm paying for and yes I've had good coke.
