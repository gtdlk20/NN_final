The outro began, the part where I do back up vocals.  As I shouted my back up lyrics I felt a strange sensation.  Love was coming out of my chest and filling the room.  It wasn't just from me, I could feel the love coming out of Guitar and Singer's chests as well.  I could even feel it from Drums.  The weapon wasn't sent from the future, it wasn't kept in the music room, and it couldn't be stolen by evil.
