At his house we took two tabs each and waited for the effects to kick in. Being the impatient mug I am I decided to take 4 more and to my suprise nothing happened. Waiting a further two hours still nothing happened. Getting frustrated I took a further two and supplied my mate with another 3. At this point nothing out of the ordinary was happening at all, so I decided to go outside for a cigarette. As I was smoking it I looked up at the door infront of me and a kaleidoscope of colours streamed through the window, all the colours of the spectrum. I thought my mate was playing a trick on me to wind me up. In my mind the tabs were duds and he had aquired a disco light. Then all of a sudden the door started petruding, falling back and melting. The glass bowed and distorted forming patterns as it did it. I thought to myself what the f**k have I just done, I've taken ten tabs of some really dodgey stuff. A third scared, a third curious and a third excited I proceeded to tell my mate that I was tripping my balls off. I looked at him and in a flash he turned into the devil then in another flash into dracula. Then back to normality. I thought it was so damn cool lol. We looked at the tv, previously playing a racing game and set on pause the tv began to reveal crypted information. We both saw a skull with a  cowboy hat, a monkey smoking a joint and a turtle moving about the bottom of the screen and lots of trees swaying about. This really started to excite us as it was just so bizzare, I've had mass hallucinations before but nothing that similar. Its almost as if our minds were on the same wavelength and we were transmitting our thoughts into eachother. I focused on the screen and eyes proceeded to fly out of it, then a white light filled my vision and then disapated. The trip had started.
