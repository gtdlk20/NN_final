Everyone crashes at dawn.  Beautiful sunrise, -I- felt like a new day.  I lay in my bed and think it is the most comfortable thing.  The apartment is dead silent, I sit there for a while with my eyes closed enjoying shapes, and cartoon characters. I have auditory hallucinations, I hear whispers, music, and just weird things.  I eventually drift off into sleep.  I got up around 1pm and felt pretty drained.  I also felt like the acid did not totally wear off until the next day.
