Instead of 'me' being trapped inside heavy folds of brain tissue, my brain was laid out before me like the keys of a vast piano. My room was my brain. And my body was also my brain. Through the cells in my body I could feel the thoughts in my head and orchestrate the vision 'in my room', because the room was also in my head. I could also see my thoughts in the room, as if they were located in various places in my brain.
