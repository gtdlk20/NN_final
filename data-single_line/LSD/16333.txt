The most difficult part for me to type was '7-11'; finding the numbers and the dash was not easy, and required a lot of concentration. So BECAUSE they required so much concentration, I distincly remembered typing them--or did I? When I looked up to read my message to check it for typos (yes, even in that state), what I saw was, 'tripping the shelves were stretching out of control.' To be sure of what was there, I had my roommate read it out loud to me. Yup. I had been concentrating so hard on getting those numbers and that dash right that I had--you guessed it--only done it in my head. But I'd thought that I'd really done it. And that tiny moment, the confabulation of having typed that simple little phrase, innocuous as it may seem, is the only time I've ever actually become disconnected from reality when under the influence of any drug.
