I still couldnt get the trip off my mind, but I wasnt so worried about it anymore after talking to R and listening to the music.  I laid in my bed and started watching some movie on TV and got really comfortable.  I must of laid there for a few hours because I remember looking at the time again and it was around 4.  I went back to my computer to check and see if anyone had tried to contact me.  But no one had.  I went straight back to bed and started watching a different movie.  My head though was still on constant thought of the trip.  Shortly though I was able to fall asleep.  Although I didnt sleep for very long.  I woke up around 9 in the morning.  My parents thought it was odd I was up so early considering I usually sleep until around noon.  I told them that I must of been just getting used to waking up early throughout the week.  When I woke though I was still hallucinating.  But for the most part the thoughts of the trip were completely erased from my mind.
