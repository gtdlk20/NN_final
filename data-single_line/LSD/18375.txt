Of all the trips I had so far I have come to notice a few quirks and features surrounding me. I have observed that I start to understand that I am tripping when suddenly my teeth and gum become extremely sensitive. I have observed that I start to understand that I am tripping when suddenly my teeth and gum become extremely sensitive. When I breathe in the air makes my teeth shiver and my gums experience a tingling sensation. This phenomenon I have come to associate with death. Why you may ask? Just weeks prior my beloved grandmothers death in 2012, I saw a dream in which I saw that all of my teeth were falling into the sink and I cant stop it from happening. My gums felt exactly that sensation in the dream. In 2012 I had no experience doing LSD or any other kind of psychedelics except for smoking up weed.
