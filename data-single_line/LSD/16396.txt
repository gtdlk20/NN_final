I went to the other room to see our rabbit which was there in its cage and he seemed to notice that I wasn't quite sober. He had been very shy before, even though I have had him for over 6 years but now when I opened his cage he jumped out of the it and came looking & sniffing me like I was somebody totally new. It seemed perfectly clear that animals have feelings and are very sensitive, and just like us humans, they think as well, not on the abstract level but they have a consciousness which isn't so open than ours and thinks more on a survival level and isn't able to invent complex inventions.
