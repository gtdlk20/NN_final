This feeling went on for probably another 15 minutes before I began to experience more powerful hallucinations. I could no longer play madden as the floor kept distracting me with it's movement, patterns, etc. At this point I bid the only guy still awake goodnight and went back to my apartment. Upon entering the hall I saw an array of rainbows being cast from the hall lights and clearly remembering saying to myself, 'This fucking rocks!'. I believe I may have stayed in the hall staring at the pretties for quite awhile though I'm not sure. I went into my apartment feeling just a little bit nervous about tripping for my first time alone. However I felt confident in my ability to keep myself level and began to play guitar. Or attempt to play guitar. I found my fingers reacted very sluggishly and could play nothing even remotely complex. After giving this up with some reluctance *I REALLY wanted to play, had some great ideas just couldn't get 'em out* I caught sight of myself in the mirror. Things were a little bit wierd here as I was able to change the way my face looked by consentrating on it. I made the images of an old man, satan and an alien appear. I noticed also a hypersensitivity to my appearence. I noticed every pore, every whisker, every fault with my face. I remember thinking to myself that I should never break up w/my girl because I'm an ugly fuck and how the hell could she stand sleeping with me? This caused me to want to shave. >8D I found this difficult because I kept getting distracted by shit. I then took a shower and the tactile sensations of the water hitting me became very unbearable. I also spooked myself a bit when I caught my reflection in the faucet.
