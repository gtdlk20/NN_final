After what seemed like an eternity sat waiting for our bus to depart we were on the road. The bus ride itself didnt seem especially weird, in hindsight I remember noticing quite a lot of trippy patterns and visual distortions but at the time they really didnt seem to matter at all. I think the time dilation must only come on really strongly when you stay in one environment for a while, because I spent the bus journey staring out of the window at the different streets and we were at the bar in no time. Id been there two or three times previously so it was an environment I was fairly familiar with. When we entered we unexpectedly bumped into two kids I know from college (C and J, for convenience) so we pulled up chairs and sat with them whilst the band played.
