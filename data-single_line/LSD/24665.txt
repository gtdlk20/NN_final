I awoke the next day with a startlingly clear memory of my version of the events of the night, yet when my friends told me what really happened, it was as if I already knew what they were going to say, but didnt know why. After a day or two of contemplation I managed to put the stories together and got what you just read. Altogether I learned to greatly appreciate and respect LSD. I learned that it will do with my mind whatever it wants to. Respect acid. Dont get sloppy with it, or it will rule you.
