About 1 and a half hours had past when I decided to take the other blotter because nothing was happeneing. We then went to this guys house and watched skate videos and played tony hawks skateboarding, both of which proved less than entertaining, especially since I was supposed to be getting messed. We went to smoke a join which I had rolled (it was very difficult although I was not very high yet) The joint got me baked but nothing else. All I felt was a feeling like I was lighter when I walked, I kind of bobbed when I walked as well. Also I felt kind of shitty too, a kind of uncomfortable feeling. We got back to the guys house after smoking the joint and watched more skate videos and still I had nothing but the junky feeling. All I noticed before I left was that the lights were really twinkly. I had to pee before I left so I went to the bathroom. I looked in the mirror. 'oh shit!' I said. I looked very very fucked. I almost looked like a girl. I had a twinkle in my eye and my hair looked like it had a female flair. I thought this was strange because when I am on mush I fall in love with myself in the mirror for long periods of time. I put this aside as me and my friends left the guys house. As we were driving home the clouds looked as though they were dancing, which was kind of cool but still nothing too spectacular.
