	Even though we as a group could not scrape together much more than the sentiment of What are we doing? we had decided to take a second exodus outside. Which may or may not have been a good idea- J was headed in a downward spiral. He had fallen very quiet, and I had noticed that he had put his right hand on his face, and had not moved it for perhaps an hour (and he would not move it for the rest of the night). On our long and confusing journey, he would often ask us to slow down, or remark that he was unable to get a hold on which dimension his existence was in. We couldnt help, seeing as the only thing we could say was What are we doing?
