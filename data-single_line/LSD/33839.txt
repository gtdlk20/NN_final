Finally, one of my neighbors let me back in the gate and I went in my apartment once more. I was glad to be back. I wasn't going to leave again. It was a bad idea in the first place, especially since I was alone. I put on some music, this time a progressive trance mixtape by a DJ named Brad called 'Mother Earth Sound System' (very good trip music I would say.) I kept getting these dehydration type feelings so I drank a big glass of water and felt good instantly. Every cell in my body celebrating my ingestion of good old H2O.
