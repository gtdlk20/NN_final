I was clinically diagnosed with Bipolar disorder about 2 months before I had tried acid the first time, and was fearful since I was taking MAOI's, but curiosity got the best of me. My first acid trip was off of one blotter square, and I didn't really think that I was tripping. This was average acid [my experienced friends who took the same stuff said so], but I didn't get any large scale hallucinations, just saw a wave or two on the floor. I noticed that my thought process was a little different. It let me observe my actions and the actions/reactions of others from many different perspectives. This mild trip led me to trying it again.
