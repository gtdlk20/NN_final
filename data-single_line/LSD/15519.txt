Recently a friend of mine, who I do not see that often anymore, announced that he could get LSD. Of recent times he has been right into experimenting with many new drugs other than alcohol and marijuana, due to this he had acquired a lot of new contacts and now knew of someone who could get him LSD. Naturally when I heard this news I was very keen to get some, as I have always been particularly interested in the psychedelic side of drugs. Anyway I purchased one blotter tab of him for $20AU, to me this seemed fairly expensive. But never having purchased it before I didnt really know what to expect and it wasnt much money to try something new that I had been wanting to try.
