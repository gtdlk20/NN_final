For a change scene we migrated into one of the other rooms. It was small and had no working lights, and a bed. The others got up and stood on the bed and started laughing and walking around on the bed, then left the room. I had to give this a try. By this time I was tripping balls and the world had become a complete symphony which I had become completely immersed in, it was awesome. Getting up on the bed I stood there, and couldnt not see what all the fuse was about, then as I walked around, it felt like a water bed, I stared to sink into it laughing my arse off. I got off the bed and proceeded to look out the window and I began to hallucinate. I saw this army guy swinging in a tree just outside the window dressed in full military fatigue with a gun, and some other really cool shit. I called the other two back in to have a look, but they failed to see anything. For some reason they werent trip as hard as me.
