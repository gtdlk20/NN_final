For awhile longer we watched more videos, talked, looked at the walls, Summer poured me some Pepsi and paused for a second mid-pour (for her she said that pause felt like minutes), I had a moment where I was unsure where my body ended and where it began, and we just enjoyed everything. After that there was another trip to the bathroom. At this point we were just about to reach the peak and were really beginning to experience the visuals as they were becoming very noticeable even without having to focus on any one thing. For example the wall in the front bathroom of our condo is so good for this drug lol. It breathes, and swirls, and changes shape all around you; it seems as if the bathroom itself seems to breath. Also note these bathroom trips probably happened every hour from now until the end of the trip, so IÂ’ll stop mentioning them. But realize this regularness, bathroom breaks every hour, maybe contributed to some of the mental looping we found ourselves in later. A reality that repeats in regular ways, like going to the bathroom every hour, can get me thinking in loops. Sadly though we did one bad thing when we went to the bathroom this time, we left the door open to the office when we were gone and our cat JoJo managed to get inside without us realizing.
