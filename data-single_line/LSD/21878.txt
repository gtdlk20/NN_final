We walked back to the truck.  Condensation had gathered on the windows and the streetlights shining through made for some interesting visuals.  We reminded ourselves of all the things that make us up; nicknames, interests, thoughts, experiences.  A strange thing to have to do, but not necessarily bad.  It canÂ’t hurt to know yourself a little better.  We also started to recall some of the earlier moments, and I came to the conclusion that this was an 8th circuit experience. We transcended the need for a physical body, and because consciousness as a collective.  In essence, we forgot so much that we remembered everything.
