Once outside, I was dead set on getting home and laying in bed. I had the fear, badly. I practically ran to my house, which was only a few minutes away, avoiding eye contact with the terrible monsters that I saw on my way home. When I got my key out of my pocket, I was flabbergasted to find it was six feet long. 'How the fuck did I get THAT in my pocket?' I wondered, before trying to knock down the door with it. Once inside, I began to relax, I was out of danger. I sat down on the sofa and took a breath, before noticing something move out of the corner of my eyes. Some people were having sex on the floor! 'What the FUCK!!!' I leaped up and noticed that not only were there two people on the floor over there fucking like rabbits, the sofa had morphed into people going at it too!!! In a matter of seconds the room was filled with people writhing around on each other. I ran upstairs to my room, but there were people copulating in there too, so I wrapped my duvet around my head. Unfortunately I could still see the people. I have never felt a terror like this, before or since. I didn't know who I was, where I was, what was happening or if it was ever going to stop. Amazingly, I managed to phone a close friend who was sober, and she came and rescued me.
