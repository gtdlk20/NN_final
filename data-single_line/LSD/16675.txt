I went downstairs to my friend's room to see if he was there and stopped on the way to stare at the gloss coating of the cement in the stairwell as it flowed like water, carrying footprints with it.  My friend wasn't there, and when I got back Jess was excited to see me.  We sat and stared at things for a while until I decided to weigh out an ounce of mushrooms to bring along for my friends. This took a very long time but I eventually finished and put them in a camera case with a box of baggies, some syrian rue, and my digital scale.
