We all decided to go to this cave up above Greg's house, it was in the middle of a large feild, the guy who owned it had cows, sheep, horses all kinds of stuff, it was a farm basically. On our way to the cave I had to slow down and catch my breathe because it was hot and I felt like I was going to pass out, The sun was so bright, it was a bright orange, and at one point it felt as if I was standing on the sun. I looked down at the ground and I noticed neon blue Greatful Dead Bears being flashed in front of me as if it was done with a laser pointer.
