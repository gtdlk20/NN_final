I believed that one of these two things could be happening and that my choosing the correct path back to the town in which my car was parked was connected with my returning to my reality. Believe it or not, I followed the roads that seemed more lighted, even after I had left the residential areas and there were no street lights. I followed the path that occured to me first. I decided that I would simply walk until I came down, and ask directions then. Or if I got lucky and got home, so be it.
