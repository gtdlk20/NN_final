Luckily, the band changed songs and this snapped me out of that particular bad spell. Wow, this stuff was SO reactive to my environment. I saw M sitting there, just like me, same position, and this really comforted me. I thought, 'why would anybody be staring at me at a festival like this, c'mon!'  This worked. I sat and soaked up the music. They ended with Sugar Magnolia and I was oh so happy, if not a little shook up. I also noticed that my jaw had been clenched all night. ouch. The paranoia, although very very slight, came back upon exiting the venue, but I was pretty much fine.
