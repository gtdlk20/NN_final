T: 1:30 Halfway through a Sigur Ros song, I had to lift the eye shades and take off the headphones.  I remember saying that this was way too much music to absorb.  The room felt like it was undulating and I was a little nauseous.  I told W that I didnt want to be responsible for the music and asked him to take over.  What I really was saying was, I dont think I am in control anymore, and wanted him to take over.  I laid down on the couch.
