Again and again throughout the night I felt myself thinking, well that is an amazing thought, but theres absolutely no way I am ever going to remember it. I better just enjoy it while it lasts at let it go. This seemed to me the attitude that I should be taking toward every moment in life, and maybe it actually is. I have thought this many times before, on many different levels, but I have never actually done it so intensely.
