My mind drifted off into a Tolkien book.  I could see the words written in that elegant text.  I was part of the earth and my body melted (rotted?) away and for a thousand years i was a hillside.  Then water and wind pushed away the dirt and i was flat again.  It was like i was reliving that part of the earth's memory.
