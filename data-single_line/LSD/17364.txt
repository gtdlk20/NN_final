We begin to feel the effects within an hour. The usual giddy, absolutley goofy euphoria engulfs us, everything is made into a joke somehow.  We mill around the apartment aimlessly, realizing that we have tripped in this house, with the same atmosphere, too many times.  It is becoming stale, and why did we do this anyway?  I began to feel kind of foolish and irresponsible, we did not have a purpose for this trip, we did it to get high.  We are both feeling kind of claustraphobic so we go outside to smoke cigarettes.
