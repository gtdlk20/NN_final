I think the the trip was still kicking in because things started to get even more different. I became aware of how unbeleivably small I was in the universe and felt a depression coming on due to the fact of how insignificant I was. I could feel the valves in my arteries opening and closing, and could feel the blood circulating through my whole body. I was able to look down at my chin which appeared to be stretched down to my waist, and was able to run my hand down it. I found at this point I was grinding my teeth alot and clenching my fists so hard that all the blood seemed to be squeezed out of them. At this point I wanted to go home. I threw my unopened chocolate bar and can of coke away because I didn't know what to do with them and started walking home with G. I remember walking past traffic lights which would change colour and give the entire night sky the same colour.
