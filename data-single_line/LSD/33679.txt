C asks me if I'm going to stop at a gas station soon.  I ask him why I would do that when he told me he didn't want to go to one. 'Oh I meant I did want to go to one' he replies.  I see a sign that says 'Last stop in ohio!' I tell C he's in luck. It's pretty large store for being a gas station on the side of the highway and I'm pretty impressed.  As soon as I walk in I see a coffee mug with a red bird and the word 'Ohio'.  I know that this cup has chosen me and I bring it to the checkout.  C orders a pizza and a Coffee.  I then order the coffee with the longest name and it turns out to be a delicious frappachino.
