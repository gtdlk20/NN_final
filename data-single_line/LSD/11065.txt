We decided we'd all had enough music videos and I went to use the bathroom. I walked out of my room and into a hallway of ever-changing pastel colors. My first attempt to open the bathroom door failed as the doorknob bent out of reach at the last second. I grabbed it and walked into a tile and glass funhouse. Rainbow patterns were sliding across the tile floor as paint was dripping down the door. Already I was amazed at how visual and vibrant the trip had become, and it was just over half an hour since I dropped.
