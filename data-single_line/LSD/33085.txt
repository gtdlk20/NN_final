I learned a lot of information on acid. Lots of answers to questions without thinking too hard, answers seem to roll off my head. Like art. Art was one of the most important realizations during this trip. I realized that life was created somehow, just as art is, simply created, making universal consciousness art itself. I realize that the mind is the most sincere form of art.
