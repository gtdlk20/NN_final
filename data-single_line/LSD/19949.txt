The walls and ceiling were all colorful graffiti style words going up the walls and into the ceiling and down again, so this became very interesting.  When the strobe light was out all there seemed to be was an infinite sea of stars I was easily lost in.  When the light flashed, words crawled out of the walls and onto the ceiling which in turn melted of the ceiling and back onto the walls.  Then it was dark...nothing but stars...again a flash and the words crawled all over the room in increasingly more and more undescribable fashions.  Then I noticed the ceiling fan.
