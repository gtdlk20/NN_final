I left the games room and had my first big hallucination. Everything around me took on a red color. I thought, 'hmm thats kind of neat.' as I walked down the hall to my red room. I walked in and closed the door and my King Kong doll yelled at me. But not the yell that it makes when you squeeze its hand. It made a realistic monkey noise. This scared me a little. Soon after this I decided that I wanted to listen to a cd that was downstairs. I also heard a tapping at my door. It was my cat. My cat is orange, very playful and very stupid and cute. It is the most harmless cat you have ever seen and honestly it looks so stupid and cute it makes me laugh. Well on acid, my cat turns into a demonical beast. It looked as though it had grown a mane and was a proud lion. This scared me alot so I decided to spare myself the mind fuck and went back to my room to listen to a different cd. Music wasn't really anymore intense than normal. The only difference was that every time it played a certain sound I was get kind of freaked out and every time it played another certain sound a white flash would come from nowhere.
