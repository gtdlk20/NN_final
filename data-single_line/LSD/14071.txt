T=3:05: I had a sudden flash of connection to ancient ancestors.  Perhaps it was taking the shirt off; I'm not sure.  I twirled the sculpture in my hands and thought about ancient Europeans in continental Europe hunting large mammals during the winter for food.  I thought about the structure of human societies and how historically women had stayed in the village and anchored the society/tribe while men went out in small bands to hunt.  How women often communicated better and had stronger personal networks while men often had stronger ambitions and tended to be better at spatial reasoning and strategy.  How modern society was being controlled and constrained and often broken and damaged by abstract representations of society on websites (Facebook, online dating, etc.).  How society and the economy were becoming more materialistic, more winner-take-all, more dependent on perceptions.  I envisioned hunting a wooly mammoth with a few lifelong tribesmen with spears, coming home to a wife in an age when divorce did not exist, when children were raised semi-communally and always had potential friends nearby (instead of going to school and being ripped away from their communities every time they graduated or their parents were forced to move by faceless corporate employers).
