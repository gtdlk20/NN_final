As I waited for the first car to slam into my paralyzed body an angel suddenly appeared, grabbing me by the arms and pulling me off the road. It was my friend Wolfgang the young German guy from Berlin. He spoke gently Are you alright? Its alright. Its alright. You freaked out on the road man, not cool, not cool! I suddenly dropped into near normal perception and thanked him for saving my life (which was exactly how it appeared to me).
