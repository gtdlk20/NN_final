It was at this point that J and I gave C a call to drive us around and smoke some weed as we had planned.  He took us out and we drove around our usual burn routes and the three of us smoked two bowls I believe.  The music playing in the car was all encompassing. I was trying hard to keep up in C who was quite talkative (as he tends to be when high) but the sensory experience was too powerful and I really didn't hear much of what he had to say from the back seat.  As we were driving I watched the clouds which had some of the most interesting visuals of the entire trip, the clouds seemed to bloom outwards into starburst shapes in time with the music we were listening to.  We parked beside a river which we had planned on going to watch but J vetoed the idea in favor of sitting in the car and listening to music.  I was fine with that idea at the time, enjoying the view of the bushes outside (the branches of which were waving around in a very lifelike manner) though in retrospect I wish we had gone out to enjoy the river.  Inside the confines of the car I started to get sucked into my mind and grew somewhat silent.
