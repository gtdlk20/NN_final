T: Another new friend. His experience with psychedelics is limited, but he takes the psychedelic experience very seriously. T had managed to get a hold of two and a half of the reputably strong 'fly' blotters that now seem to be flooding the northeast US. By my estimates these are 2 to 3 times as strong as the 'fractals' that everyone was so excited about during the summer jam band tours. T would be eating 1.25 flies.
