In reality, I briefly became conscious enough to recognize that I was stumbling through a small childrens play area at the base of the cul de sac. It's worth describing to you a little about the geography of where I was. Adjacent to the cul de sac is a small path which leads to about four flights of stone steps leading to a street below. This street is called 'Park lane'. If you go through the gap in the fence at the back of the children's play area there is a steep foliage ridden embankment that leads down to a flint gravel parking area at the rear of a Park lane hotel. Guess which route I took!
