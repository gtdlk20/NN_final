So i tried to find my clotes again, but no dice.  At least i had my shoes.  Now, if i could only find which way i was supposed to go.  I walked for a bit and ran into a 'DEP' officer.  I walked over to him and asked him how to get to get to the parking lot. He issued me a ticket.  I didn't have any pockets, so i slipped it in the window of a parked car along the road.  I kept walking, and if i saw a car approach, i would hide in the woods.  I stopped by another car along the road, and i asked a guy that was camping there  for a pair of pants i could wear.  He hooked me up with some pajamas pants.
