I had many thoughts over this period of time, but I let them flow by me. I held onto the only rock I had, which was not to think at all. The unfortunate result: many of these thoughts are buried deep in my memory. Every day new thoughts from that experience return to me. Over this period of time, my reality and who I was faded till it was just a memory. I did not think of my name at any time during this trip, so I do not know whether I knew it or not. I believed that if I forget my reality, I would not go back to it at all, that I would be stuck in the nonreality that I was in for the rest of my life.
