worse until I could not move.  When I moved, or if the bedsheet was moved over my legs and feet, the spasms in my back would twitch in protest.  But I had to turn myself over every few hours, and this was excruciating.  By about noon the day after we dropped, I still could not move without pain.  M brought me food in bed, and more movies.  I began to worry when I found the back pain did not leave my body even though I was no longer high.
