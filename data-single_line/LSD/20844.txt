22:00  Even though I was still going to come up from my sixth tab about 20 minutes later I took my seventh because I really wanted to go deep into the visuals. We were sitting outside and it had gotten quite dark. We had set up a phone light pointing up through a water bottle to make a sort of lantern and we ended up staring at it for what felt like hours. We would occasionally say to each other things like man this bottle and its just so good.
