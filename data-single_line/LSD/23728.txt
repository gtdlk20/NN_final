The moment that made the trip worthwhile was the movie 'Closer' with Jude Law and Natalie Portman.  I remember feeling sad and touched by the opening scene and the sad Damien Rice tune that lingered in the background.  I soon fell unconscious and awoke the next morning feeling relatively normal.  As I descended the stairs to make myself some coffee, I started crying.  I don't know why, but just thinking about that
