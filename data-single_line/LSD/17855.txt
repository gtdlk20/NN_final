Experiencing mental loops where you find yourself looping back to the same thoughts as if youre in a cage of your own making/mind, unable to break out. Conscious of the fact youre looping mentally but unable to stop these thoughts. I wrote in our journal at one point that it's a feeling of helplessness. Stuck in your mind, unable to stop looping. These loops arent always terrifying or bad, but you are unable at times to end the cycle, making you feel helpless, unable to control your own mind.
