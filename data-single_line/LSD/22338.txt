It was a Friday night and it was about 7:00 o'clock that my parents had gone out for the night to see a concert. They wouldn't be home until around 11:30 or midnight I had assumed. It was just my little sister at home, who stays in her room all the time anyway, and my good friend C and my boyfriend of 3 years A.
