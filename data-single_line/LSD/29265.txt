Acid was one of the best times I've had,the visuals where very interesting and have had me wondering for a while,trying to dissect just exactly what they could mean,because to me they where there for a reason,I believe drugs simply tap into different places of the mind by releasing certain chemicals. All though I promised my lover I would never do it again,but I have to say if I had the chance again I would most likely do it.
