I tried a few songs to accompany the visualizer, but nothing was weird enough. I wanted something fucked up - something so completely uncanny and off-sounding that I could have rejoiced at its peculiarity. Summer gave me a few suggestions, but everything sounded too conventional. No, I need avant-garde shit! I said. And as soon as I did, I knew a record that was uncomfortably smooth enough: Tim Buckleys Lorca. I remembered it because of a particular comment on its Rate Your Music page, along the lines of Ive heard stranger things before, but this is the one Tim Buckley people will frown at you for playing at a party, and I really wanted a party of heavy frowns, right then and there.
