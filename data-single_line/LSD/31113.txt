The packs of Lucky Strikes that Lorence and I had split (he bought them, and basically picked a couple up and leK the rest for me, that bastard), social cigarettes over beer outside in the cold winter, nights of post-joint chain-smoking all summer long... it was all in my past, and it all shaped who I was. It was a stupid habit, yeah sure, but one that I could not shake. A little passport of memories that had impacted me just as much as my clothes, or ideologies.
