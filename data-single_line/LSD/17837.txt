After awhile, and due to me pretty much drinking water the whole time (being on acid Ive discovered gives me a need to drink a lot), we decided to venture out of the computer room and towards the bathroom. Going to the bathroom and leaving the safety of the office/computer room is always a bit of a production for us when were tripping and we pretty much always do it together when we drop, as being apart seems to on occasion send Summer (or me possibly) into a bad space if we dont have each other there as a rock to lean on. At this point we were definitely on the come-up but not quite peaking yet. Pretty good amount of visuals, some audio distortion, and we definitely were getting into a mental head space together. After a thankfully uneventful trip to the bathroom, not counting the bug we saw on the wall haha, we were back in the office just chilling and watching our trip playlist on the 4k flat screen TV.
