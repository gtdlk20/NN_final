The next thing that happened though really threw me off guard. I crossed the street to walk up this hill back to suburbia and then this motorcycle zooms right past me while I'm on the sidewalk and it's driving down the street and it was so startling and loud. I didn't physically flinch I don't think but in my head I definitely did and I was thinking wow that was loud and surprising and so I realized at that point I was definitely feeling the effects of the drug whatever drug chemical this is.
