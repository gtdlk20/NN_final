That didn't happen, I hadn't fallen asleep and the time now was 7.30am. I climbed out of bed and got changed for school. I was still tripping, not the hard 5 hours but the post hardcore trip which lasts around 10 hours. I was very tired and very confused. I left my house and needed to get a weekly travel ticket for the bus. I went into the store and also got a large bottle of water along with my ticket. When the guy asked for the money of the ticket + water I got very confused as I had forgotten to calculate the water bottle. I asked him why it was more expensive than usual. When I asked this he told me I was also buying the water bottle. I then felt as though he knew that I was on drugs. I kept saying to myself, 'Oh no, he probably thinks IÂ’m one of those common drug addict thugs'.
