I met up with my friends, who nominated me to light the fire. Please take note that campfires and being well beyond stoned do not go hand in hand AT ALL, and I ended up with a few 2nd degree bruns on my hand as a result. I ended up giving the firelighting rights to another of my friends and I started telling stories - simple ones that I was familiar with, giving overly animated sound effects and being very outgoing and very loose in telling them. After my second story, I got up and went to stand by the water and watch the moon light up the night.
