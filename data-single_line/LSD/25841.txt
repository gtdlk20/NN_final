A very interesting time. The most intense trip I could ever imagine having. I had a good time, despite my friend, who returned to reality shortly after returning to the camp, though I don't think he will ever try LSD again. I'm sure I will, but it's gonna be a while, this trip had given me a lot to think about, especially musically and about the connections between band audience, and other things of that nature. It reminded me very much of what I'm imagining the acid tests were like in the '60s. Always check to make sure you know the potency of the acid you're taking, this stuff was amazingly strong, and really did send us to the cosmos. I almost lost control a couple times and my friend did. Never ever ever underestimate acid, that's the only advice I can give to anyone.
