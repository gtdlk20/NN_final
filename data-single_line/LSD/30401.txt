After a while, I got tired of the winamp visuals so I went outside to play more X-box with the guys. It was at this point that I started feeling the inebriating effect of the LSD. I wasn't able to concentrate on the game, and Halo seemed so complicated and confusing. Then all of a sudden, I look on the screen and I see my friend's cat running around in the level being chased and shot at. Nothing else interesting happened after that and I began to come down soonafter.
