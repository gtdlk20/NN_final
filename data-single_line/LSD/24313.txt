I later found out that Jim took an 1/8 ounce of shrooms later that night. Damn, he must have fried hard. I've had many more trips since then but that one was special because it was the first real adventure where I went around totally crazy. All in all, I had a very positive experience. Sorry about how long this is, but I feel I needed to use some detail. Peace Out!
