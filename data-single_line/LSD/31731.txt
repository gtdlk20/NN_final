The reason I am actually writing this experience comes down to the point where my friend fell asleep and I was left there to fall asleep. It was 3am and I was probably at my peak. I tend to worry a lot and have been on meds previously  (I went off paxil 2 years ago) for depression and anxiety. I am a lesbian and have not come out to my parents so I lots of emotional baggage, which I was quite aware could end in a disaster for my trip. The exact opposite of a disaster is what I experienced. I rehearsed what I was going to tell my parents, I worked out problems with my love life, I consoled myself and actually formed some self esteem. I felt like I was someone else viewing my life and reassessing it, I realized that so many problems I thought were so bad actually were quite fixable and small. I cried, I even threw up and saw eyes in my puke. The visuals I had were amazing, I stayed and layed in my friends spare bed from 3am to 9am when a repair man came to fix her water tank, where I fell asleep to the sound of him banging away at metal. I didn't want to fall asleep knowing he was going to show up early, but as soon as he did I was actually soothed by the loud noises. My friend woke up at 11am and had an intense headache which lasted far in to the evening. I think it probably had to do with the fact that she didn't have the brain activity that I did, I'm sure if my brain tried to sleep as it was so fucked up I would have had  a headache too.
