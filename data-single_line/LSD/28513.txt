I have been an experienced drug user for about 6 years now, doing almost every drug imaginable in my past, but finally cutting it down primarily to pot and alcohol. Getting most of my drug use out of my system before even getting to college, I was more than satisfied with sticking to herb and brew. I did enjoy eating mushrooms or acid every time I got the chance due to them being relatively rare drugs around my area and have tripped shrooms about 35 times and had about 8-9 previous lsd experiences eating as much as 3 hits at a time.
