As I started coming down I took a second tab and went home. In my room, I listened to music and laid in the dark with my eyes closed enjoying the closed-eye visuals but annoyingly I fell asleep about 3 hours later. I don't really know how, I just suddenly woke up in the morning and felt like I had wasted the tab as I barely reached the second peak!
