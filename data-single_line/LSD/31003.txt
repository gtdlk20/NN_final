As I still stared at the blue stickman, I realized I was it. I was the stickman and Seth was the little seal, because I had always been on top of him (technically, in more ways than one, but Im trying to be serious here, so Im keeping it on a strictly emotional level). Yes! I thought to myself, yes, yes! I was the one with the power, and he was just a tiny little fragment of my life.
