Beginning at the time I got to the residence, the following hour and a half or so was characterized by 30-45 seconds of conscious awareness, then 20-30 seconds of subconscious actions.  I would do things uncontrollably, snap out of it, and then fade back into a subconscious and delusional realm.  These subconscious delusions and altered perceptions faded in and out every minute or so for about two hours.  The entire time, I certainly had a heightened sense of awareness; my senses were keen, my memory was clear, and I felt very focused.  In spite of my misperception of true reality, my delusional state was one of clarity.
