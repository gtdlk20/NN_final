I think that day I found God.  He is inside me, inside every human, I just needed acid to find it.  For the first time I felt complete, like I knew what direction I wanted my life to go in.  Acid revealed to me what I wanted.  Looking back, it seems now that my whole life before I never knew or did what I truly wanted.
