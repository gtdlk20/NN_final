At this point we are near familiar features such as the fountain and the arcade room.  C suggests we go play video games to try to calm our minds down.  Willing to believe anything to gain a bit of sanity I follow him in.  The instant I set foot in the arcade I knew it was a terrible idea.  Flashing colors were everywhere, and millions and millions of computerized sounds echoing off the walls, all merging together and creating one very strange and unpleasant hum.  I knew there were people in the arcade but I couldn't distinguish any bodies, I could just hear the voices echoing in my mind.  The first game that has a seat I plop down and stare at the screen in front of me.  I feel very awkward sitting inside the tiny car video game, but I feel that it's too late to change my mind.  I find quarters and put them in the machine.  C helps me start the game but soon he is playing a game of his own and I am left to figure out on my own.  I sit and stare like a retard until the game starts on its own.  I realize that I have to drive a car and press the pedal.  I'm moving but moving extremely slow.  The colors on the video game look extremely unrealistic and they start swaying and bubbling.  After about two minutes of staring like a retard I put the car into second gear.  I like going fast.  I start laughing very loudly but I can't stop playing the game because I haven't finished yet.  After about 10 minutes of me and C laughing hysterically playing a racing game we stumble out of the arcade and finally agree to look for S.
