As we listened to our CD I closed my eyes and let my mind wander.  I imagined a woman dressed in a cloak from the future placing an object on a pillar.  I couldn't see what it was because the item was bright like the sun.  She placed it on the pillar and the light grew until it was brighter than the sun and in an instant it was gone.  Teleported back in time where it would be safe.
