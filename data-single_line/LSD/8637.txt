I emerged back into the light and things really began to break down in terms of what I remember. Time got very jumpy as we walked across another parking lot and began walking into town. For some reason I did not get paranoid as we walked along a fairly main artery into town. L began to speak of the absurdity of large SUVs and how they should be made illegal and whatnot (granted we saw more hybrids than we saw SUVs in our town, but L is very passionate about such things).  At one point in this conversation he uttered the words that stuck with me forever cars are so loud and unfortunate. It was at that moment that my entire worldview changed and Im pretty sure Ive never been the same. I cant explain how, it was a very subtle change. But violent movies arent quite as appealing anymore, angry music seems immature, anger in general is bizarre, and television commercials and the way people act on them seem downright strange. I feel as though it retuned my bullshit detector to high.
