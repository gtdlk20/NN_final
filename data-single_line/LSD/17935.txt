LSD is really great. But you never know what will come of it. There is always a journey involved, usually with some struggles, fear, and paranoia. Seeming truths arise and pass away. It may be possible to hold them for a while, but in the end you are holding to something different than the truth that once was. The psychedelic and entheogenic qualities of the drug seem to allow the mind to compress and expand experience without as many walls or rules as usual. It is interesting how there are consistent patterns to one's experience, though. The senses and the habits of personality, emotion, and cognition do flex and bend, but there is regularity and repetition. Sometimes it is happy, sometimes sad; LSD is a great potentiator. This experience was a culmination of many acid experiences. Yes, it is everything; yes, it is nothing. The journey continues.
