Two days ago, I went to get my second Tattoo done and my first one retouched, and decided, since I don't get tattoos often, and I had a tab with me, I should eat it, and I did, and let me tell you something, NOT A GOOD IDEA, at least not from the acid side, I was so concentrated on keeping the pain away, that I didn't peak on the acid, only after the tattoos where done and I relaxed, I got the acid working, and it was After Peak, I was comming down, and I was never really up, the good part is that I was able to keep most of the pain away thanks to the acid since when I relaxed, the pain also came flaring back with a Bad attitude.
