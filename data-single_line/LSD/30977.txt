Here, she handed me a large white t-shirt, you know one of those they hand you somewhere youve actually been to, along with a pair of checkered pink and black bottoms. They were a little large on my small frame, but it was comfortable. Actually, it felt amazing. Like every inch of the fabric was cuddling my body. A pajama acid hug. The whole thing was so pleasing that I didnt even mind my wet, long hair looking especially brown and curly in its state. Id stood there so long it wasnt even dripping anymore, just a little damp. Not to mention, my underwear had gotten soaked with Diannas shorts, from before (we never took our bottoms off, in the shower) and so I was having my first, and painfully necessary, college-commando experience. Even letting my lady parts breathe helped me calm down.
