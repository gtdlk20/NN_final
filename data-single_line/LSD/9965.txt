I went back and laid on the couch and reached out and felt like I made a spiritual connection with my uncle who I was very close to growing up. He was like my role model and I respect him. He is a very wise spiritual man. I felt overwhelmed with good vibes again and once again felt like I was purging out the negativity in my body. I called him and when he heard me rambling about how I dropped 7 doses and was tapped the f*** in and didnÂ’t remember what I was supposed to be doing here and I am totally lost and on and on and on he laughed.
