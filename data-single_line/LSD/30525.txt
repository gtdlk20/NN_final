So, just before we got there by car, we decided to take 5 hits of blotter acid each, which according to descriptions and effects of one to two dose hits, which we'd tried earlier that summer, I'd say these were 80-100 mic tabs (even one hit caused noticible distortions and synthestesia effects and a full 12 hour trip) After only about 15-20 minutes the effects started (that weak, trembling rush) and I noticed that the music from my friends car stereo was dancing off the dunes and clouds aboove as we drove on. A hawk flew by and left an orange, blue, green trail behind as it passed by my field of vision.
