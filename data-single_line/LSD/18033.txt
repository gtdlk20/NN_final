Sonny talked me into doing them then instead of later so I bought 2 more but when he gave me the 2nd hit he 'accidently' gave me a 3rd hit. after this we got 2 hits for Barry's brother and went to his house, on the way there I noticed my weed buzz was getting better and better, I could tell that I was starting to come up, and then when we got there I realized I had never been so fucked up in my life, Rachael told me to walk in the bathroom with her and she pointed at the flowery wallpaper in Greg's bathroom, the flowers began to move slowly, and I started thinking to mysself this is it Im beginning to trip. As I walked out of the bathroom into Greg's living room I felt the ground shaking like an earthqauke I really freaked out because I didnt know that I could feel stuff like that when you are tripping but I guess you can. After I figured out what was really going on I walked outside with everyone else.
