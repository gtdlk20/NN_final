Back at the apartment, Lex and myself proceeded to entertain our drug-crazed guests as best we could. Fortunately, given their state of mind, they would have been content trying to make conversation with a stapler, so we didn't need to strain ourselves. We decided to eat our shares of the acid on the spot, being that our friends were already warming up to their oncoming experience. After a bit of an argument over the sparse contents of our nearly emptied stomachs, we elected to take 500mg Vitamin-C pills, two at a time for the next several hours. Lex being the acid veteran, he insisted the vitamins would make for a better trip. I had no choice but to agree. After all, why trip if you're not going to TRIP?!?
