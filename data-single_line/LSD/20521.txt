One of the most life changing moments of the night was when I was sitting there in the canyon back in the chairs with such an intense feeling of akashic oneness and universal collective oneness. Like I was in and part of the universal awareness but also like I had tapped into something that I had never fully considered or thought of before and it was the Akashic Records or something comparable to that. I never even knew what they were called before this and since this trip IÂ’ve always been thinking about them and akasha in general. Even when just smoking weed now I think about it. I felt the overwhelming feeling that I was connected to the essence of and acid trips of everyone who had EVER taken acid ever. I felt strong revolutionary vibes echoed throughout the canyon and felt connected to the hippies and the artists, murderers, psychos, scientists, druggies, philosophers, medical patients, architects etc. Maybe even those in America who were poisoned by Ergot in the 1600s? These were the ones who freaked and saw 'witches' and had troubling hallucinations and delusions from being poisoned by ergot of course. A lot of experts now think ergot induced delusions and hallucinations were likely the most responsible culprit for the Salem Witch Trials. That would explain maybe some of the common and creepy folklorish archetypes of LSD and possibly other egrolines or ergot derivatives.
