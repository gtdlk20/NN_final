First of all, I feel like I need to outline the fact that I was with my ex-boyfriend (with whom I'd decided to stay friends- although that has changed now) and his friends (4 of us all together). Sober, I felt completely comfortable with these people. I had a respect for acid before I'd tried it and therefore listened to my friends who had already taken it and I put myself in a setting in which I felt relaxed and myself (as they had directed me to). I took it inside, with purposefully placed wall-hangings and mattresses on the floor with a big set of speakers near by, with the ipod already playing deep house/liquid drum and bass.
