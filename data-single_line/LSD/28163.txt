I can't tell you the details of several hours where all memories are kida fuzzy, all I can remember is a feeling.  A feeling of joy, contentness.  More so than MDMA can ever give you.  My three best friends in the world, a different world perhaps, and I were all dumb as animals, trying to get a grasp on reality, but there was no hurry in getting to wherever we were going.  We had all night, and memories of school and the campus were so incredably distant as to be a dream.  It was amazing how much like a dream the past 18 years of my life were.  Reality wasn't reality at all, and I was finally awakened from it, into a far better place where reality is constantly changing at the touch of a thought.
