They told me they'd been looking for me for over an hour, that they had panicked and were fighting and crying over whether or not to call the police. R had told everyone what she thought I did. They also said that, before I ran off in what they called a fit of ecstacy, everyone had gathered together for a group photo. I was later shown the photo, and I was in it, right in front, a big smile on my face, but I'll be DAMNED if I can remember posing for it. I still swear, to this day, that I was never in the photograph.
