But while walking around the house I felt a sudden kind of jolt or something in my head, like my consciousness had periodically been jerked out of my head, all of a sudden I didnt really know where I was and no longer felt with it. All my hearing had become muffled and strange so I sat down and felt a bit better. Then it happened again but stronger this time, it was then I realised what Id got myself into. I turned the heating off and went to my room, closed my curtains and got into bed. Strangely enough I felt far more sane with my eyes closed. I spent the next hour in this position freaking out, I was panicking as my mum would be home in about 2 hours and I didnt know how long I would be like this for. I certainly wouldnt have been able to hold down a conversation and not let on that I was fucked.
