Neo and I got home (after a very intense drive, let me tell you) at around 5:30am. I thought the trip was going away, but I was wrong. My feet looked white and the joints looked purple, and they looked like the feet of a corpse. It didn't bother me, but they did hurt, and were about as cold as a corpse's feet too. I kept saying I thought I had frostbite (in Miami? yea right!). My room looked really pretty. It had a soft pinkish glow, and everything seemed really colorful and interesting. I never realized what a good tripping room I had, even though a friend told me so a long time ago. Well, i got in bed, and hard as I might try, I could NOT sleep. When I closed my eyes, I kept seeing a weird pattern of shapes that looked like letters, but not quite. Maybe they were alien letters. Anyway, they were all over everything, as though a screen of them had been draped over my eyes, and they were turning every color of the rainbow. I had been seeing them since the beginning of the trip, and were getting annoying. After miserably watching the sun come up, I fell asleep for a few hours, and had all sorts of acid dreams, which looked like splatters of paint being shot this way and that. I was completely fried and exhausted the next day. At least I didn't feel like rolling anymore, though!
