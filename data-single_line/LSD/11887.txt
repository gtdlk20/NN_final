06:30am - #1 way to fuck with someone who took lots of acid:  Turn on all of the lights in the building suddenly, after it has been dark for the past 7.5 hours.  Wow.  Time to leave, so we went outside.  That was when I truly realized how much acid I had taken.  The sun had risen and everything was a beautiful ultra intense pastel color.  The clouds were rippling and shooting across the sky at extremely high speeds.  I was cold, so naturally the trees became covered with frost and icicles.  The condensation on the windows of the car turned to frost, too (it didn't, I verified it with my friends), and slowly melted as I warmed up.  On the drive home, houses in the distance were pulsating and sinking into the ground, and a radio tower duplicated itself about 99 times, filling the horizon with copies.  Thought a lot about my life on that ride, until about 10 minutes from home when I thought a lot about peeing. :-) Felt, smelled, tasted, and saw a smell at the same time.
