 The first hours of the trip weren't all that great, nothing 'interesting' was happening and the visuals were just mild, also a constant feeling of uneasiness and fear accompanied me. I was having illogical thoughts, mainly that my trip would go bad like all the other times and that my neighbours could hear everything I was doing/saying. But as I was moving closer towards the peak of the experience, I tried to calm myself and abolish such thoughts, by using reasoning, although that last thought of everyone inside a certain km radius could hear us trip sadly accompanied me all throughout the trip.
