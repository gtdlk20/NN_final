Well I had quite a reaction to this fire, my eyes were open but I could see nothing in the room, instead a strange little movie was playing inside my head. All I could see was the planet Earth floating in the blackness, and there was one giant house sitting on top of the planet, it was Drew's house, and it was on fire. I was floating rapidly away from the Earth just looking at Drew's house burning there and it was the end of the world. And I was very sad.
