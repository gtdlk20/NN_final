It was about 5 hours since we took the LSD when V texted me, asking if I wanted to jam. I said yes, so we went over to the building with all the rehearsal rooms. I play guitar, and V got behind the drums and started laying down this really groovy beat. I felt like I was playing like a god, and that we had an almost telepathic connection: every time I began playing a different melody or riff, V got the mood I was going for immediately. I felt like Santana at woodstock, that the guitar was a snake I had to tame. I could really feel the music, and one time we both started playing slower and slower, feeling like time became warped and we entered a different dimension where time didnÂ’t go as fast as here on earth.
