The walk back was similar to the other treks through the dark woods. Everything I could see was a part of a beautiful pattern. D and F also saw patterns. Upon returning to the house, we all agreed that 4:00am was a reasonable time to go to sleep.  We went to bed, and though I'm still unsure whether they managed to go to sleep, I was in a complete state of insomnia.  I laid in bed for an hour or so before the effects of the pot took its toll on me and I passed out.
