Eventually the task was completed. We stopped for a moment to stare at little fragments of weed that were still on the table. They had turned into red insects, maybe red ants (or tiny red caterpillars), and were crawling around. After studying them for five or ten minutes we began to smoke. At this point we were beginning to feel very drowsy and irritable. Our bodies and minds were tired but our brains were still wired awake. The friend whose house it was desperately needed sleep as he had to be at work by 9am that morning. It was between 5 and 6am when we finally decided to crash. As my brain was still wide awake I had entire operas and music videos playing in my head when I shut my eyes. The sub-conscious part of my brain tended to make up the words, the music was made by Goldfrapp I think.
