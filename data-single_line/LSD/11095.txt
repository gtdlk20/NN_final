I have never looked at art that way before! Not only were the images coming out of my monitor in three dimensions, often levitating inches away from the screen, but every part of the art was constantly growing, pulsating, and changing with infinitely more detail than sober eyes could ever behold. In each piece of art there were thousands of stories to be told, and I could follow the progress of each living piece of art through the image. It was absolutely beautiful.
