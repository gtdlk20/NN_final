About a half hour later I could feel the acid coming on. I decided to put on some more uptempo music so I popped in 'Demetertainment', a Twisted Records psytrance compilation. Beast - 'Spawn' was sounding a might fucking nice! ;) The acid was coming on and I kept repeating to myself: 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - as I felt my mindstate elevating.
