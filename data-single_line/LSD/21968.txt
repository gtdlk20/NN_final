That was the last time I have taken acid which was about a year ago. It really put me off wanting to do it again because of the shit show that it turned out to be. While I didn't necessarily have a bad trip, there  were moments when it was almost too intense for me to handle. I plan on doing more again soon but it is not a drug I take lightly.
