Alright so here it is all laid out. Not a very perfectly planned journey by any means but I did learn a few very important lessons about my life and life in general and all around it was a very good experience. Throughout the night before dropping I had around 4 or 5 beers. Around 4:25a.m. I decided to drop 3 hits of the blotter which I recently acquired from a loving brother. The first hour was spent in my room just laying down watching TV I donÂ’t exactly remember what was on the TV at the time. When it reached 5:25a.m. I was feeling nothing so I decided to drop two more. Layed there and watched some more TV until it reached about 5:40 a.m. when I felt like I had diarrhea coming on from some little caesars pizza and crazy bread I hate ate a few hours earlier. My mother was just getting out of the bathroom and getting ready to head to work.
