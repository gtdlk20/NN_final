It was a beautiful day and G, R and I had just bought a strip of Dragon Ball Z acid the previous day. We called it this because or plug only sold LSD on sheets with the DBZ logo. Due to the weather, we decided it would be a perfect day to drop and we each took one tab of 200ug strength. We then drove around the city and pulled endless gbs as we waited for the acid to kick in, (dont drive on acid we are stupid). At about 30mins in I began to feel the familiar warm euphoric glow and I knew I was in for a great trip. A another 30mins had passed and we headed back to G & Rs apartment as it was really starting to kick in for them but for me the warmth and euphoria had only grown stronger and I had yet to experience and visual. This was odd as I usually begin to experience visuals early on into the trip.
