We had one other friend who took four hits of this same blotter and had a very rough trip. The effects lasted so long that she didnÂ’t feel as if she ever really came down, and again the cold, harshly analytical nature of this compound got to her. She struggled with the integration process for months, and needed lots of support from friends as well as some conventional psychotherapy.
