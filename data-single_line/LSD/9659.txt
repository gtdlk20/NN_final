Sorry if the story jumps around a bit, I was writing it as the memories came back, explaining that theory is definitely hard, its still something I cant even believe I thought up the complexities of, but I cant explain it very well. It also makes me think we could be the cancer of this earth, the one with the wrong genetic mutation that started rapidly multiplying that will expand until it kills off the whole universe, but it doesnt matter itll all start again right??? It felt like god was saying YOU HAVE WORKED IT ALL OUT GO BACK TO JAIL, DO NOT COLLECT $200, like I'd learnt something I wasn't meant to learn before death and I could never go back to naievity, but in saying that, I must now teach everyone peace of mind, I am someone with knowledge who must bring knowledge to those less enlightened then myself, and not by telling them what I experienced but by challenging their consciousness too, to achieve a transcendental consciousness of civilization.
