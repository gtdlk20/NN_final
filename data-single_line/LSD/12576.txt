I don't think I actually believe the metaphysical implications of the statement in a sober state  but at the time it seemed to make perfect sense. The fundamental level causality  Her  was of course my TRUE mother. The woman who physically gave birth to me was a much lower level of causality. That actually jived with materialism just fine. But she seemed to imply that both my physical mother and myself had had many experiences prior to our current lifespans.
