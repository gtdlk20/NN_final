I walked out of the bathroom and looked around.  Color shifting had almost ceased.  I think I fell asleep on the toilet for an hour or two.  The den had lightened a bit.  I looked outside and the sun was rising.  Had I really been panicking for 12 hours?  What part was real?  Was it a nightmare?  The answer is 'yes' and 'no'.
