We stood up and walked into the incredibly bright bathroom. We stood next to each other, staring into what seemed like a carnival mirror that I could bend with my mind. After making the mirror bend so much I felt like throwing up, and gasping for air between laughter, I dragged my self, now fully tripping, coming up strong and fast, from the bathroom and crawled into the den flat on my stomach, because I though that if I stood up, booby traps hidden in the wall would pop out and attack me.
