They were somewhere else, but I wasnt with them. I was caught up in figuring out a way to get the paint off of my body without getting my hair wet. I sat by the tub, in front of the sink, with knees up to my nose. I found that I still couldnt help but touch myself, I needed to feel my body there, with my mind. I was afraid that if I didnt, everything would have disconnected. I stared at my legs a lot, but I wasnt exactly tripping; I mean, by that point I still hadnt felt extremely visually engaged by the trip. It seemed a little like weed, the colors looked nicer and brighter, but I hadnt seen.
