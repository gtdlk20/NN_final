I managed to bite down on the urge to run and made it to the bar and my friends. By this point though, reality stopped having any meaning. I can't describe things at this point. There was just colours, and noise, and faces, and eyes and I bolted. I was out of the pub like a jack rabbit, on my own. Days later, a girl who I was at the bar with said this was hilarious, that I was standing there stock still save my eyes, which were darting this way and that before I lurched into a sprint through the front door. I can see the funny side, now.
