 2 hours 30 minutes in: Brandon finally noticed me, sitting on the couch behind him, and he got in my face. He was smiling wide and his teeth were so white compared to his skin, they seemed to be glowing. But all was not well, I believed that I had called him a 'n-word', and that must be why he was getting in my face and being so excited. Brandon was saying, 'You called me a n-word! What do you mean man? How could you call me that? Oh man you're in big trouble! How could you do it, oh... How could you!?'
