Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]   It had to be 11 pm and because of the snow storm nobody was traveling on the roads. Also I figured I swerved slightly because of the effects of the acid I could blame it on the snow. It wasnt really that bad at first. I really tried to concentrate only on driving and that wasnt all too difficult. I began to feel connected through the car somehow while driving along. Especially so when I pressed the breaks, I could feel the pulsation of the anti-lock breaks. It seemed to shoot up through my entire body and it almost felt like a pain. Similar to that sort of pain associated with nails on a chalk board.
