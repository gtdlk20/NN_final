August 2002, the night was young, people partying having a good time. Some one approaches, 'hey you want to split a half hit of acid?' I think to myself, not really, but I want to stay in the same mind set as my boyfriend. My boyfriend takes the hit and rips it in half, eats one half and hands me the other. My worst mistake ever.
