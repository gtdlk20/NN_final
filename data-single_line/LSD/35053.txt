We relocated ourselves to the front room and sat in front of the big windows and just basked in the sun for awhile. I was feeling pretty good. Then I heard a woman scream. Heard a kid being smacked. Heard a baby cry. I looked out and saw the beautiful tall old trees, taller than our building, and thought of all the horrible human mess below. I then proceeded to cry non-step for more than half an hour.
