I wonder if I could have gone farther.  I wonder if I could have really hurt myself in that state.  Without fear of harm or dying, I could have jumped off a cliff or who knows what.  Fortunately I didn't.  I did climb up onto the roof of my cottage and stare into the sun, an acid trip cliche.  This is where I felt that I may be a being who is 'between worlds', something that had recently died.  I felt this once before on mushrooms several years earlier.  I was there again, but of course I had no context and no way to find myself to compare this current trip to the previous one.
