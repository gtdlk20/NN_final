Somehow I gave in to my man's request for sexual intercourse. I found myself naked on the bed again. I felt like I was going to sink into the mattress like someone sinks into quicksand and I assumed I would be suffocated. It took an intense effort to keep myself sane enough to recongnize the fear as completely insane. Then he was doing what guy's do and I was enduring it. I usually love it. I felt like my limbs were shrinking. Like rapidly deflating balloons and that my skull was collapsing. I thought he was going to meld with me like two plastic pieces being melted and stuck together forever. I felt like my limbs were shrinking. Like rapidly deflating balloons and that my skull was collapsing. I thought he was going to meld with me like two plastic pieces being melted and stuck together forever. We'd be like siamese twins conected at the genitals. I focused on staying calm. I heard footsteps, but disregarded them. I heard a man laugh. A man say, 'There indisposed.' Then a door close. I still do not know whether or not a worker walked in and witnessed or drugged copulation or if it was a hallucination.
