At 2am, we awoke B, who lives next door to one other house.  It was a cold, winter night and we shuffled indoors to stay warm.  Once indoors, B greeted us with some organic tea.  We lit candles and made ourselves comfortable with some Dj Cam.  We each took just 2 hits (later to become an inside joke), and centered ourselves for what was to become the energetic apheleon of our lives.
