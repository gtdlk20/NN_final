After we all got out we all just kinda spread out a little bit in the feild and I was lying on my back and so was everyone else and we were anywhere from 15 to 50 feet away from each other and we could all talk in normal volume and we could hear each other perfectly clear, it was as if we left our bodies on the ground and our souls had flown to the sky. We layed there for about 10 minues, after that we decided we should go back to Greg's but on our way back to his house the guy that owned the feild showed up and the sad thing was I didnt realize it because I was licking on a grape sucker and I started staring at it because the different shades of purple was moving around and making cool shapes, when I realized that the owner was there I caught myself laughing my ass off, Greg got me to be quiet but I couldnt help it.
