We have finally made it to cedar point and we are now waiting in line.  I can feel the beginning effects of the acid kick in.  S tells me that it took a long time for it to fully kick in for him, 90 minutes as he described it.  I don't believe him at the time, but I would soon find out he was right.	I see a man walking around and talking to random people and wanting to know whats going on I ask him what he's doing.  He tells me this crazy story which I couldn't follow and then offers me 2 tickets for 25 dollars each.  I think wow that sounds good, they are 42 at the gate.  	'Do they work' I ask him.
