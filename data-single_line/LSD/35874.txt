From there we went and got food, I purchase two sausages rolls and tried to eat them both at same time whilst laughing with myself following my group around, another half hour passes and I come to a point I realise everyone else is dancing and I'm trying to eat sausage rolls. So I THROW my rolls down and dance in victory over those delicious pastry's.
