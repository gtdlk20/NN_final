At the same time, I'm glad that I had that trip because it's what I needed to scare me away from acid. I've finally come to accept the fact that LSD does fuck with your head, and I was always in denial of this before. I think LSD is more of a once in a life time thing that most people should experience. It makes me want to be productive and get my life straightened out once I start coming back to reality. I'm not sure how my brain is going to be affected by all my tripping but I know that now is the time to make a change in my life and stop doing drugs. I don't feel nearly as sane as I used to. I look at myself in the mirror now and my pupils are still huge and I just look like shit. I look like a crazy man and I really need to change. I bought the ticket, and I took the ride. I don't know if I regret it yet but I have a feeling that this will benefit me in some ways and damage me in other ways.
