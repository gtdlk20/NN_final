This is where shit gets weird. One of my more interesting frat brothers (Ill call him Carter) approached me not an hour later with an offer to trip if I could pay for three tabs of acid. This was really strange given that we werent very close and I hadnt hit anybody up yet. Meant to be, or mere coincidence? Im not so sure, but needless to say I accepted his offer. By now the stars were coming out and the frat was mostly empty. It was a clear, calm night.
