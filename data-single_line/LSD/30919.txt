I edged closer to stare at that spectacle, and watched carefully, as the hole, which, by that point, had definitely become the sinks mouth, opened and closed ever-so-steadily. But it wasnt a calm inhale and exhale... it was gradual, but by no means relaxed. It was frantic, lonely, and bleak. I heard Summer calling my name, wondering why I hadnt jumped in, but Dianna quickly explained to her that I was gone into my world. Then again, I totally understood everything, I did hear them - I just chose not to care; the sink seemed like a such a bigger deal at the moment.
