After this is when the trip starting going...not bad per se, but not totally enjoyable. I attribute this to my being alone, bored and tired. Wasn't panicky or scared or anything, I'd just run out of ideas and was kinda lonely. I began to think that this was, while an interesting drug, a sterile one. I felt 2-dimensional and like I'd lost my connection with earth/life/nature/etc. Really all those things wrapped into a word I don't think exists. I believed this to be the case because it is a man made chemical and thus unnatural. Music was going through my head and for a split second I saw in the swinging blinds a pendulum composed of spinning sawblades mowing through a field of corpses. I thought this was really cool, logged it in my thoughts and then continued my introspection. Time stretched and I wallowed in bed for awhile. I kept seeing in my head a really cool purple cloud that said LSD. I tasted purple. I STILL can taste purple though it is like the memory of a dream. Again this wasn't so much enjoyable as it was interesting. I wanted my trip to end, wanted to go to sleep. I stopped hallucinating to any strong degree at about 7:30-8am. I watched the news and felt an intense loathing at the fakeness of the program. They would giggle and fake laughter about a parade of santa's, then turn somber and dark to talk about a soldiers death, then happy again as a kitten got adopted. At 9am my trip had stopped completely though I still felt a bit...funny. Went next door to my friends and banged on the door yelling 'Dude! I need to talk to a human, man! A HUMAN!' For the next several hours I was a bit overheated and felt a kind of sizzling/popping sensation. Felt good though. I forced down some chinese food later though I wasn't at all hungry and felt totally normal at around 4pm.
