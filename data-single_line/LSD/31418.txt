Zoned out to the walls for about a half an hour, I told someone to plug in a movie. They put in chronicals of narnia(crazy on lsd). I had never seen that movie before, and the only thing I remember from it was wolves coming out of no where, and they freaked the shit out of me. After an half an hour of that we decided to get a ride home.
