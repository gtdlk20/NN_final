When we got back, I took another hit and the rest is history. My mind was pretty gone. I donÂ’t know how I was able to walk around at that point. I vaguely remember chewing on my shirt and beating a drum along with staring at myself in the mirror for over and hour because of how crazy my face was changing. My shadows made me look like Jesus and I smoked over 2packs of cigarettes in less than 6 hours. I tripped for a good 14hours.
