After another hour of skating town, not knowing where to go, we realized we were way to high to skate, so we decided to head to a friends. When we showed up there, there was loud music being played, Tool I recall. When I got inside the peak hit me. I was zoned out to the walls mealting down to the floor too faces coming out of the wall.
