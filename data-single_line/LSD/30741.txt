All of a sudden I felt myself burst into some kind of dimension.  Where all this light was coming from.  I was floating, flowing, soaking in it.  I could see inside my body and I saw it being filled with these streams of light.  Things would slow, then speed up amazingly fast and I couldn't keep up, but at all times it was ecstatic.
