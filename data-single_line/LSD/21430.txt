I spent the next 2-3 hours in an endless game of tug-of-war between this state of egolessness and my ego which was trying to process what just happened. I was beginning to think I had lost my mind, which of course caused me to get the idea that I might be having a bad trip which sparked another thought loop over questions such as Who is tripping right now? What makes a good trip vs a bad trip? If there is no ego, then who is going to come down from this trip?
