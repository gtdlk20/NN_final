At this point we all where pretty buzzed and we took some time to look at our surroundings. It seemed to us that the dome was indeed very large and kind of slowly rocking back and forth. A light breeze lifted the canvas we had on top of the dome in the most peculiar way and we felt a funny melancholy and we told each other that we had ruined our cozy low to the ground dome and turned it into a ball skeleton with a funny looking cap, a fragment of our secure shelter from the previous day. Giggling we told each other that we have to do something about that the next day realizing that there was no turning back at this point. We had brought bicycles to the event but decided to be safe as people where rolling in and looking for friend and campsites and it seemed a bit unsafe to bike around right at that time.
