I looked around and Nathan was there on the couch with a little box with an itty bitty bow on top.  I asked if that was to be my birthday present and he replied with a smile and nod.  He said that I should open it now and that's exactly what I did.  All I saw inside was a little plastic bag on top of a cotton cushion.  Inside that bag contained a 9 hit square of extremely potent blotter.  Later, I would find out exactly how powerful this was.
