After a while we were able to get up, talk, walk to the beach and with the sun setting decided we could party now. We smoked some weed, drank some beer and smoked cigarettes. Later on we got out the boombox and listened to various Beatles, Pink Floyd and other albums. We had a great life-affirming day and although we are both successful family men now who live thousands of miles apart, we often discuss that one day and the wonder of it all.  LOVE
