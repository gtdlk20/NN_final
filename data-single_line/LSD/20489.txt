When we first started reflecting on what had just happened and all the craziness of the night so far (we thought the experience was over) and my friend starts talking about my Russian friend and he says yeah man..Bad vibes seriously bad vibes over there and we could both really really feel it when he said that and almost could see it. There was so much going on visually and emotionally with each word and thought. I remember this is when the closed eye visuals were really vivid and impressive and since it was dark the closed eye visions were overlaid over everything I looked at. Especially the things that were dark and natural.
