During my history class, I began to wonder what had happened earlier on that day, how I'd gotten dressed and gotten to school. As I went to leave, I realized that I'd DRIVEN to school!! I shouldn't have even been able to FIND that car let alone drive it. The local PD should have seen me wandering in the thick of morning traffic with a car key in my hand and a perplexed look on my face! Sure enough though, the car was there, it was parked kinda funny and the windows were down, but it was there. So at this point I realized I was really hungry, got myself a greasy lunch/dinner and went home and to bed.
