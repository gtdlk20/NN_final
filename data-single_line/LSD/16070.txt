At this point I was in no condition to just 'chill' with people. I asked my friend's J and C to take me back to my dorm room. On the walk there I could barely understand what was going on. Everything looked like a terrifying jungle to me, and everyone struck me as so disgustingly ego-centric that it made me insanely depressed. After finally getting to my room, my trip really pulled into high gear. I experienced something I have never felt on any other drug. It was as if my memories were literally tied to my mouth. Every time I spoke or moved my mouth, it was not my mouth that moved, it was a memory that was evoked. At one point I yelled that I didn't feel well, this evoked a memory from my childhood when I lost my favorite jacket. It was literally like I could experience a memory on demand with my mouth, they were literally cross-wired.
