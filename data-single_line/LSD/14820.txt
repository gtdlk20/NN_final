We arrived at the gathering at early morning Monday and was happy to be awake and decided to set up camp prior to the hot Nevada sun became too overwhelming. My friends had a geodesic dome made out of metal conduit and it was a bit of a chore to get the structure together. Geodesic domes are basically built out of three different lengths of pipes all neatly arranged into stars and pentagons following a intricate pattern downloaded from the internet. After finishing the top three layers we decided to call it morning and sleep for a bit. The next morning we made some food, rested and tried to stay in the shade that we had created from the 3/5ths partially finished dome. As the day turned evening we once again set out to finish our shelter for the week.
