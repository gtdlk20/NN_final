My words are slowed, my articulation is vaporizing, inhibitions settling in like rigamortis. Will I be able to finish? Will I be able remember that lesson I learned? Persevere. Nothing else matters. Persevere to the end. Until you reach the end, it is left unfinished. Unfinished things are lost. We have to finish, even if this is getting sloppy and sour, I have to keep pressing on, otherwise, this will be lost, and this lesson wont settle in my bones and take hold in the constant growing person I am and will be. This trip wont become nearly as meaningful if I dont finish. It doesnt matter what you write, just write, persevere.
