It was just interesting to see the same strugglings that I have been through, evidenced in these two, and to provide the chill space where one could just deal with it. I'm not trying to sound like an elitist bastard (albeit I am one), but I take the lessons from LSD to my heart, and they do help me integrate my reality and how I interact with it.  My presence of mind is greatly aided by a dissolution of self and the reconstruction of intent and structure. It was refreshing to see where I had come from, and where my mind and self have developed since then.  Not to say it's not possible for me to get caught in the same spirals, they're always there.  It was just fun to play the observer.
