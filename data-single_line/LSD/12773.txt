Eventually I went back to the room to watch the movie more but I couldn't handle being in my head so I told Delyriem I had to talk.  We went in the kitchen and I told him I was in a bad place in my head.  He tried to comfort me but somehow he still seemed far away. I didn't know what to talk about, I tried to explain how I was feeling but because my mind still didn't make any sense.  I don't remember much else about being there, but eventually B said he'd drive us back.  I remembered then that he was really drunk, and said that we could walk back.  A few minutes later though I was in the car, forgetting again that he was drunk.  We got back into Delyriems room, the first time since we left that I felt in a familiar place.  I knew where I was and it seemed a little more normal.  I thought it was about time that my trip was over, and I was hoping it would settle down soon.  I kept trying to explain what I had been feeling to Delyriem, but as I would explain I would get stuck in my head again and would become afraid.  I didn't know if it would ever be normal again. I was close to tears a few times, uneasy about everything that was going on.  I wanted to sleep, but my mind wouldn't calm down.  I tried to sleep a few times but would jolt back awake in terror after a few moments of restless sleep.  I was laying next to Delyriem and wanted to be cuddling with him but I felt exhausted and couldn't get enough energy to pull him close to me.  He was clearly worried about me and kept apologizing about me having a bad trip.  He tried to bring us back to a silly place like the beginning of our trip but it seemed clear that he was too worried about me to enjoy himself very much.
