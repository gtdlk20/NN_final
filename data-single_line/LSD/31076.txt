Back in Diannes room, we could infer what was happening from the noise. She was clearly trying to get a quickie on with Mark, Please, please, please! we heard her tender voice beg, but it was to no avail. Mark was braindead on the sleep-syndrome, and not much fun was to be expected from more time there. She then walked out and came to check up on us. She looked visibly less literally antsy and euphoric than shed been all night. And thats when I had the most sparkling, brilliant idea of the night, Lets go out, I proposed.
