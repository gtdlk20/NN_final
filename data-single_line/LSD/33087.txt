Another effect from the trip was out of control bodily movements. I lay on the couch for hours letting my mind shut off the best it can and my arm moves high across my cold face. I tend to be moving and rubbing my clothes a lot. This movement keeps me grounded throughout the duration of my experience. This lead me to become connected to the universal pulse that moves within us, in our hearts. The music playing from the TV definitely amplified this 'pulse' idea. For awhile I trick myself into thinking if I wasn't moving I'd have bad thoughts, though this subsides.  Other visual aspects included staring at the little specs and glares on the sink and having them completely cover my visual field. On the couch I trace and draw on the fabric for over an hour, with the light from the TV shading the room, while crib mobiles hang from the ceiling.
