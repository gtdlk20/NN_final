To get all the important pre-trip background info out of the way, we (me and my boyfriend) tripped inside my house, approximately at 15:00 until about 01:00 when we finally slept, but effects really started to wear out noticeably after 8-9 hours of ingestion. Psychologically my mood was in a calm, happy state, I wasn't worrying about much really, I had accomplished some important life goals and was looking forward for this experience, to enter the psychedelic world after a long time. Before ingesting the tab, we had a warm, relaxing bath and had eaten a bowl of cereal approximately 2 hours before.
