Again I entered the euphoric state I was in before, the anticipation had me giggle like a small girl as the universe aligned itself to channel its energy through me. I closed my eyes, orbs, collision, light, everything. My body felt elevated as I floated through the room, at my fingertips I could choose to enter a more euphoric state at will. I felt in total control. Tears of joy fell on my face. I could see something beautiful.
