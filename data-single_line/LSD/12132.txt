i've been taking psychedelic drugs for ten years, and i feel like i have a pretty good relationship with them.  i got over a bad trip.  i've never lost control.  but i've always taken quite a lot.  at least a couple of hits.  this was different.  it was more like regular consciousness.  i made drawings and they were actually good.  i recorded some music and it was recognizable as such later on.  conversations made total sense.  but it was all psychedelic.  just not so perfectly removed from the regular everyday brain state.  it has enabled me, since then, to reconcile the two ways of thinking, and to adopt a more psychedelic aproach to life.
