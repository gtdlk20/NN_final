We left our room shortly after that, wrapped in blankets and using short bursts of our lighters to guide us through the pitch black and on our walk. We crossed a large paddock and took rest on the side of the grassy dam embankment for a cigarette. It was shortly after this that the clouds parted and the full glory of the night sky was revealed, it was then that nature seemed to call forward our coming trip and we all simultaneously lay back in astonishment, mouths open barely believing what was happening. Then we looked at each other and began to laugh, we stood up, the heavy wind took hold of our blankets and it felt like we were taking in everything at high speed, a huge smile was spread across our faces. We walked up the embankment to reveal the huge volume of water that was behind us all along, dully lit by the stars.
