45 We are in complete darkness. My friend Rob brings out LED flashlight from this huge bag and hands us all some glow sticks. We turn on the light and crack all the glow sticks. At this moment I knew that we were about to start tripping. I look down the tunnel and it started stretching and I kept moving farther and father away. I snap out of it and realize it was all in my head. We start walking down this dark tunnel by flashlight looking at all the graffiti bombings on the walls. Most of them were very well done and the colors of it all was very vivid the red looked red-er, black looked darker then normal if you know what I mean.
