In the bathroom, the lights were out but just enough candle light came in for me to make out the fixtures.  Within seconds, my mind was tricked into thinking that the walls and doors had become some sort of 'ice'.  I started thinking of how get out, but then figured out where the door was and proceeded back down the hall to rejoin the group.  The group I came back to had been rapidly accelerating as well.  We joked about how crazy this was already becoming within 20 minutes of ingestion.  Little did we know.  The next hour or so are pretty vague in my memory.  First of all, an ice storm began to rage outside (literally).  We were marvelling at how the weather was mimicking our mental meteorology.  All of a sudden, the power went out.
