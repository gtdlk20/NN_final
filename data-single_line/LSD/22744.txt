The rest of the walk is great. Now that were out of the woods entirely, my mood elevates considerably. I feel much more sociable, and there is much laughter among my companions and I. At one point, I spot a tractor ahead, coming towards us down the street, except in my current state I cannot tell that its a tractor. In fact, I have no idea what it is, just like what happened to me earlier with the locusts. My brain seems to be trying simultaneously to classify the red machine as a robot, ostrich, and police officer. Though the tractor is many yards ahead, I cower until it turns off the road.
