I started to feel it a little before I went over there. I think they knew what was going on, or at least that I was on something. They probably just thought I was high. Anyways, the gitteryness had already passed at the other person's house...I mean, it was still there but I was into the other things, just feeling enhancment. What we did that night I don't know, but it was like our minds and souls were melded together. Time didn't exist...I kept drifting off into this weird dream world. But at the same time I was still wired and awake with her, cuddling and doing whatnot. We didn't have sex, or any other alternatives to sex, but the whole experience was better than sex can ever be normally. It was heaven...what I felt couldn't be described. This was my first acid trip, it is too hard to explain.
