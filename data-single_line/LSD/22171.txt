We continued into the forest, everything became increasingly alive, birds, insects, green lush filled every sight. We strayed off the path and into this wonderland, touching, observing and saying to each other how fulfilling it all was. We headed back to the room for the last time and sat and smoked and discussed, all very happy with our adventure.
