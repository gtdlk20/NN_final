Overall: The experience turned out awesome. We even ended up going to see the new Willy Wonka movie at the tail end of our trip which brought the movie up to a new level. The only problem was our timing, it sucked, never do acid just on a whim. That was so unlike me as usually I plan out drugs very far in advance. Lucky for us the cop never showed and we calmed down fairly quick, but there was a little while where we were in pure terror. Scared shitless. I have had an experience with a hospital before so now whenever something goes awry on psychedelics death is always the first thing that comes into my mind. I was fortunate enough this time that everything worked out almost majestically but not always will I be so lucky. I just thought I'd share this experience as maybe people will be able to relate.
