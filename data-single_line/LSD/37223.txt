I came up on two gel tabs....not a large dose by any means, but enough. I usually trip alone and I like to explore the interwebs. While typing I noticed I had, what looked like, a piece of cobweb floating from my fingers. Instinctively I reached to pull it off with my other hand. I could actually feel the sticky pull as I tried to remove it from my fingers. Unable to remove it I took a closer look and watched it disappear.
