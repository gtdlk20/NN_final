Dosage: Now this part is interesting, and to this day I'm still not sure exactly how much LSD was taken by me, and here is the reason.. Brandon asked me if I wanted to 'dose', and I said excitedly, 'I sure do!'. So he took a sheet of white blotter LSD out of his pocket and then out of some cigarette cellophane. He wanted to have circle shaped tabs of acid, so he had taken a paper punch and punched out the circular pieces. What remained was a square piece of paper with a bunch of holes in it. The sheet of acid looked kind of like a 'paper snowflake' that you make by folding up some paper and cutting little pieces out of it, then unfolding the paper. Brandon basically took a huge piece of this 'holey' paper, (about 1/4 of the entire sheet) and told me, 'open your mouth and lift up your tongue' so I did, and in went the acid! It must have been between 500 to 1500 ug, assuming 100 micrograms is the standard for one dose. I am guessing the amount I took was fairly high, because at the time of this trip I was already an experienced user, having tripped about 7 other times before, but never reaching the kind of intense clarity and distortion that was about to unfold in my mind.
