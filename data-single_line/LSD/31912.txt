I am a semi experienced LSD user, I have done it multiple times, and  it has always been a very enlightening experience.  This time was different, It was not a bad trip, but what I felt was that I had somehow come to an understanding of the world, and that the understanding had somehow slipped away. I dont know how to explain it, so i'll just go over the night.
