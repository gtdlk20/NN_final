Time was flying by, and before I knew it about four hours had passed since I had gotten to work. I was reaching the climax of the LSD experience soon, I could tell. The dishes needed to be washed and I didnt want to have the responsibility of making or cutting pizzas at this point, so I quickly volunteered to take care of that. The stack of large pizza trays was taller than I was, so I knew I was going to be stuck at the sink for a while. I didnt look at the clock before I started washing the dishes but Im guessing it took me a good two hours to finish. Cleaning the sinks was the best part about doing dishes that day. I used a small squeegee to get all of the water off the sides of the sinks and again saw the beautiful display of colors only seen before by the Hubble telescope. The colors intrigued me so much I spent close to another thirty or forty minutes throwing soap and water on the sides of the sink and making invisible light patterns with a dirty rag. Im sure everyone at work thought I was mentally insane that day, but thankfully nobody said anything.
