T+30 minutes: My brother, who is quite young still and I wasn't worried about, tells me that my dad is coming home at 3:00 so that he can be there when the COP comes to talk to my brother about why not to do fireworks (he was caught setting off fireworks at a school). Wow so this is awesome news to me, not only are we going to peak when my dad comes home but also we are going to be peaking with a cop in my house!!! Now the first time I did acid it literally took 2 hours to kick in and another hour to come up. Not this time though, it literally kicked in at a nice strength in under an hour. So we're like alright let's go outside! Cos it was a beautiful day outside.
