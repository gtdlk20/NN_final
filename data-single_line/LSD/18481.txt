So we drop the acid around 8pm or so.  Okay....we sit in the living room drinking a little, screwdrivers I think, and 45-60 minutes later I start to feel it.  My hands and feet start to feel slightly wet.  The carpet begins to take on an interesting texture.  We all agree that it is starting to kick in.  I remember getting up to go to the bathroom and thinking the floor was wet somehow or that my feet would go through it like water.  I drain the lizard and become entranced with the shower curtain.  It was moving, flowing like a flag in the wind.  I stare at that for a while and remember to get back to the living room.
