Before my first trip I had experimented with many drugs. I felt like I had explored the vastness of my mind to the extreme. While having many a high time, I had given up on drugs having the ability to take me to new realities. Shortly before my trip my life was in chaos. I was gaining weight, jobless, self indulgent, and utterly wasteful. My mindset was that of a curious 15 year old, yet I was 21. So this being my reality, a close friend procured some blotter.
