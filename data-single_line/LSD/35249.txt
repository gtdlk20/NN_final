About 5:30, the sunlight is starting to show a little. I feel nothing, slim says he is starting to feel it. He said he felt like he was in a rollercoaster. This was the last thing I remember him saying for quite awhile, because at that instant the sun peaked up over the hills, and my trip began explosively. The sun came up, and it was the most glorious thing I have ever seen, I heard the william tell overture throughout the suns magnificent arrival to our day. The sun radiated off waves of light in synch with every symbol crash of the symphony going on in my brain. This lasts what seemed like hours but being perfectly content with it, I didn't mind.
