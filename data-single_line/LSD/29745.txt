Upon leaving I feel quite elated knowing that I have a whole day (for usually when I trip, as long as I get up once, I feel the drug until I fall asleep; either a gift or a curse, I assume the former) to trip on acid.  I ponder what to do, and maybe due to the literature based topics I just listened to for the past 50 minutes, I decide to go home and write poetry; something I hadnÂ’t done for many months and had been meaning to get back to doing on a regular basis.  The walk home, which is roughly .75 miles, seems half as long as normal for I am lost in my own thoughts, cool visuals, and overall sounds of College Park, Maryland.
