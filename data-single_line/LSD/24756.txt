Before I went upstairs, I spoke to a group of people I didn't know who were sitting in another lighted section of the basement. I said hello and they replied in kind and asked how it was going. It was an effort to say 'I took three microdots at nine oclock and I have no idea what's going on.'. It felt to me like someone was rapidly pushing a reset button in the back of my head. Thoughts came and went, trying to hold on to them was totally useless. A young man sitting at the table replied 'That's ok, you don't have to know what's going on.'. I laughed, said thank you and went upstairs. I appreciated and appreciate that very much.
