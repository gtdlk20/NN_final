I wish I had a better idea of how much I actually took which is partially why I'm writing this report.  I had not used acid in approximately six months, and the dried up end of a vial was given to me as a gift.  The giver reported a very weak experience from the liquid squeezed from the dropper, and he assumed what remained was even less concentrated.  No preparations were made in advance, and thankfully I was at home where my roommate also was.
