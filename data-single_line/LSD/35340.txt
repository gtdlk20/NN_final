About two hours after that we all eventually came to a consensus that we wanted to go walk to the park, something that was about a 15 minute walk away. My girlfriend kept trying to say stuff like 'oh it's gone now' 'I'm not high anymore' but then I would ask 'is the sky still moving' and she would accept that she was still tripping balls. We got to the park, no body was there. My experienced friend and I were just playing this this musical xylophone thing built into the play ground. Every now and then I would hear the song from that video, and I would see the little mask guys dancing in the shadows somewhere, at first it scared me but then I realized they're nice and I started to like it. This is when my girlfriend and my new friend started to have a bad trip. They both got filled with anxiety and were super nervous for no real reason, they kept saying that someone is gonna catch us, something bad is gonna happen, even though we were just some teens at a park. I calmed them down a bit and made them start enjoying it again, but then my new friend started to black out.
