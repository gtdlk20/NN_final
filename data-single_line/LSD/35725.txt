Once I got off the trampoline, I started to feel pretty weird.  I met up with my dealer so I could buy another hit for later.  Me, him, and one other person took off on bikes.  My dealer stopped and looked at me and when he turned around he looked very wavy and he told me to give him the money.  For a second I thought he was robbing me, but of course, he was just going to get the stuff.
