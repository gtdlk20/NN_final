Anyway we had another stop off before we got back to my friends house. Where I dont know, by that stage I was nicely toasted and throughly enjoying myself. While waiting there I remember seeing a guy coming up the foot path my friend (who was also tripping, but on two papers) and I started giggling like mischievous kids. We locked the doors as if the guy was some sort of threat to us, but laughing the whole time.
