Before I met them in my room I went to one of the many shared bathrooms in my building. My school had these already trippy looking floor tiles that we all used to joke around about on the bathroom floors and walls. They now began to swirl but only when I concentrated on the toilet bowl. It was one of those out of the corner of my eye kinda things. Every time I looked at the tiles they stopped, and began swirling every time I looked back at the toilet. This kept me entertained for what seemed like 10 minutes but what was probably only 1 or 2 minutes.
