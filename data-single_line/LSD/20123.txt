The time is now 8:25am and as we leave we wonder if we are still tripping so we look at the picture of the Universe again it was still moving and bright! We go outside and flick rain drops off leaves enjoying and soaking in everything. I drive us to Chick-Fil-A where we gorge on the best food known to man but suddenly after I eat one I start to become profound on the reflections of everything created from the rain and became full. C & G were still hungry so they ordered another one and feasted away! But something happened..as I watched them eat those Chicken Biscuits I realized the pain the chicken had to go threw to make us have a happy meal. I felt disgusted and yet at the same time I felt it was a fair trade off because they taste so good.
