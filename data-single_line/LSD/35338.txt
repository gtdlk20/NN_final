So at first I didn't know what to expect, and then euphoria came. Everything was funny, and I mean everything. We just looked at dumb memes on this huge tv that was in the room and laughed our asses off for about two hours, and then shit got weird. At some point someone turned on dark side of the moon, and I was laying in bed watching the ceiling melt. My girlfriend is an artist, so she had s bunch of her pieces hug up around her room. They looked so Trippy, especially the self portraits, I thought the paper was melting off the wall. At one point my experience friend said he was seeing waves so my new friend starts explaining longitudinal and transverse waves to him, asking what he was seeing, and eventually he comes to the conclusion that he was seeing surface waves. There is a napkin with waves drawn all over it, along with the words help, night vale, and the number 17. We started watching these videos, these Trippy as fuck videos like double King, fever the ghost (source) and elephant garden. I thought they were super cool, my new friend got freaked out by them. In one of the videos there's a pair of dancing shadow guys with masks. And I swear to God I was seeing them in the corner of my eyes all day. This was the best part of the trip to me, nothing was really making sense and all that we were doing was laying on the bed or looking into mirrors. The house is actually an apartment, with two floors. We agreed to stay in her room for the peak, but I really really wanted to go outside for like 10 seconds to look at the sky, unfortunately it was a gray and cloudy cold as fuck day, so there wasn't really anything to see.
