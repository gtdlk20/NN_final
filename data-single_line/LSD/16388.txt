Every object started to leave patterns behind them when I looked around, but they didn't take any significant shape and were just stay-after images in the vision field. I just noticed that they would stay there longer than usual. About 1 hour later the alcohol effects wore off and my mind started to work again. I put in a goa-trance cd I enjoyed very much and went to lie down on my bed. It was one of my favourite cd's, Pleiadians - IFO to be exact and I had some good time listening to it and letting it drill my consciousness into the songs so deep that they almost became touchable. After about 2-3 songs I realized the acid had started to work and I felt really good of listening to the music and just analyzing every layer and shapes of sounds and the way they formed a good, working whole, many different wholes to be exact that made the song work just the way it should be working, giving good visual stimulation to imagination in the form of caleidoscopic shapes and some archetypal forms.
