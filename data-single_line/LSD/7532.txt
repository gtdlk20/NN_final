When we were back on campus Arthur and I were walking towards my dorm, talking about what we wanted to do.  I suggested we should buy snacks, but when he asked me if I felt I could handle interacting with the employees, I felt an abrupt apprehension.  I began to think I probably couldn't handle it at all, and I imagined it going very wrong.  At this moment, there was a kid in a grey hoodie with a backpack walking towards us on the sidewalk.  His hood was pulled up.  As he passed we made eye-contact, and for a moment I had the sensation that we were in a wintery, Eastern European type city; I could imagine as if there were big concrete buildings on either side of the road, and light flurries of snow falling all around in the air, and a sky blotted out with heavy white clouds.  We passed each other and the vision faded.
