There were 5 of us and we got out 5 sugar cubes and dropped 5 drops onto each. However when we got to the 5th cube we only got 2 drops out and the bottle was empty. The empty (yeah right!) bottle still had residue on the inside that you couldnt squeeze out. It was a tiny plastic bottle used for mint breath drops so I was offered to eat the bottle.  J had previously eaten another bottle and said there was a lot in there still so I cut the tiny bottle in half with a knife and chewed on it for about 10 minutes. Everyone else had there cube of 5 drops and I ate the bottle which I now guess to have easily 10 or more drops.
