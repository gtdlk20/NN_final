I ended up making it back home after awhile, and I attempted to make Ramen noodles to eat something.  As expected, this failed, and I did not have a notion of what boiling water had felt like, and I almost spilled a whole pot of it onto my hand.  I ended up eating fruit, but I was shaking from nerves about this entire experience and I vomited all over myself.  I tried to go back up to my room, as I realized no matter what environment I was in, I was going to be uncomfortable and distraught.  This was the worst part of my trip: I legitimately felt like I was dying. I attribute this to ego loss, forgetting I was on a drug, not having a trip sitter to ground me, not letting anyone know what I was doing besides my cousin, and not really having a good time.  I never ended up falling asleep that night, and I had to work the next day all day.  I had a smoothie for breakfast with my parents, but I vomited that up as well. I remember wanting to be near them, and being relieved at watching the sunrise happen the next morning. I came off my trip, but I felt so physically ass-kicked that I NEVER touched LSD again.
