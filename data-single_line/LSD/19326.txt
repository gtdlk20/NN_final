We left the house as I wanted to go to the local woods to find a cure for cancer and kill some demons as I had heard that shamans used the underworld as a means of finding cures for diseases. I looked back at my mate whos name I later found out translates into prince (what the anti christ shall be called) and his head was a pyramid and he had one huge eye at the top of the it. His long hair curled out into fractals and so did the edge of my vision. At this point I was so crazy that it all seemed very mundane. I looked up and saw the moon which seemed an infinite distance away with tunnel of clouds surrounding me and leading all the way towards it, spiraling and swilring around. Its very hard to describe as it was so intense. It was literally the best thing I have ever witnessed in my life. My mate with one eye and an unaturally huge smile said maybe if you do more than three tabs you are crazy, this just made me laugh so much. I stopped as we were walking as a tree caught my eye. The branches morphed and moved gathering together, they formed a face. I looked behind the face and it split up, I proceeded to do this a few times then grew tired of it so I stared at the face and as I did this hundreds of eyes spewed out of its own. My mate called me and we continued. At this point my hair felt like it had tentacles reaching out into space and my head was exploding and projecting my imagination into the sky, it was comprised of spirals. It was a very wierd feeling.
