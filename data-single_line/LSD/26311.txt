My grass patch called me.  I wanted to lay down and end it all.  I could not talk any more and I was expressing sadness, anxiety, fear and dumbfoundedness all at once.  Several hours of this plateau and it diminished into a state of drunkenness from keg beer.  I found myself again surrounded by friends, a beer in my hand and walking about some sort of party.  It amazed me how I eased back into reality when I thought it just a dream to only be visited.  These feelings stayed inside of me for many months afterwards.  I was certain that I had died.
