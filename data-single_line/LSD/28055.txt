With me, acid can make me devilishly-mischievous, meditatively reflectful, probingly thoughtful, reflective, serene, joyful, intensely happy, radiant of love....it tends to enhance my understanding of the cosmos. It is a way to travel to reality-prime, where things are not exactly as they appear, and things are really eternal and ordered, assuring. It is a soulful drug, a mind/spirit/soul amplifier of perception, not a body drug like the legals. It allows 'the doors of perception' to be cleansed, it reminds you you are eternal. I once feared LSD cause I thought it would take 'me' away, it would destroy 'me'. Now I know personality is indestructable, at least for those who have found 'identification'. While everything changes, 'I' will remain. Those who have done lsd may suspect it is illegal because it causes thought processes that may threaten consensus reality power, it does not promote their 'authority'. LSD is a long strange journey where you walk with yourself and get to know who you really are.
