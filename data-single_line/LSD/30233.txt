One last thing is that C's actions were something beyond him even in his normal state of mind he would never have done. It was not him at all. C was completely out of his mind. Also its not like C was this random kid from our band he was a friend that we had known for most our lives. Another thing this was not our first experience with psychedelics. We had all done LSD before even C. C one night had eaten more than an eighth of mushrooms and was the best person to trip with.
