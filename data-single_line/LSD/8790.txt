I felt complete, tranquil. I went to an empty room of my friends (gone away for the weekend)  and switched on the laptop. I went onto my facebook for some bizarre reason (not something Id bother doing on psychedelic drugs) and saw an angry, disappointed comment from my girlfriend. My mind fell apart. I felt angry, confused, and sad. This is it I said. Im going to solve everything. I wrote her a huge message, telling her how Im just a human, I can never be perfect, but despite my flaws I do my best to make her happy and I love her with all my heart. That Im sorry for everything Ive done, that relationships are built on mistakes and understanding and I beg her to talk to me. I texted her from my phone telling her to come online to MSN and to check her facebook messages. She did, surprisingly, at 11am. She read my message and felt touched by it. She began to apologize too, saying how shes sorry for always criticizing me, that she knows Im just a human, but she just needs some reassurance of my love sometimes. She told me that whenever we argue, she still always loves me and never has doubts about me. She finished it by saying shell always protect and defend me.  This made me cry so much.  Knowing I had a partner whod always be there for me and who will love me. Every little doubt I had, every fear or worry I had, just went out the window. The argument which we were having, which was pretty serious, was just solved in a matter of seconds. Both of us are confident well last as long as physically possible. I really could not be happier with the result. And to think this all happened over the internet!
