Anyway, we got outside and that's when things really started getting groovy.  We walked out to the tennis courts, and my friend was messing with us.  He saw my tripping partner Nick outstretching his hands to the sky and said 'Hey John (that's me), I need you to find me the moon.'  Though I knew he was just messing around, I felt compelled to find the moon and I delightfully skipped around until I found a pine cone, which I decided must be a moon dropping.  I then reported back with what I had found, proud of myself.
