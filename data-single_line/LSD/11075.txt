Yeah right. We made it about 100 feet before we encountered the weirdest tree ever. It was shaped like a mushroom and had no leaves and weird droopy branches. It seemed to be growing, and when I walked towards it, it moved towards me as well. This surprised me and I dodged the tree just to make sure it couldn't grab me. I spent a few moments admiring the bright and growing grass next to my feet, and then noticed that T was using one of the pieces of modern art sculpture as some kind of ergonomically designed seat. We all thought this was halarious, until we realized that the art didn't seem to be holding his weight very well. Anyway, we kept moving and got up to the main road. When we passed by my house I decided it would be a good idea to carry some water and herb with us, since I planned on staying down by the tracks for a while.
