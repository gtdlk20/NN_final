I started feeling the effects about 1 hour after we dosed. I started to get a little visual distortion and I had a noticeable energy beginning to run throughout my body.  At about the hour and a half mark I began to really feel the effects. The visuals were getting strong as the room began to breathe in a sense and B had a ton of band posters throughout the room that looked so vibrant and liquid.  My mind was running all over the place. We were listening to Phish (canÂ’t recall what song now) and the music seemed to dance all around me, like I was inside of it.
