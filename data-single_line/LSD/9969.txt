I looked out the window and it all looked so big out there. I havent been out of my house at all in literally 3 or 4 months, except for a few times with my daughters mother. I ditched most of my friends due to my anxiety that I have a hard time controlling. I just couldnt do it. My uncle continued to laugh and told me that everything would be alright and to keep purging out the negativity and thats the reason I had come to purge the negativity, the boundaries, the fear of responsibilities and maturity, and thinking to much of what other people think of me. It still didnt seem to clear to me at this point. What he said made since but he cut me short because he was at work leaving me confused and sort of upset with him.
