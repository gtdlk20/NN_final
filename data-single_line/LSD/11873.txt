03:00am - Went to bathroom.  Mental note:  Don't go in that bathroom again while tripping.  Sinks overflowing, somebody shit on the floor in the stall, puke in water-filled sinks overflowing.  Didn't especially bother me, but the fact that it didn't bothered me more, because it normally would have.
