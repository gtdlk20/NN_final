I proceeded to walk into the residence with my date.  By this point, I was tripping very hard, but still having an excellent time.  Im tripping so hard I told my date.  I wasnt sure if she knew exactly what that really meant; in fact, I seriously doubt that many others on this planet (with the exception of some, of course) understand the magnitude of an intense acid trip.
