As a consequence to this trip Connor is no longer interested in psychedelics. Ted is on the fence about another excursion into the world of LSD. Chris and I have used the fear that resulted from Ted almost losing his identity as motivation. We are now incredibly well versed on all drugs, especially those we plan on doing. Chris is very interested in tripping in the future and my insatiable thirst for psychedelics and transcendence are stronger than they previously were.
