I had bought some LSD from a friend who assured me it was very good and strong. I had really quite forgotten what the actual experience of acid was like, and I wanted to get an unambiguous dose, so I decided to take all 4 hits at once. It was early evening (8pm), my housemates had already come home and gone out for the night, so I took four hits under my tongue and swallowed the paper when I felt myself starting to get altered. As the buzz increased, it was like, 'Oh yes, I remember this. Hello. This is really it.'
