Not too much later, someone brought out the nitrous.  I took a ballon and entered the nitrous world, but with far more euphoria than I had ever experienced before.  After a ballon, I would experience five minutes of bliss listening to music so distorted by my mind that it was really something else entirely (I refer to it as the nitrous song because every time, no matter what I listen to, it turns into the same thing).  I started going through ballons like mad and ended up 'wasting' a great deal of my trip trying to work the stuck cracker.
