I am by no means a writer and some of my accounts of this story may seem hazy and Chaotic but this is the best way for me to describe this experience. I`d been Joy Trippin for like 10 or 12 years but nothing was ever quite like this. It was February of 1998. The day stared off normal enough as I woke up, grabbed for my pack of Ports and the phone. I made some calls and headed out the door by 2 in the afternoon with my friend Theresa. We made it into Austin at about 3 and went downtown to chill with some Kidz on the Drag for a few hours. Some Kid told us about a party that night so that became our goal for the evening. The party itself went off without a hitch and all was good catchin up with some Kidz I hadn`t seen in a while and doin some doses. I don`t usually make it a point to keep track of how many hits I`ve taken but I`m sure it was somewhere around 50 paper doses. At any rate I was informed before the night was over to come to this girl Heidi`s (R.I.P.)house the next day if I was gonna be in town at around 5 cause my friend Tre had somethin in mind for me.
