As we were sitting in the parking lot I tried to explain to Wally what I was feeling but he was pretty much out of it. I told him that all the beer bottles in my car and the fact that I was dirty as hell with pupils the size of quarters was making me worry. He told me to relax and that we could go to his house for a little while. This sounded like a very good idea so that's where we went.
