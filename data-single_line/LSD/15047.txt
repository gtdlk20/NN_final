Hopefully this was helpful for someone. I know a large number of the trip reports on here are focused on serious psychonautical exploration, but as I've grown older I've found my trips taking on much more of a grounded character that serves to reaffirm my beliefs and passions and help to solidify my goals and the path I've chosen to take to reach them.
