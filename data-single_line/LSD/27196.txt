Then she looked at the door and said, 'Oh, Ann is back.'  Then, I instantly transformed back into myself.  Then, we were sitting talking and every couple of minutes, Shauna would glance at the door and say, 'Ann, the door is open,' and I would look and it was closed.  I would tell her that it was closed and she would say that everytime I looked, it would close really fast then it would open again.  That started to freak me out.   So I was paranoid that someone kept opening the door.  Finally, after a while, we started to come down.  Many times, we would think that we were done tripping, and that feeling would come back.  Finally, we both fell asleep, exhausted mentally and physically.  All in all, we tripped for 10 hours.  The next couple of days, neither of us felt normal.  I have had a couple of flashbacks.  Even now as I am writing this, I can visualize each experience with great clarity.  Shauna's first trip was a great one.  And Santa Claus was an underlying theme of the whole trip.
