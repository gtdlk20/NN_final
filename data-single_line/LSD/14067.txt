T=2:45: I noticed that the fuzzy setting patterns and support marks in the concrete ceiling of my apartment had begun to intensify into something resembling densely composed Aztec writing or an angular Celtic braid pattern.  The grain of the wood of my door took on much sharper edges and more saturated colors.  It was gorgeous.  I spent a while looking around at various objects in the room.  I picked up an abstract bronze sculpture and twirled it around in my hands.  I wondered whether I would hallucinate it melting or merging with adjacent objects (this never did happen, oddly; I was always able to perceive it clearly).  I went to my computer and moved the mouse around and saw some visual trails of its path, but didn't it always do that?  (It did, though not so strongly.)  I got back in bed.  I wondered whether the 5th tab had been a mistake....  In retrospect I should have been wondering about the 4th and perhaps the 3rd as well. I wondered whether the 5th tab had been a mistake....
