Anyway, we dosed at my friend's house and went to a local park. It was outside of town and extremely beautiful; the perfect place to exclude yourself from the awful townspeople. The acid was from a Rusted Root concert; my friend had brought it back. Pyramid blodder with the most intricate detailing I had ever seen on an LSD inpregnated piece of paper. It took about 30 minutes to take over my mind. I was soon seeing all kinds of imaginary vines coming out of the swirling patterns on the floor of the picnic shelter where we were sitting. Soon we were all tripping our balls off and decided to go to the 'trippin' tree'. The trippin' tree is a tree that I smoked weed at on 4/20 the previous year. I was tripping on liquid that day. Just by chance.
