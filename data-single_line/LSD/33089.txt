The hours that followed were somewhat zombie-like. I presumed this to be the 'comedown'.  I woke up my friend to ask if I could go watch the sun rise on his back porch. The screen doors were left open so I was welcomed with fresh air and a chilly temperature. I wander around viewing the rising sun and just explore around in his backyard. I head back inside and wrap a big blanket around me on the couch. I let the hours pass as I feel a bit burned out and sweaty, fairly aware of my altered mindset. I concluded that Acid can really hurt my brain if I try to gain control, it's like my conscious will try to push Lucy out of the driver's seat and it will disturb her greatly. Every time I thought 'I'm on acid right now?! I didn't really need to do this did I!?' I'd feel a pinch in my brain and readjust myself.
