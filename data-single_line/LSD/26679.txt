It was only later coming down that things got really interesting.  Mostly down, I went to wander around outside in the dim predawn light.  I ended up lying down next to a fountain and telling myself that, like the Buddha, I would not move until I experienced a revelation (I had been reading a lot about LSD and religious experiences).  Trying to concentrate my mind on religious issues, I sat there for about 15 minutes.
