It was now about 10pm, and we were still peaking, heading home in a car. They dropped us off a block from my house, and made us walk in the dark.  I remember walking up the street and seeing big cracks in the ground, and orange stuff coming out of the cracks, almost like lava. The trees around us were spiraling up high in the ski, and were white with little color on it. Everything had seemed so detailed. Finally we had arrived in my house.....
