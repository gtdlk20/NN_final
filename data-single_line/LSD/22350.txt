The visuals began to become very intense and I saw my whole room begin to breathe. I started to understand the feeling my boyfriend barely managed to describe, indicating it by doing wave patterns with his arms and hands. However, the visuals also had an adverse effect on me. I became nauseated and dizzy and I had severe stomach cramps. I felt restricted in my clothing and felt very hot. I stripped off of what I could of my clothes while staying decent and complained of how I didn't feel very well. My friend C tried to convince me not to focus on it and my boyfriend insisted on me 'letting go' but I told them they didn't understand how badly my stomach hurt and how terribly this mixed with the visual effects I had. my boyfriend insisted on me 'letting go' but I told them they didn't understand how badly my stomach hurt and how terribly this mixed with the visual effects I had.
