I was only resting for about 10 seconds before I caught some movement in the corner of my eye.  I saw the ceiling moving, taking on a flowing form, as if it was silk being blown by the wind.  Being the first visuals I had ever experienced, I was awe-stricken.  I sat and watched the movement spread onto more surfaces, noticing that the movement was stronger whenever I looked. I could see movement in the corner of my eye, but only when I looked directly at something would it shift and dance. After staring at the floor for several minutes, I decided to return to my friends.  'D,' I said. 'Are you feeling anything?' He gave me a blank look and cracked a smile at me.  His pupils, almost completely dominating the blue of his eyes, were all I needed to see.
