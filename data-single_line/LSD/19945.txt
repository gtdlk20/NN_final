After about 35 minutes I was experiencing and intensity I have never felt before.  When I saw the frame of the house that was being built bending in pinching itself until either sides touched, I knew I may have done something wrong.  Going inside to my room with three other friends to listen to music the intensity was increasingly more more and overwhelming the more I recognized it.  As we go inside we turn on the music, we all lie down to stare at my painted ceiling and walls with glow in the dark stars all over the room.  Everything I had seen was roughly normal considering I had only eaten at most 3 hits at one time until this.  Again, everything was about normal until I peaked.
