I think I should mention there were two beds on the room, positioned parallel to each other, with a vast walking space in the middle. I sat on the left side, on Diannas roommates bed (whose name I forget, as she wasnt there that night), while Summer had been chilling on Diannas mattress, which was so messy that I think part of it might have been exposed. Still, not any messier than my mattress.
