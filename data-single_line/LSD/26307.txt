My friend, (who was on the same dosage, but not tripping as hard as me), took me to a hill with a rocky outlook.  From that vantage point I saw mist and low clouds begin to sweep across the tree tops.  It looked like rain was to come.  We sat and I told my friend that the trip was too intense and I wanted to live no longer.  I looked up and saw unusually low fog blowing from left to right across the tree line.  The fog took the tops of trees right off and scattered them in the air I imagined it looked like a dandy lion would when blown upon, sending airborne chutes aloft.
