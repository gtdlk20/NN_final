All was pretty much the same for the rest of the night. I guess I fell asleep at around 6:00 am and woke at 10:00 am. It didnÂ’t feel like I had slept at all, just missing time. I have to say, I will always remember this, although it was really screwed up, I have had more pleasant trips. This just felt as if some sinister force was controlling it, controlling my mind. I guess that would be my society. We later came to the decision that what we wanted was to be sober. Thank God for that.
