The next day I could barely talk. I was simply shattered from the experience. As I slowly gained my strength over the course of the morning, I began to realize the blessing that I had experienced; I had a new respect for my life, just *being* had a new meaning for me. As of now, I am exhausted, but I feel good for getting this off of my chest. I haven't had any experiences with LSD after that night, I feel like I've been there and felt the true effects of the drug.  Future exploration is likely if I can find a good source, but where I live it is damn near impossible.
