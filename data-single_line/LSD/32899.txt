Man, it was the strongest trip everyone had ever had. As I was the most drug hungry, I took twice more than them. It was sometime at night already, and we were being very noisy with the music playing really loud and everyone screaming to talk to each other. The new sensations and thoughts we becoming more apparent and we perceived quickly that something was changing. We were all going mad. At some point I forgot I had taken the drug.
