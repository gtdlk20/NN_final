I get behind his piano and fiddle around, really try to get my pent up music energy out. At this point I understand this 'at home' feeling I've read about. Every other moment feels welcoming, like a new perspective has brought me warm hospitality. Now close to 4am I lay on the couch in my friends basement while he rest on the couch a few feet away. I put on some of my favorite music including bedroom pop like Starry Cat and some Explosions In The Sky. Visually, I found myself lost in the album covers on the tv screen. It was like one still frame was a whole psychedelic masterpiece. if I notice a certain pattern, it tends to be repeated and repeated. I can somewhat control where my visuals take me.
