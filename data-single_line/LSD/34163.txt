The birthing process brought me closer to oneness.  I had a hard time re-entering my body.  Everything turned to ones and zero's and negitive one like on the internet.  I actually felt like The planet had a big net over it and to re-enter I had to go through it.  Very unpleasent in a digital way.  The most interesting thing happened to me after this experience.  My eye color changed for three days.  I have green eyes and after this experience I had bright piercing electric blue eyes.  People around me were commenting as well as my boyfriend.
