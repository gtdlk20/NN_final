These people had no idea I was tripping, and invited me to ride with them and smoke. We got into the van and left campus to smoke in the wind and rain. I informed them of my level of intoxication and consumed the last two hits. They put on some music, and I became lost in it......it went around and around, in and out, through me. We smoked a couple grams of dank between four people, and this amplified the LSD.
