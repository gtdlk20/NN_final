Then I came across a kind of natural amphitheater where people were camped out for the night, and I settled in. There was some brief acoustic guitar from the stage that was the bottom of the amphitheater. Someone told me the next day that it was Jorma K, but I never found out if it indeed was. So Im settled in, drifting in and out of some trippy thoughts, when someone yells I need a shovel, with some faint echoes bouncing off the trees (or my somewhat handicapped ears!).  A few minutes later I need a shovel, and  then I need a f**ing shovel, someone get me a shovel. Im not sure how long his pleas went on, but finally someone yelled What do you need the shovel for?, and the first guy giggles Uhhhh.I forgetand everyone in the amphitheater laughed in unison.
