The LSD took about half an hour to come on.  I sat watching the river for a while and became immersed before going out to the old growth forest to watch the trees.  I had never seen this before - they were pulsing and bulging in and out and I could see green auras around them.  I became aware of my primate side, the side that knows instinctively how to connect to the earth - the side that knows how to survive if everything fell apart tommorrow.  Funnily enough it made a lot more sense when I had all four limbs on the ground like an ape.  I definitely had a better connection with the earth when my hands which I know so well were literally connected to the earth.
