Now I am in a dark underground cave.  There are many people here.  We are all dead.  A huge crowd of dead people, standing around, frowning. It feels sketchy here.  Not like we are in Hell, but this is not a nice place.  I think, 'This is Sheol.'  It's like a waiting room.  I want to leave. It's like a waiting room.  I want to leave.   But you're not allowed to.  There are these monsters guarding us.  They look like big disembodied mouths, with snaggly teeth, drooling slime and blood, hovering above the ground.
