At eight pm I bit the top off the dropper and chewed on it while I reconstituted the dropper with water and drank it all.  I repeated this twice more to be sure nothing was left behind, and then went about some household chores.  One half hour later I felt abruptly disoriented, with a perceived loss of balance.  For fear of falling over and hurting myself I sat down on my couch as the room started to spin out.  Within a half hour of the onset I had reached what I would later realize to be the peak.  I was sweating so profusely that it was pouring off of my face and I could collect it in pools in the palms of my hands. I experienced intense visual, and auditory hallucinations.  Mentally speaking the only uncomforting thing was that I didnt know how deep I was going to be going until I had began to come down.  Because this was my first and only encounter of this magnitude I felt a good deal of anxiety in the sense of not knowing at the time if I was going to be alright afterwards.  These feelings along with the intense perspiration subsided with the most intense part of the trip in about one hour.  Even then I wouldnt call it a bad trip.  (I can imagine feeling similar anxiety if I were to try skydiving for the first time. In that sense I see it as a potential personal fear of radically knew experiences. Although I might have felt scared at the time I would consider it one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had.)
