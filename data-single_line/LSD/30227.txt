After about three hours of trying to keep C silent we decided something was incredibly wrong so while me and B tried to sit in the room an calm C down, A went to get his dad. A told his dad that C was freaking out and we didn't know what to do. We had told his Dad that C had taking LSD without us knowing and we did not. When A's brother came home he had to man handle C down to A's basement so C wouldn't brake anything. As we sat there watching C literally go insane and talking complete gibberish, A's dad called drug control and they told him to call a ambulance because we had no idea wat he was capable of.
