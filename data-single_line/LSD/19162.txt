My friend C ended up taking his hit a few days before J and I, and I spent the day with him to see how he reacted.  His trip seemed very mental, though just from smoking weed with him on a regular basis I knew he often ended up in his head while I tend to be enthralled by how things look and sound and was expecting a very different trip than the one he had.
