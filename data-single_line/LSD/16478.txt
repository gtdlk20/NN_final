When she got out we spent time exploring the store.  We finally got a call back from our friend 'Lavinia' when leaving, but we weren't really able to talk very well at this point.  We had a much easier time understanding each other than making others understand us.  It should be noted that while my visual experience was possibly more pronounced, I did not seem as effected in the area of speach.  I spoke with a bit more clarity than Entheogen throughout.  We went on to visit our friend Leary at his place of employment, a fast food joint.  Here Entheogen wished we had a floating camera to follow us and chronicle the day.  But she also explained that she felt like a camera herself, and I understood her to mean that she seemed to be taking the world in like one, an observer recording the universe.  I've seen this sentiment in other experience reports actually.
