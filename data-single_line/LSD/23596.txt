By now it was approximately 4am, maybe later, and I decided I'd trip again. Cheryl advised against it, but I took about 1/4 of the paper's original size, and just dissolved it directly on my tongue. We then turned on the TV and were transfixed on a Madame Cleo Psychic Hotline infomercial (or maybe travel packages to Jamaica??)
