T=3:40: I was abruptly reincarnated as something genderless and alien, prostrated in a ritual to Lovecraftian alien 'outer gods'.  My body seemed alien to me; I felt unfamiliar with its structure.  I could suddenly tangibly perceive the philosophical absurdism of Camus and live within it.  I had always believed it intellectually, and if I stared at e.g. my hand long enough I could begin to perceive how absurd and how arbitrary the structure of the human body was (compared to any given alternative evolutionary possibility), but here and now I was living it and perceiving it fully.  The fixtures and trash can in the bathroom appeared to be covered in vertical columns of alien writing made of thin lines and triangles that glowed and sparkled in pulsating pastel blue and orange and yellow.  Another few cycles of reincarnation across alien genders and species, still with this strange religious overtone, this ritual prostration.  (I was still on the floor or kneeling.)  The mantra repeated over and over in sync with the successive reincarnations.  It was fascinating.  I felt as though I had greatly advanced in my understanding of absurdism.
