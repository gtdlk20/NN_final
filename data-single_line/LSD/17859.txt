Summer Thoughts: "So, Valk summed this stage up for me pretty well. The majority of my thought loops at this point were along the lines of What if I never stop tripping and Im stuck in this helpless state forever? and Does the sober existence I keep trying to reassure myself of actually exist, or is this all something I am making up in the moment? Does the sober existence I keep trying to reassure myself of actually exist, or is this all something I am making up in the moment? I was almost certain, for what seemed like an eternity, that Summer did not exist and never has. I completely lost touch with myself, and had begun talking about myself in third person. I never felt like anyone else, but I certainly didnt feel like myself either. I remember thinking over and over that I just want this to end. It was miserable."
