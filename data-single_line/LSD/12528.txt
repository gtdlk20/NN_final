It was only slightly later, on the way to the park, when it happened. The other voice  the one that had talked to me back outside my apartment  started speaking to me again. Only it wasn't in audible sound; it was in the form of a thought, but a thought I myself wasn't consciously generating. I felt a great sense of love  maternal love. And the thought repeated over and over in my mind This is the very beginning; you can always return to this state.
