That was one of the most pleasant days of my life.  We didn't climb Mount Everest, or go over Niagara Falls.  We didn't have sex with super models or party with Motley Crue.  We just had a nice time and learned a lot about ourselves in the process.  This was what I was missing before.  Drugs aren't some sordid little toy, there something that should be shared, with family and friends.  Like a picnic at the park, or a summer BBQ there a way to have a nice time and learn about yourself and loved ones.
