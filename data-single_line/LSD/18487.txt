Back inside we head to S's room, at least that's the next thing I remember clearly.  He has a pink light and purple light in the light/fan and a black light on in the corner.  He has a bunch of cool ass posters.  He had a 'Lord of the Rings' poster, the border has vine, trees, and characters from the book was moving around the picture.  Gandalf was in 3-d, things were moving and it blew my mind.
