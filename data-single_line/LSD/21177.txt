12:45a.m - After standing in a circle for an hour and 15 minutes we decided to just sit down and watch ' Alice in Wonderland '. When the movie started we paused it at the begining , when its a picture of the pond with ducks and flowers everywhere - and played some music. It was unbelivable. I love music when I am sober , but there is nothing like listening to it on LSD. I closed my eyes and it felt like I was standing front row at there concert , i could see the music playing in my head. I began to stand up and dance around.
