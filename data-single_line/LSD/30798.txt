We were sober-sat by Louise (though she prefers sober-played-with), and her sort-of-boyfriend Frey, who I went to high school with. Louise is Diannas suite mate, who shares the apartment in the dorm with her, and she was there as we dropped in Diannas room. We were meant to originally do it in Summers room, but her roommate (who isnt too fond of psychedelic substances) was there, and Diannas place was bigger anyways.
