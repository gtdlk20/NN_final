I actually wanted to point it out but he pointed it out first. Weve had this before on mushroom trips where we are mumbling but still able to understand each other because were both thinking about and seeing all the same things anyways. He was saying Its so cool how you can just..look at the all the trees and leaves but.. also.like..look beyond..that.. and it sounds very vague but I knew exactly what he was talking about and he was describing it perfectly. How when you look at the patterns of the leaves on the trees you can look further and further into it like your perception is a microscope/kaleidoscope and you can see even more patterns of leaves inside of those initial real patterns that were there and visible to everyone. So impossible to describe or imagine. I couldnt even wrap my head around it while it was happening. I couldnt NOT see kaleidoscopes, I had no control. My friend also proceeded to say Its crazy how in a few hours we wont feel like this and hes right it was. It felt like I was gonna be like this forever, not stuck or anything I mean maybe stuck ya but it was more just the feeling like wow I couldnt imagine ever not seeing the world this way since this is more real than..wellmore real than normal reality. I cant unlearn or unsee any of this. How will my mind ever return back to how it was and pretend like everythings normal? I felt I plugged so deep in my head it just didnt make sense that I would somehow eventually drift back or come back down to normal 3 dimensional reality and consciousness.
