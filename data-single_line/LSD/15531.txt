Other less stimulating pictures would appear far away only to race up towards my eyes and become what appeared to be about 5 times larger than they were when I first looked at them. The other amazing thing was when I found the mirror in my bathroom, it was me but then again it wasnÂ’t. Imagine a thousand photographs of your face are taken from the front but each one at a slightly different angle, left, right, up, down. Then play all the shots back to yourself at about five every second and that is how I saw myself in a mirror. It was interesting but a tad unnerving at the same time.
