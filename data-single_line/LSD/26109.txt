The trip was a wonderful journey, one which had an immense impact on my life.  Since being introduced to this divine world, my outlook on life changed.  Beauty of everyday life made its presence know to me long after the trip was over.  I learned to see the extraordinary in the ordinary.  In other words, LSD was my window to a heavenly bliss, which in many forms persisted and embodied itself in life as I know it.
