As his breakdown was increasingly intensifying, communication between us was becoming more and more difficult and since I was just as loaded as he was, forming coherent sentences and soberly reacting to the situation and thinking in linear logic was a great challenge. We eventually ended up at his grandparents grave in a cemetery on Mount Royal. At this point he was becoming increasingly paranoid and suspicious of me. He later told me once we were back to baseline that at that point he was perceiving me as Satan who was trying to keep him in the human game of mundanity and suffering and prevent him from mustering all the courage and bravery in him to use this very special opportunity to climb to the top and leap into and take off with the solar wind, as he was then incoherently and graspingly describing it. Kneeling on his grandparents grave, he then proceeded to murmur a prayer Is there any remover of difficulties save God? Say praised be God. He is God. All are His servants and all abide by His bidding, over and over and over again, him being a very open minded adherent of the Bahai Faith.
