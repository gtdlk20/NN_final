I have not yet put the key in the ignition and C points this out.  'Oh I just wasn't going to drive until someone made me' I reply. 'Drive' commands C.  I drive.  Confused I tell C that its his job to tell me exactly when and where to turn for the entire drive back home.  With much difficulty and confusion we exit the Cedar Point Parking lot.  I have almost no visuals anymore and just have a strange head buzz that makes me feel somehow 'different' but not very messed up.
