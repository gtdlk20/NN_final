10:00pm. I was a bit nervous, so I decided to only take one of the two hits I had, and take the other if I wasnt tripping that hard in like an hour. My heart was racing as I put the little piece of paper in my mouth, but once I did, it all subsided. It didnt taste like anything, but it felt strange, almost tingly and cold on my tongue. The journey begins here. I sat talking with my friend for a little while, looking around at everything in the room, I remember thinking, in about two hours, this place is going to look very different. I had no idea how right I was. After about 45 minutes had passed, I was feeling really good. I had a nice body high, and the music sounded great. I couldnt tell if it was the acid, or if the lightshow was just really trippy, but I didnt care, I was having a good time. At this point I was still having normal conversations with my friend, N, and other people in the bar, but I couldnt help but notice that everyones faces looked very three-dimensional, and almost plastic-like. We went outside to check out the other band, and they were awesome too. It was really hot inside, so we chilled outside listening to the other band for a while. I was really high at this point, but I wasnt having any hallucinations, and I was still concretely in this world, so I decided to take the other hit.
