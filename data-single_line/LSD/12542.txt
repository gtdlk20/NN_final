I finally made my way to the lake. It was early afternoon, and the sun was reflecting off it. The reflections were amazing. It's hard to explain. Physically it looked more or less the same. But I perceived it as more . shiny I suppose. As if the light was somehow brighter than it actually was, in a soft but sharp way. Brilliant, but without glare.
