At around 10 o'clock, I went with a different friend to the dance, because the game had ended. I took my trusty glowrod, and took off my shoes. In the gym, I talked to many people and continued to twirl the glowrod. Its mystical green light entranced me, and my friend decided it was time to leave. I had thought we had been there about five minutes, but it was actually more like 45. We left, got in the car, and cruised around looking for a party. I was content to sit and listen to selected tracks from Tool, Sublime, and some other groups I can't recall now.
