I sat there, totally unable to move for an indeterminate amount of time, watching the night silently explode with color and life.  Beauty enveloped me, rolled over me like a wave.  The clouds began to race across the shining orange surface of the moon, surrounding it in a halo of the purest gold.  This gold light bounced off the surface of the water, lending an silver gleam to every moist blade of grass.  The night itself seemed to beckon me, it was totally engrossing.  I watched and I walked, but I didn't speak, not wanting the spoken word to mar the beauty of the night world.  I wandered for a while, oblivious to both the growing coolness in the air and the emptiness of my stomach.  I didn't seem to need food, the night provided more than enough to sustain me.  I wandered for hours, thinking of many things, and basking in the beauty of the night.
