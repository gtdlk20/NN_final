I was young at the time, and my parents had gone away for the weekend, so two friends and myself each took one dose (blotter paper) of acid.  We took the stuff in a forest near my house.  It was midsummer, and where I live, it doesn't get fully dark till about eleven.  We sat around for an hour or so, until dusk had set in, but nothing was happening to me and not much to them, so we decided to head back to my house.  Another friend who hadn't taken anything came back too.
