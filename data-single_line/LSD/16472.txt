I had the desire to explore the universe, so I fianlly let go my inhibitions and agreed.  Our first stop along the way was at the nearby let's call it a 'low-price superstore', the kind of place where you can get groceries, clothing, household supplies, small electronics, or even get your car serivced in minor ways.  Anyhow, the second most humorous part of the whole day was as we were walking up and I was looking at a family standing outside. I am never normally one to think this, but their baby was UGLY.  When we got inside, I told Entheogen and of course we spent a rediculous amount of time just inside the side entrance laughing hesterically.
