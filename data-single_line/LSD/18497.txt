I remember sitting on S's bed staring at the ceiling with D, the pink tropical light was on, the ceiling fan was on full blast so you could feel the air moving and it made the light move on the ceiling a bit, and the track with the lightning from the TOOL album was playing. I thought I was on an island before a storm.  I felt at peace, and I never wanted to leave.
