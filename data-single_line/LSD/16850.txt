I got up and walked out of the room, and started to make my way down the stairs.  I got about halfway down, and began to feel dizzy.  I sat down on the stairs, put my head in my hands and closed my eyes.  I remember having a short conversation, like an argument, with who I could not tell you.  I said 'No, not yet' and they agreed with me, that it was not the right time.. and suddenly, I felt as if I was being pulled from my body.  Further and further back I was pulled, I could see the house and then the city, then the state... but stranger still, I was aware of all the people, things, animals, and that they were all interconnected, like a huge puzzle fitting together in perfect symmetry... and then I stopped.
