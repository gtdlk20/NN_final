I stopped, turned around, and then slow jogged back down the driveway and into the residence.  The reality is, everyone at the party had just witnessed me sprint through the house as fast as possible for no apparent reason (which, later described by my friend Jeff, was the fastest he had ever seen a human run).  From my perspective, though, the reason I had run was legitimate.  I truly believed that I had to get out of sight (or perhaps I didnt really think about it, for everything was intensely colorful, fast, and euphoric).  I thought that because the reason I took off running was legit, everyone who had witnessed me run was impressed by the will that I had to get out of sight.  I felt like a prophet.  I thought that everyone thought that I was badass for running so unbelievably fast to get out of sight. I refer to these delusions as delusions of grandeur.  The LSD propelled me into an extremely delusional state in which I felt superior and prophetic. The LSD propelled me into an extremely delusional state in which I felt superior and prophetic.
