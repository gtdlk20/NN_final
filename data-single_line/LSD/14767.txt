We were sort of still looking for a nice place to find some rest but apparently this party didnt have a permit for a camp fire so there wasnt any place that wasnt either over crowded or very cold. While walking around I heard bird sounds that were equally fractalised as my entire surrounding. The world was a psychedelic painting that went through all my senses. The world was a psychedelic painting that went through all my senses. A few strangers attempted a fire anyway but it only lasted for about 15 minutes as people came to put it out even quicker then it took the people to make the fire in the first place. Here another visual peak of the trip came. I realised at some point just staring into the space that each time Id blink the world would be sort of reset, and the visuals would start again from the real world. I decided to not blink for a while and see what it would do. My theory proved to be true as while I kept my eyes open the trees would move further apart and become much more fractalised. From time to time everything got really blurry, then moved extremely fast and became extremely sharp. New patterns started shaping in between the trees and then I kind of had to blink because my eyes got a little dry so I went for a second try.
