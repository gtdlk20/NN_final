T 5:30-7:00 - I go to smoke a few more bowls to try and get back up.  It works surprisingly well.  I decide to make a fire cause it was getting chilly in my humble abode.  As I look into the fire, I see tremendous colors, brilliant and vibrant colors, colors that I didn't know existed.  The flame turns solid gold and I am absolutely enthralled by the whole experience.  I watch a little while longer then retreat to my room to play guitar.
