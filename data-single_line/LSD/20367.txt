The next thing that happens is I come to the very end of my neighborhood still not at my house and dont really feel high or anything at least not that I could tell, I didn't even feel the weed but my tolerance was high so I wasnt really thinking about it. Anyways I didnt feel like I was on anything or maybe just forgot I was but Im just sitting on this stone wall in front of these houses texting my OTHER friend who lives down the street from me who is actually like a real friend and hes the one I trip with the most. I dont remember if I told him to come out and take this other hit of acid or if I was just seeing what he was doing and if he could hang out but as Im sitting there (and I swear this happened exactly like in a movie or something) this random pitbull just comes out of nowhere and began inspecting the area Im around including me and is sniffing all around and then a little while later I stand up and the dogs owner who is this lady who lives right next to there comes from her driveway and looks very surprised and says Whoa come here boy (the dog), wow Im surprised he didnt maul you or start barking like crazy and then she starts laughing and this weird vectorial feeling took place in my mind while all these physical motions and events started to happen in this strange order and consistency. She was just very curious as to why the dog wasnt barking or going crazy. She told me she had seen me around before and wondered who I was and we both struck up what would then be a pretty long and immersive conversation. It first started out with me walking over there and facing her over on the side of her driveway but facing away from her house and her driveway. There was a black gate behind me and a tree on the sidewalk in front of me across from the gate and she was standing in front of the tree and I was facing her direction which was the direction of the dark street. This is when things got crazy.
