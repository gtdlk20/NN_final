The night before, a Tuesday evening, a friend was able to find some acid and sell it to me.  Promptly thereafter I proclaimed that I planned to eat it the next morning about half an hour before my American Literature class at 11 a.m.  I would mainly attribute this impromptu reaction to my friendÂ’s ability to sell me acid very late into the night before the class to my lack of acid the previous 2 weeks.
