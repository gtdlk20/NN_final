After a slightly panicky ride of twenty minutes or so, we arrived at Mike's deserted house, at which point we took the second hit. I just felt weird for about a half hour or so. I could tell when it kicked in, because I had been dancing with glostix and Mike left the room, and I told him he didn't want to hang with the glostick reject and then I burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter. I can still feel that cold ass tile floor against my back, and there I was, just cracking up. I finally managed to get up and go into the guest bathroom. The counter was moving in all sorts of awesome patterns, and for the longest time I just stared at it in marvel, occasionally laughing nervously.
