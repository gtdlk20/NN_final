When the effects started kick in, my boyfriend was playing video games and I was internet surfing. Gradually I started noticing some changes in the lights, it was as if someone had been messing with the the brightness, turning it higher on. My head felt warm, as if I was sick (I wasn't) and my heart was racing. I also felt very nauseous, but I didn't throw up. Then, I got up from the sofa and started browsing around the house. Body felt heavy and visually I could see light trails, but no distance or size distortion, as in, objects did not seem further, longer etc from what I originally perceived them to be. Colours seemed more vibrant and looking outside the world had an 'electric' feel to it, sometimes my vision would get blurry by all the objects' trails, but in general everything was visually crisper, like my vision jumped to high definition.
