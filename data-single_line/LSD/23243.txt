The following day was a Sunday. I share a room with my brother so I don't have much privacy. At around 9pm he said he was going to his friendÂ’s house and that he wouldn't be home until something like 4am. When he left I saw this as an opportunity to take the acid, so I dropped one hit at around 9pm on a Sunday night. Bad idea right? As I have school the next morning. I wasn't 100% sure of how long the effects lasted.
