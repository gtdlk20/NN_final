Although my first and only trip from acid was riddled with fear and darkness, it was also punctuated with mind-opening, euphoric revelations and visions. Ill definitely do it again at any given opportunity, I guess because Ive gotten the bad trip out of the way. Anything else would be a good trip in comparisonor so I thought. A month or two later, I first read others experiences with acid, and I was dumbfounded at the number of trips that were inconceivably worse than mine. This hasnt changed my decisions in the least, however, and lsd still beckons me forward.  I still feel it at the edge of my consciousness, and I cant wait for the next time.
