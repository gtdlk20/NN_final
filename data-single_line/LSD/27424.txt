 I was still an amateur at this point, only had taken sid about 3 times. Most of the summer had been spent smokin' and not doing much. I had been on the boat with two friends, had a blast and was wiped out. We got back to the house and did the usual, try and find some doja. We called this girl we knew just to talk, but she said she was busy. 'What are you talking about,' I ask and she replies 'Me and (some other weird girl) are gonna trip.' My heart jumped. 'Holy shit, can you get us some shit?' The answer had to be yes or else I couldn't tell about it. She came over with two other guys who had the whole freaking spectrum of gel, and some whack blotter. This was when geltabs were making it into the scene in my area and were quite expensive, so we settled for the Blue Moon (I was later told the dosage was around 200 mcg per hit), a blotter that had a Blue moon and some other drawing on it. The guys left and I was sitting there with five hits in my hand. I only took three (good thing) and saved some for later in the week. [Little did we know the conversation our friend had with the dealers. it went something like this: Dealer - 'your friends do a lot of acid?' Girl - 'I dont know, I guess so.' Dealer - 'Oh, well this acid is gonna kick their ass. (together) HaHaHaHa']
