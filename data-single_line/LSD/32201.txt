The visual state and my mental state seemed to be in unison during this time and the feeling was as if I was connected to the earth not as an ape as before, but as a human, but a human who could move and live on the earth in a way that I have never done before.  My posture and presence actually felt different - like another being - but it was definitely me, just me in a way that was unified with the earth.  There was something childlike, but there was also adult and animal, and throughout it all I was aware of the choice to be what I want to be.
