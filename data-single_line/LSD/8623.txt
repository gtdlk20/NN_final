So L gets this powerful thirst and were at our first point of crisis since dropping. L says he is feeling the acid a little but we need to find water really badly. We didnt bring any with us which was a big mistake as it was probably 95+ degrees out. After much deliberation we decided that we would simply walk back to the elementary school and use an outdoor water fountain. I think I really like that about acid. When I'm in trip mode I really sort of use Occams razor as a decision making process: the simplest solution is probably the best. So we walked the half mile back to the elementary school.
