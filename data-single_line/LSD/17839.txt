What Ive found amazing about acid is just how much color it can add to usually black and white only images/videos. Theres this amazing animation on YT that is black and white only but combine it with acid and it feels as if there is color everywhere in it. Like rainbow effects in every cell, every frame. Kind of like what you see looking through a prism or what it projects onto a wall. That combined with the jaw dropping soundtrack it makes for an amazing video to trip to. I ended up getting on my knees on the floor with my feet tucked beneath me, allowing all my focus to go into the video. It becomes a surreal experience, my entire world, my entire existence becomes this animation. Its an amazing thing to feel and is hyper powerful. Also watched an Alan Watts music video which is also absolutely jaw dropping. They both are great videos to come-up on as the effects are hitting me. The last video has actually made me cry it felt so emotional in the moment. As do other videos on this drug, it boosts my emotions soooo much.
