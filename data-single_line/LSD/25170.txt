At about 7 am I was able to sleep. I awoke at about 9am in a sort of dopey hangover zombie like state. My brother drove us to McDonalds to get a burger and on the way back was nearly in a serious car accident, I remember the car skidding for about 10 metres at which I put the burger up to my mouth and had a bite, the car kept skidding and narrowly missed and oncoming car which was at that point I thought 'holy fuck what just happened', Needless to say by brain wasn't quite all there yet.
