Later, before we left, another nearby camper smoked us out heavily and we traded a small bud of White Russian for a luscious, fresh, glittering green bud of Pez (that's where we'd gotten the Pez from earlier, too.)  The bud he gave us was easily four times as big as the one we gave him.  Everyone there was so generous, so wonderful - the experience was the single most happy event of my life (and Chair's) - until we took the chips that had been dosed when we were back at home.
