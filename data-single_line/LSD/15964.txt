'We were tripping together, when I felt a surge of energy unlike any other. I had to excuse myself, because I had to lie down, everything was too much. So I go into my room, shut the door and the blinds, lie down, and get control of my respiration and heart rate. 'Relax, be the energy, let the river take you...' I was getting these huge rotating, overlapping and flapping arches type visuals, but the auditory vids were just as amazing, as the vids made 'bionic man' type sounds to them as the were going through infinity. As this is going, the experience is becoming more tense, I can feel every cell in my body flying off in a different direction. I'm getting stretched from everywhere so tightly, and the energy vids are showing what I'm feeling, that finally I feel free of my body, and the energy turns to Pure Light. Pure, unadulterated ecstasy. Casually the Light subsides... 'Now that I'm through, I wonder what's next, or is this acid out of gas?'
