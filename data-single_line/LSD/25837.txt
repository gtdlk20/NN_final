At about 2:00, 2:30 in the morning the show ended. We managed to get my friend who was having the bad trip outsite, although it took a lot of work. We hung outside the music hall with a big group of hippies until we found my other two friends. One of them had started having a bad trip and they had left before the show ended, but she had been talked down by my other friend.
