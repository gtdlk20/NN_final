Only those who are weak, fail to allow optimism to succeed in their lives. Why be so negative when life is so short? Where will it get you? Like I said, pessimism keeps you from being naive, but you can simply be aware of the dark side to keep you from harm. I say 10-20% pessimism, 80-90% optimism. This will aid you in thought of the highest levels.
