As soon as I opened up the door, and saw Louise sitting there with Frey still, I knew this wasnt over. It was too weird to be over. Too unusual. Too peculiar. My steps were fragmented, and tentative, and everything seemed suddenly extremely uninviting. The kitchen didnt look like a kitchen, the common room didnt look like the common room wed been hanging out in, and Diannas room was another dimension. The dimension where my sisters and I had to step and be together in, immediately, I thought. I needed someone that could relate to what I was experiencing as soon as possible.
