I was now feeling strong and centred as I stood there embracing the moment and this feeling. I heard this voice, He thinks he is powerful have a look at him. This was followed by sniggering and laughs. I look across the room and see these dark figures standing around a table in a dark corner looking over at me talking about me being intimidating. I now notice I am in a completely new room. I was standing at a bar by myself no one else was there except me and the entities in the corner. This room was like a VIP room or a nightclub owners room. For a couple of minutes, they messed with me being a little friendly then insult me. I was starting to feel intimidated and not sure what to do. Then I said to myself no I wont be intimidated, I wouldnt let that happen in my reality so I ignored them.
