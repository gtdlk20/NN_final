At this point I noticed with disbelief that the lump of gum I had left on the steering wheel was gone ; I was now *convinced* that while the cops had happily kept us stalled out on that dark road, they were busy searching our car for drugs. I was shocked and relieved that we had in fact had the dope with us out there and not left it in the car... it turned out , however, that this whole idea was just fantasy (the gum had dropped to the floor of the car) but this idea did contribute to the rush of thoughts and contemplation I had a short while later while we were sitting down outside the shopping centre again trying to get over this ordeal.
