Eventually the laughter subsided and I then (for some reason) grappled with the TV until it turned on.  At this point the trip reached an intensity previously unknown to me and I began truly *hallucinating*.  In my life this had never happened and hasn't since that day.  What I was watching on TV was in no way what would be viewed by a 'sober' person.  Giant Mardi-Gras style parade floats with dancing Japanese soldier's batons took the place of a typical scene and at this point the 'education' began.  During the next couple of hours I watched as the history of humanity, and, primarily, the oppression of women was displayed to me.  Alongside these fantastic, kaleidoscopic colored 'super-beings'(who seemed composed of light-energy or some such substance) were black-and-white scenes of horrible, disfigured masses of humanity racing along.  The split was remarkable between the two.  Intermittenly these female 'super-beings' with these outrageous tentacle-things coming out of their heads would appear and explain the course of humanity to me.  It was explained that evolution was the 'name of the game' and that we were moving toward becoming these fantastic beings ourselves.
