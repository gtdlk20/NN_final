Postscript: I never took acid again, it was a once and only experience for me, too harsh and in my case awakened too much 'truth you may say, I like this quote, it stands the test of time: LSD without a doubt, without a shadow of a doubt, whatever else you will say about it, will change completely a persons world view, forever; it will never be the same again, whether the experience was positive or negative- Dr. Ralph Metzler
