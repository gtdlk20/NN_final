We wandered through the aisles aimlessly, marveling at all the people.  The visuals began to kick in, and we were laughing and holding each other.  Many of the people stared, but they were not worried.  There were shops with huge shelves of multi-colored candles, and obviously those were interesting to look at.  We could smell the world, and all the strange herbs and foods.  As dusk slowly rolled in, we saw many fire circles being formed.  There would be a circle of hay bales and a fire in the middle.  A lot of smoking went on in these circles, as we soon learned.
