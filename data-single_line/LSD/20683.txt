My Bonnaroo trip was a perfect example of set and setting being so crucial for tripping. Having never had a bad trip (before or after Bonnaroo), I learned that too much overwhelming input in an unfamiliar place can be disastrous. Now, I consider that night a learning experience, but will take precautions to ensure it doesnÂ’t happen later on. I am so happy that I still intensely enjoy tripping acid, but now truly understand how powerful it can be.
