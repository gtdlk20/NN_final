The rest of the night and the next day is just a blur, but i know i ate 1mg alprazolam after smoking some more salvia, then three more before my film class the next day. It was the morning after that  day when I returned to baseline. I apologize for the end of this report being fairly weak, but i wrote the first part early after the trip and am just now finishing it to post.
