The second hour is where it got interesting. As we arrived to our home town, I decided that a discount store would be an interesting location to walk around and talk since it was the only thing open early in the morning. As I pulled off the highway, and arrived at the stop light, the world melted. The first time we had stopped in approx 2 hours was at a stop light in front of a food store, where we had realized that the dose we had administered had been much larger than previous times. I had never experienced heavy melting and visual distortion like this before. All my previous trips had been only a hit or two, the most being 5 hits where I experienced a very mental experience, rather than a visual one.
