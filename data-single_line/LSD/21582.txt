About 6 minutes after I placed the blotter paper under my tongue, I started to feel light headed. G told me to pass him the bag of weed I had brought. Placing my hand in my pocket to reach for it, I start to feel a little fearful. My heart was pounding. I felt it as if it were banging on my chest trying to get my attention as I try ignoring it to avoid panic. I start to feel something similar to a head rush, like Im going to pass out. I pulled the bag out of my pocket and gave it to G as J started to try to start a conversation with me. Im thinking to myself maybe hes feeling the same way. My trip soon changed when my visual experience changed dramatically.
