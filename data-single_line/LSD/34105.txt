Now some people might get concerned that three travelers in our state of mind would take to the road in an ice storm.  H and I seriously questioned whether this was even conceivable, but E assured us that he had it as long as I could back out of B's long, steep driveway.  My black car loomed before us like a dragon, huddled together against the cold.  It breathed and swaths of paisley camoflauge spun off its back.  We got in and began to leave.  E took over the controls once on the road and I in shotgun.  We pumped the drum and bass on my system and let the heat flow.  The experience of moving at high velocity was breath-taking in our heightened state.  Everything visual and tactile was so warped.  Suddenly, H grabbed my shoulder from the back seat and squeezed the hell out of my arm.  With great fear in her voice, she told me she was falling into nothingness.  I tried to calm her down and told her that we would take care of her, but she was really on her own.  Her energy spun me for a loop and I could no longer tell where we were.  I thought seriously how crazy it was getting in B's house, but didn't understand anymore that we were in my car.  E had his shit on lockdown though, cuz we were all of a sudden in my parking lot.  Scared H wanted my keys to get in the house, and I sat back to see if she could figure out how to get in.  She almost started crying but I ran up to show her how to use them.  She looked at me like I was some sort of magician.
