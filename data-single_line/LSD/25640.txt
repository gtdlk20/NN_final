That was one of the best trips ive ever had, and i really owe it all to a ceramic garden gnome. I know it sounds crazy, but he was a good friend and although i dont have him anymore, i do miss having him with me. 'BILL THE TRIP GNOME' I will always love that guy. I wish all of you acid lovers could meet him. I do think LSD is a great drug, and a wonderful way to find yourself. That nite i learned that you can love anything. Even if his reality only exists in my own head.
