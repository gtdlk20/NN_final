Before I knew, it was time to leave. I couldnt leave without saying goodbye to my friend, so I searched all over for her. Finally I found her and told her all of the strange things I had witnessed throughout the day. She still had that beautiful glow about her, and I couldnt take it anymore, she was too beautiful. I said goodbye and turned around to leave, when I felt her expression change and saw her glow change from a gorgeous red to a soft blue. I wasnt sure what that glow meant, much less the change in color of the glow, but I knew I had to change it back. I turned back around and looked her in eyes and kissed her on her lips like something you would see in a Cary Grant flick, very classy. As I walked out of Chuck E. Cheeses that day I felt a warm sense in the air, and everything around had a tiny hint of the bright shade of red that radiated from my loves lips.
