As soon as we got into the car we called some friends to find the hotel we would be staying with for the trip, and I was handed a nice sized square of the colorful blotter paper and quickly administered it my mouth. As we arrived at the hotel destination, our friends told us they would be going to bed, and we would be forced to make the hour and a half drive home now.
