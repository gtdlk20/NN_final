All this looped for eternity as we explored the apartment, revealing new rooms and activities. I was thinking that I wanted my girlfriend to be here with us, but she was not ready yet. I also realised that I love seeing people so happy and I was willing to break law and morals to see people happy. Their tears of joy shined upon my mortal body and cleansed my soul.
