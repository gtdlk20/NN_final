The music was playing and I was grooving around my living room and noticing that this was indeed some strong LSD. Mind manifesting indeed! I felt like I was walking around in my mind. I felt some kind of weird aura around my body, maybe just a heightened awareness of the somatic energies in my body. I don't know but I felt something.
