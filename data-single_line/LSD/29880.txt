By the time we get there it's around 11:30 and almost everyone there is trashed. People are dressed up in outrageous costumes and it's completey tripping us out. We automatically become the life of the party because everyone there is only drunk and we are tripping balls off of this amazing acid. Everyone starts talking to us and it's an amazing conversation. We decide to play some pool, but not really. We kinda just head over to the pool table and shoot a few and that got old fast. So I'm on one side of the table and Ally is on the other. When all of the sudden this guy C goes behind her without her knowing and acts like he's smacking her ass. This really pissed me off for some reason and I just start pointing at him yelling 'What the fuck is wrong with you!?' He comes up to me and gives me a high five and from then on all is well, or so I would think.
