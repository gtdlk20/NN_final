After that everything slowed down things started to construct again still spaces changing like new construction of reality passing by me. I associate it to trying to tune back into my reality of earth. I did find the lounge room again music off lights on and quiet, but could hold it this happened probably three times. Each time I struggled to accept I was back to my reality and it was real. It didnÂ’t feel or look right. I finally got back and stayed there, I questioned it was real again it no longer felt real it was just like all the other places I had gone past. But I felt the familiarity of it then I sat forward and realised I was back I found it yep I was back. I saw J which confirmed it and then the others.
