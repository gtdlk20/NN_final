This Acid was so different to me, It gave me a very strong body trip and mental trip, along with more visuals than the other acid I've done.  My body was feeling very weak yet so amazingly tingly. Like a shiver, but constant.  The sky became a flat purple color, and trees were flat black and cartoony. I am not used to this, but I was enjoying myself. We ended up having to leave ( drunk people need sleep) around 2am.  Driving was so scary yet completely amazing. I've ridden while tripping before, but this seemed different. We landed at an abandoned trailer on a backroad right behind a wild animal park.  The sounds of peacocks were so odd to hear while tripping.  Then my vision became completely altered, I was seeing things in like a purple writing, but shaped the way they really were supposed to be. Like comparable to the writing in the film 'MATRIX'. I was stunned, and this made me and LSD a closer companion. The night went on till about 7:30am, which started at about 11pm. The outcome was, we lost Derek along the way, and it was me and Jonathon at a gas station about 45 miles away from home. We had the ridiculous idea to follow a semi on the interstate to see where he was going.  After it war off, I had no come down, or even a burned out feel. I was amazed, and because of this I love LSD more than ever.
