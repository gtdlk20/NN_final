I had to escape Garrett. I wanted him to watch everyone else, to let me alone and be by myself.  He watched me as I shifted around, fluttering like a dying butterfly, sticking and stuck. I was nervous about these dratted nails I told him. I hated them. He seemed to smile at them. They made me fell he implemented fake? Yes, fake. And youre not fake, he said. I wasnt sure what he meant, honestly or sarcastically. I just marched away, saying at least I hope Im not fake. I wanted to clip them at first. I rummaged around, getting riled up over how much junk I owned. This is where I spend my mornings, every morning, here I am, using all these useless things. Why do I have so many useless things? Why do I need all these things? I finally found them. Aha! I walked over to the door where he was casually leaning and watching me. I didnt like his watching. Why was he watching me, what was he taking notes on? I surrendered to the idea that they were just more or less notes in relation to himself, because that is the way all people think, and so it mattered little to me again. I may need your help with theses. I could almost feel the relief, like breaking the nut of a shell. My cuticles were taking off their sweaters. I held them against my thumb nail and as I looked at the nail, the white tip was slipping down into the red. I wasnt going to cut them right like this. I wasnt going to let Garrett cut them off either. That was invading, Id have to let him touch my hands. Oh, and then I realized, I had come up with a solution earlier. I was going to find some gloves. I ran into my closet, I was asking Garrett something to get him away from observing me. I was asking something about himself, I wasnt actually listening to what he was saying, it didnt matter, I just pretended to sound interested. His relationship to me was inconsequential. These people were just there. They didnt matter. They had become like shadows and ghosts, phantoms in the wallpaper.
