'Dude, think of how smart the guy who owns this place must be' I reply 'He convinces people from all over the world to pay money just to enter this giant park, then makes you wait in lines to be put into a quick ride.  People from all over the world.  Wow I just realized how insignificant we are compared to all of this.  Even if people do know we're on acid it's not going to matter because they all have better stuff to do than tell on us.'  I began seeing the world through other people's eyes and realize that in their eyes I am a nobody.  Suddenly my body is hurled up then I'm thrown into a loop.  The roller coaster seems to be moving extremely slow and all the sudden I just got really happy.  I start laughing uncontrollably.  The roller coaster does a corkscrew and while we are upside down I feel like I could just fly away.  The ride stops suddenly and I am very disappointed, wanting the ride to keep going.
