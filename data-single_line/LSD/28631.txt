My trip only turned *mildly* bad when I was left alone with this guy.  We'll call him Fuckbag.  Fuckbag was on about a hit and a half, which I sold to him for an exorbant 15 bucks a hit (when I'd gotten it at 6.50) and he was bugging out--bad.  He was the kind of guy who filled empty space with needless conversation, and I thought he was speaking some weird, alien dialect of English that coincided only in its words rather than in sentence structure or grammar.  Finally, after listening to his raging trippy bullshit for a few hours, I came down, and had a very large, very tasty breakfast.  I know this story wasn't THAT amazing.  Peace
