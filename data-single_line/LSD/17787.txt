The next day, someone gave us an eighth of mushrooms.  The man camping next to us came over for a while to talk, and discovering that we'd purchased four hits of blue Felix paper acid, he offered to dose us from his vial.  We told him we were saving it for when we got home, so he put a total of twelve drops on some chips which we sealed up.  Then a man camped on a slope near our hill informed us that he'd been robbed, and since he was so upset, he wanted to smoke.  In return, he gave us a six-foot bong.  There were also some sugar cubes scattered on the ground from the bastard thieves' raid, and he told us that half of the cubes had been dosed and half had not.  He had been picking them up and eating them, and was quite fucked up.  He referred to the bong he gave us as a ten-foot bong, and had gotten scabs all over his face from who knows what.  He was barely coherent, but he enjoyed smoking, and it calmed him down.
