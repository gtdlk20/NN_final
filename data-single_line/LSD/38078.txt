As if reading my mind, Tom suggested we go buy something to drink from the store. 'Why not?' I thought. At this point the LSD wasn't doing very much and I figured that this was a good time to test myself in public. I asked Tom if he was tripping yet, because it had been over an hour now. He wasn't really. Right about then, Tom suggested we eat another tab. I had to agree with him. We decided tripping was worth doing, so it must be done right. We went back to my house (my parents had gotten home), ate the tab, and headed off to the store.
