Outside we met up with two LSD-experienced friends of mine, and we all sat down on benches and conversed for the next hour or so.  They shared their experiences and inquired about mine, as well as offering advice.  Both inside the restaurant and outside by the bench, I was seeing patterns on many surfaces.  Inside, the excess hot sauce on the plates seemed to form fractals, and outside the sidewalks swirled with the same dark mass I saw before.  By the time we left town, it was about 10:30 PM, and we decided to head back to my house.
