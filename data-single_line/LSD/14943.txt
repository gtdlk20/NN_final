My friend and I ingested two tabs of acid each while waiting for the bus. The bus came about 5 minutes later. About 10 minutes into our trip, everything started to seem strange and my teeth began feeling like they didnt belong in my mouth. 15 minutes into our trip, still on the bus, peoples faces maintained their shapes and colors but I was much less afraid to look at people and began to try to figure them out based solely on their actions, dress, and posture.
