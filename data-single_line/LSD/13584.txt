I have had an EXTREME phobia of centipedes my entire life. I am completely fine with other bugs. And even, if theres a wasp or spider in my room, I will catch it and let it outside. When a centipede crawls across the wall, however, my heart skips, I get very nauseous, and every muscle in my body tightens. Where I live, there are many bugs, and including centipedes, so its common to see one. The phobia has been very negative. If I were to see a centipede in my room, and it would get away before I killed it, I could not sleep in my room, out of fear. I would close my rooms vents in the summer time, since thats where many centipedes come from, but I would be pouring sweat because of it. If I see a centipede, my moral value that its not right to kill an insect, completely ceases to exist, due to the crippling fear they give me.
