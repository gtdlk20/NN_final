As we continued to talk this mask took on even more hidious looking features (classic gargoyle and ghoul archtypes)until it reach the point where it was nearly impossible to look at. M's face was at a profile to me but these other ghoulish faces continued to look at me from out of the side of his head. Then he turned to face me and his eyes and the eyes of these hideous gargoyles became one. I was staring directly into his eyes and then room exploded into green and all I could see were his eyes in a thick green fog. I remember thinking then that his eyes were the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.
