I arrive at the dealers house and take my 4 hits. The dealer and his girlfriend are already tripping and we listen to some Moody Blues. After about 30 mins, and 2-3 bowls of some fine herb later, I left the apartment and headed back to my friends' dorm rooms. Walking home everything began to morph. Lights were shining like the moon into my eyes, the street began to look like I was looking at it through a fish eye lens. Walking by people I was convinced I was acting really high and not normal. Anyway, after about a 20 minute walk back to my friend's place, which usually only takes about 5 mins, I sat on the couch. At this point I thought to myself 'This is quite possibly the craziest thing I've ever done.' I had just taken 4 hits which, from what the dealer told me, was equal to about 6-8 blotter hits, I was in my friend's shitty dorm room that was piled with garbage, and everyone else was nearly done with their acid highs by this time.
