Especially when my tripping friend said that the joke was stupid. My friend was basically just almost talking to himself its like my Russian friend didnt want us to speak at all not even softly. Maybe he wasnt used to us being so talkative? But we werent being that talkative. I mean we were kind of casually and humorously pointing out funny and strange things but being pretty covert and insider about it. I dont know what my Russian friends problem was but since that night hes admitted he was tripping out for no reason and you know his mom is always crazy because shes bipolar. Also it was late and they most likely werent used to people acting so awake and giddy at this hour. It was like the middle of the night.
