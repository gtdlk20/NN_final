Me: The last two months of my life have been loveless chaos, going through the motions of everyday life. I am experienced with enough psychedelics that I don't need to list them. I have taken LSD twice before, but never anything nearly as strong as these 'flies' would turn out to be. I had very high hopes for this night, and my mindset was excellent. I was ready for anything from a trippy buzz to rebirth. I would be eating 1.25 fly blotters.
