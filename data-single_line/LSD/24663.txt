Then a diesel truck comes over a hill about a quarter mile back. I dive into the 4 foot tall dripping wet weeds on the side of the road to hide from the bright lights heading our way. My friends fish me out of the weeds and throw me back in the backseat and take off again. Then they threw on Incubus - SCIENCE. By about track 9 I've settled down in the backseat. The end of that album is all acid jazz. We loved it of course. An hour and a half later we arrive at my house and crash after smoking a come down bowl.
