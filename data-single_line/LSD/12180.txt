D and I walked to a huge oval field, surrounded by a dense forest of eucalyptus on one side i noticed was breathing softly..there was an electric stillness in the area. I could not register the cold in my body though mentally i KNEW it was freezing!! D and I looked at each other in frozen silence, reading each other's minds. BANG!from this point on, we felt our experience becoming one and the same!
