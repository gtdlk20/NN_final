When we got to this Kidz appartment I realized quickly that this was a set up. They opened the door and told us to come in but the first thing I saw was a kid hiding in the hall and the barrel of a shotgun barely sticking out. I turned and looked at another kid who had a gun in his pants. As I started to bolt Tre also saw what was going on and started to run also. I took a few running steps and rather that go down the stairs I jumped from the second level walkway. Tre ran down half the stairs before looking back and seeing them start to come after us. I was already in the car and was starting to pull out while opening his door for him to jump in. As we started down the road 2 gunshots rang out and my mind went with them. I don`t know how we made it back to the hotel but we did and right then and there I lost it. I lost all track of everything in my mind. Nothing was real.I don`t really know how to expalin it without sounding like a fool but oh well. I lost myself as a physical being. I didn`t exist. No one did. Nothing was real. No shapes no thoughts,nothing. I was lost in a space of colors. Beautiful colors coming and going from every direction. Not a single thought existed. I was told that what it looked like is that I`d fallen into a Trance and about 20 minutes into it they said I just passed out. Out of fear of what had happened earlier no one wanted to call an ambulance and have everyone all freaked out so F.had some of the people there take off just in case anything happened to me so they wouldn`t be involved. I was that close to death becoming a reality and didn`t even know it.
