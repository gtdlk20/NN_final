Fighting through the chaos, I decided to play a video game. My unfortunate choice was 'Sega GT' on the XBOX. I played for a half-hour, and six wrecked Audis later, decided to give up anything involving coordination. I instead went outside into the mellow summer air for a smoke, and watched the fading sunlight disappear behind the grey-shaded mountains. This was definitely a high point in the trip, as the slightly rotating clouds and varying reddish and purple hues captivated me. Once the sun had set, I went back inside to be greeted by two cloaked figures toting glowsticks and LED hand lights.
