The cubes took about half an hour to completely dissolve. When they did, we drank up. (The acid, as I had expected, was tasteless in the Kool-Aid.) There is a sort of mystique to taking acid, because there is no turning back.  Plus, you never really know, unless you made the acid, how much you're taking.  You always know how much weed you're smoking or how much coke you're snorting, but acid can be deceiving.  A little piece of blotter can have a shit-load of acid on it. After about a half hour, my friend was obviously experiencing some effects:  a big smile, intermittently unstoppable laughter.  He also claimed to have vague 'trails.'
