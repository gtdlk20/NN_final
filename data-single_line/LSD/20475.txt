So ya this was a new and mind-blowing experience for me and him. The time looping thing that is. In the past on mushrooms I have had time slow down, speed up, stop completely and even cease to exist but this was the first time that time actually repeated..and started looping. Very off putting and confusing. I couldnt understand it. That seemed to be one of the themes of the LSD mindfuck is this melty cyclic out of order mindfuck where everything's just jumbled together and mixed around. It seemed like events happened out of order and its still hard to remember what order things happened in the trip as this mindfuck effect kind of carried out throughout the whole trip and infected the whole thing. It was like that movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas..just with the story being all over the place and out of order and fast and loud but visually appealing. Also colorful and pattered.
