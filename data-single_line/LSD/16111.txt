It was late after one of my favorite bands played in a small venue in Philadelphia, PA. It was about 1am when me and my best friend Matt were walking to my car as I heard the words being whispered 'doses doses' We approached the young lady, and she led us to her fearless leader Fabrenzio. We purchased 20 hits from Fabrenzio, and he quickly ripped us a strip of 20 off of his sheet.
