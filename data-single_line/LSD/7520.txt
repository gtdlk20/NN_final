I didn't know what I really expected out of taking acid.  Vaguely I had hopes that it may turn me into an extrovert or help me become sexually successful, but really I was just looking for a way to turn around what I perceived to be a very negative life trajectory that I was on.  I felt like I wasn't as happy as everyone else and I wanted to be happy like them.
