Not as euphoric and lighthearted or even as revelatory as mushrooms but equally as profound and spiritual. Reading all this it probably just sounds like some kind of crazy drug trip or spacey drugged out experience or maybe just a weird random night but thats just how it comes out in words and seems like if you havent been there. It was not what I expected, it was really kaleidoscopic, clean and mystical. The experience itself even though it was crazy and kind of cartoony and silly at certain points it mostly just opened so many doors for me in my life and Im still integrating what I experienced and learned that night and its already been almost 2 years. Theres many things that have never been the same since this trip. It was a very clean and clear mind opening experience and I mean that quite literally not at all metaphorically. It literally opened up the doors of perception for me.
