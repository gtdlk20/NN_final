One of my friends ran into two friends of his and we followed them to one of their apartments. When we walked down the apartment hallway, I hallucinated massively. As I walked down the hallway, black paisley patterns would be magically painted onto the walls in my wake. We arrived at the apartment and all sat down on the couch to roll up a fat joint or two. Every time I closed my eyes a brilliant shimmering curtain of rainbow colored flower petals would dance about.
