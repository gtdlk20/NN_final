Later that night, when we returned to the dorms, I was coming down but could still feel the effects somewhat. I felt a powerful need to communicate the revelation that I had, that every human being is valuable and deserves to be loved. The only real sin is harming another human, I said. I would say to strangers I met, I dont know you, but I love and respect you, and Im glad we exist in the same universe. I couldnt help but feel such profound love for every human I encountered that it almost moved me to tears.
