I put a hit on my tongue at about 7p.m. and tried to forget about it - I didn't want to worry, just wanted to see what would happen. After about 30 minutes I didn't feel any different, but N assured me it'd come on soon. Sure enough about 15 minutes after that he was like 'Don't things just look a little different to you?' and, looking over at a box of Trix cereal, it did look different and I didn't know in what way, but the rabbit was sort of moving and the lettering started becoming wavy and vivid.
