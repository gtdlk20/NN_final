The moral of this story is NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF LSD.  Once you do your fucked.  If i had been in public, I would have been arrested.  I totally lost contact with reality for about an hour.  Now, I am going to stay away from LSD.  To all you new, eager acid heads out there, beware.  What I thought was a joke of a dose turned into the most powerfull trip of my life.
