Dosed at midnight, by 1 oclock I was playing halo 2 on my xbox 360 when I got this sudden burst of energy and then I look around the basement and I see all these colors pertruding out of the ceiling tiles. Just to let you know this waas my first time and I was in my basement without any1 to watch me. So then I hurd my dad coming down the stairs so then I ran to my bedroom which was dark and hid uner the covers and closed my eyes. Then I get very sweaty and panicky and started hearing these loud sounds as if my dad came down and through evreything to the ground, and then I questioned reality thinking mayb I was throwing evreything to the ground and I just wasnt seeing it kind of like an out of body expierence, and this terrified the hell out of me so then I opened my eyes and looked around my basement and saw evreything was normal and that ended the peak of my trip
