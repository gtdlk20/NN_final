So I and three friends travelled from town to my place, and got comfortable in my small pad a few hundred metres from the house, the day was incredibly windy with scattered clouds. T offered us all a small amount of MDMA powder which we ate, this was around 12 o'clock. We didn't feel much affects from this but it certainly put us all in the right frame of mind for what was about to come. We chatted and riffled over music for a few hours and then at 2 o'clock I produced the goods. 4 tabs of lsd labelled with the cute and cheeky Mr. Felix the cat (a word goes out to whomever made this batch as it held a high reputation as being some of the trippiest acid our collective has ever tried) we all consumed with smiles on our faces.
