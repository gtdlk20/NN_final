After walking through the sand as far away from the park as we could get without getting wet, we light up the blunt and hope that a cop doesn't walk by.  People are everywhere and I kind of worry but I go for it anyways.  Maybe we can burry the blunt before anyone gets here and run for it.  Hitting the blunt makes me feel very different after the very first hit.  Everything seems so crazy all of the sudden.  I start telling my two friends how marijuana is such a big part of my life, even though they know that more than almost anyone.  I start to realize that ever since I took the acid I haven't felt the marijuana high very much at all, the acid was completely taking over the feelings of dumb happiness and making me think very rapidly.
