At some point, K looked at me and asked, How are you? I looked at him slowly and nodded my head. Words could not express how I was, so it seemed sufficient to give him the affirmative  yes, I exist. How I am is a non-issue, I just am. I also recall an odd moment of clarity in which I stressed to myself, This is only a drug. Even if its difficult, youll still come down eventually. In retrospect, Im almost proud of myself for having the strength of will to think such a thing in the midst of such a shit storm. After we had been sitting at Lookout Point for some time in various mental conditions, A, who was very familiar with LSD and more adept than the rest of us insisted that we continue hiking and make our way to the lake. P and K agreed, but I looked at T to find that he seemed to be struggling as much as I was, if not more. I tried to protest, but had difficulty speaking clearly. A insisted that moving would help me calm down and the group began moving.
