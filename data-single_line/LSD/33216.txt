	Still zoning to Floyd, I take a seat on the bench just beginning The Wall. My eyes are closed with my forehead resting on the edge of the table. The Thin Ice comes on the child crying gives me a little scare, and I pop open my eyes as result. Not 2 feet from my face underneath the bench, this hideous child with eyes wide as saucers is staring at me while simultaneously I hear it crying through my headphones. It was there as plain as day. My heart stopped. It was too real not to be.
