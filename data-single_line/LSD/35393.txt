Once I got there he said I heard some rumors about u and some kids trying acid...I said no and the nurse came up to look at pupils...that's when it really kicked in and her face looked like it was melting..they let the buses leave and they started checking my pockets and back pack bc my pupils where the size of the fuckin moon. I ended up getting detention bc j had a vape in my pocket. They grabbed my pockets and totally missed the acid so that was good but then all three of the assistant principles were in the room asking me what I took...I said nothing and they brought me to my asistwnt princluples office where they called my dad...the carpet was beutiful and and patterns and colors everywhere where amazing. He had me sit in a conference room until my parents came to pick me up. I sat there just amazed staring at this chair stretch and shrink, move closer and farther and there was this window with this huge tree that just looked amazing. The whole room was turning green and red and orange and there were flowers all offer the floor and I look at myself in a glass window and my hair was like floating up and glowing. Supriseingly I wasn't scared or anxious at alm throughout this and when my mom heard I was on acid she told them my eyes where big because I took an adderall that day so they would let me go home.
