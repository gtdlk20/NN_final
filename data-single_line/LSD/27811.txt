That is what I felt the last time, but didn't understand. I saw or felt, as I was turning my body, shoelaces (karmic threads) being vacuumed up and disappearing. A sense of recursive levels of a deeply nested function all finally collapsing and producing a result. These recursive levels went back for eons. I realized what karma is -- unconnected bits and pieces that need to be connected. The mind is on a continual quest for knowledge (spiritual growth), to make connections between ideas. That quest is necessarily repetitive, trial and error. A single experience of deep connection with the spirit might wrap up years and years of karma. Certainly the awakening of kundalini and the understanding of powers of the body hitherto unknown had this effect. Certainly the penetration of the light of consciousness, with its scientific training, into the depth of the unconscious, enabled the unconscious to make connections it couldn't make all by itself. And likewise, I the conscious mind made some connections that I couldn't make all by myself. These connections are visualizable as threads in the cosmic fabric... the ego and the id are relentless knitters, tying this fabric into a sensible reality. The mind is literally obsessed with reality and truth... obsessed with a need to know. So obsessed that it is willing to risk insanity or death to discover its true nature. Self-awareness is the process of connecting inner states to outer states, where those outer states are also a part of oneself.
