I sit and gaze at my surroundings.  The acid has completely kicked in and I am tripping out of my mind.  I love the beach and want to continue sitting here for the rest of my life.  I stare at the seagulls and I see a small patch of land a little past the tide.  I run towards the water and jump landing right on the patch of land and scaring hundreds of seagulls away.  I'm sad that I scared so many lives away and negatively impacted them, but happy that I am completely surrounded by water.  It's a very peaceful feeling.  Suddenly S informs us that we have been at the beach too long and I begin to panic.  Do people know we're on drugs?  Is anyone going to tell on us?  Am I going to go to prison and be stuck in Ohio?  Terrible things start affecting my brain and the only thing I can do is ask S what we can do to fix everything.  He says we have to go back to the part and starts walking away from the beach.
