When we left the neighborhood we went to Dennys where all our friends were. Only 4 of us went in, and thats where I really started to trip. I sat at the marble table as it seemed to smear and fold all over itself. The hairs on my arm started waving like I was under water. When I decided Im tripping to hard, I just walked out freaking out hardcore but maintained to keep my cool. When I attempted to drive back to the house with Mark, I stalled the truck out twice. Driving an automatic would have been the more logical thing to do.
