The next day we took the acid in my dorm room at about 3:00 in the afternoon.  Jessica only took 4 and sold her other hit to another friend who was going.  Jess and I had to wait for about 45 minutes for our ride to get there.  I was slowly beginning to feel not quite normal when Jess came to my room, saying she didn't want to be alone.  We both agreed we were a little fucked up.  We started to get kind of giggly and objects were beginning to be surrounded by rainbows of light coming in through the window.  Things were given rainbow trails when I moved my head.
