The day before the trip I get a phonecall from my friend Slim, he informs me that he found some acid (obviously knowing I would be interested). I was excited. I told him I wanted to drop early in the morning, so I could see the sunrise. Which was supposed to be the cool 'trip' thing to do, according to my friends.
