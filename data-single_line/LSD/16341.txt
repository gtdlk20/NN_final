I don't, and have never, bought into any mystical theories about drugs. I don't think that acid helped me to 'see God' or become enlightened, or anything like that. I do think that acid was a tool that helped me to get back a little bit of childlike wonder. It's enough, after a trip, for everyday things to be everyday things. And at the same time it's comforting to look at them and remember what they were like when they were NOT everyday things.
