Finally I pulled myself together, only because I knew my friend needed help, if I hadnt been there for him, I dont know if I would have ever got out of that trip. I managed to find him after we started coming down, but we were still REALLY fucking high, we walked outside and both said we had to get out of this house, both of us could feel a VERY evil presence in the center core  of that old home. My friend looked up at a tree and pointed to it noshalantly and said, hey, it's spinning.  I looked up and the tree turned into like dandyline branches spinning like there was no tommorow.  I found out that the acid I took made many other people go crazy, the guys that had the stuff destroyed a house they were at and flushed all there shit down the toilet.  I also found out that the 'one hit' I took turned out to be more like 15 hits.  Well I'm about tired of writing this now so I will try to sum it up.
