This night something altogether different would happen. I'd heard doses over 400 mics could cause some very otherworldly things to happen, I'd taken a pretty random sized square of high potency blotter I'd taken a pretty random sized square of high potency blotter acid that was likely more like 600mcg, whatever happened when you overdose on Acid, I was going to find out. I was prepared with a benzo and some opiates should it just get out of control,  but again, I had never had it happen and might not recognize it if it began. Tonight, it would happen. I would see that other side... I listened to David Bowie's Diamond Dogs at some point during the trip (the record has become essential for tripping ever after, I find it very comforting for some reason) and at some point saw Bowie himself staring down at my supine body (he hadn't died yet)--I didn't remember laying down, but I must have just found my way there in my reverie. This was the last normal thought I remember having, the next got really weird, the kind of stuff that scared Dr. Rick Strassman away from his DMT experiments; a spiritual encounter.
