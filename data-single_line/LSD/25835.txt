The setbreak seems to last forever (so did the first set) and it was almost agonizing the way it dragged on. I gave up looking for the chick because I was just tripping too hard. Finally, Hookah came back out. I realized not long thereafter, that one of my friends wasn't having that good a time. He was usually weary of crowds and I think it was just too much for him. Almost everyone else in the group was around dancing and having a good time, but I sat with him through most of it. He was really quiet most of the time, but would occasionally say something about him being dead and asking for answers. He had 5 or 6 sentences he more or less kept repeating. I knew it would be really difficult to get him out of there, so I just kept hoping that the set would last longer. By the time they got to the encore, all I could see of the band members were giant blurs when they played their instruments or otherwise moved. It felt like everything and everyone in the plus was wired in, even the band and the music.
