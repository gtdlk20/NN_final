Back in the late 90s I dropped a couple of hits of orange colored blotter. I hadn't dropped any acid in a few weeks and was tripping hard but was loving every minute of it.  We, myself and a friend, decided to go up to his older brother's apartment. When we got there, their was 4 other people we would party with on occassion sitting around drinking and smoking weed. Everyone in the apartment was a few years older than us. I didn't really trust any of them, including my buddies older brother.
