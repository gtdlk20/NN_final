And speaking of trips.. This is about the time when Sunny and I agreed we were coming down enough to go for a wintery ride in my trusty four wheel drive.  Everything remained at a higher intensity, yet the visuals had died down mostly.  But as we got out on the road, the car in front of us began to morph into a cat's face like the many other's I'd seen thus far.  It was a Honda CRX, and it seemed to have a happily menacing expression.  I'm reminded of the saying 'While the cat's away the mouse will play'.  And though I was in a potentially dangerous situation, I felt like I was in complete physical control, and felt at play.  Not being reckless, or even careless, I noticed I was nearly out of gas.  On top of that, I had no means of paying for gas on my person.  These facts caused a wave of fear and paranoia.  The thought of being pulled over terrified me, so we made a very short drive back home.  (I recommend not driving while on LSD, or any other intoxicant for that matter)
