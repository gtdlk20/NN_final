We return to the lake, and I am overcome with the same sense of peace and security as when I was first there. We relax and eat some food. I have some difficulty bringing myself to bite into an apple, it looks much more appealing whole. Eventually, though, I take a bite out of it, and Im amazed at how carnivorous I feel. Words like consume and devour play through my mind. I feel like I am killing the apple, like I am tearing it apart, but I dont feel any sympathy for it (which is good, because I am very hungry).
