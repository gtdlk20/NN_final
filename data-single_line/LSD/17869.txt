A good summary for this part of the trip, at the peak, is that it was somewhat like a lucid waking dream it was somewhat like a lucid waking dream. You are awake, but at the same time you feel as if you are dreaming. This awareness is counter-intuitive because even though you feel like you are dreaming, you arenÂ’t in control at the same time. Very similar to being in an actual dream and realizing you are dreaming but unable to wake up from it. Also just like in a dream your situation, your mood, your emotions can change on a dime. Things/visuals/sounds can be mentally indistinct, but at the same time vivid. Your entire world can constrict to your body, your mind, your partner, a video, your leggings as the patterns swirl, etc. There is nothing else. This is your world now.
