Background: My first 14 trips occurred within a timespan of 3 years between 2008 and 2011. I hadnÂ’t taken any acid in the 4 years since then, but I have been taking low doses of psilocybin pretty frequently in that time. In 2015 I averaged one psilocybin trip per month and I smoked weed more or less daily.
