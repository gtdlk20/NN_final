Tale:  A few mates and myself set off for a party in a neighbouring suburb. I didnt intend to take acid on the night as Id downed too many in local times, and I could feel the fry seeping into my frontal lobe, if you take my meaning. 9:00 pm fell from the sky, (wed arrived at the party half hour before, socialised etc ) and sure enough my mate suggests we perpetuate this night -with his impeccable insight into this language of ours- so we both took 4 tabs each. After an unknown hiatus of Absent-mindedly strolling around the perimeters I start to notice the preliminaries: speedy heart, rushing senses, physically uplifting electrics, confused visuals. Alls well at this point, Im contented roaching, drinking a fine ale and conducting anthropology. My mate catches up with me, informs me of; chronological presence, him being off his nut, the novelty of drunken behaviour. Herein I must of fallen deeply into intoxicated limbo, as I only recall events in an incoherent fashion with no indentifiable connective string.
