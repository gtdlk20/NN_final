This is when my trip started to get weird. I was laying on my sofa and just zoning out. Zonked, if you will. I still haven't sorted out everything I was thinking but it had something to do with how every machination of my consciousness was a lie somehow and that at every thought, and impulse of thought, I was leading myself astray from my 'normal reality'. I was being given 'messages' in my head that everything is infinite and every thing is connected to it's opposite and that everything WAS it's opposite because everything taken to it's extreme had the potential to become it's opposite, which, in hindsight, was some pretty basic yin-yang type stuff.
