We decided to go over to my friends apartment because it was his b-day and he was going to have a party. We made our way up there and when he opened the door and we walked in, all of a sudden everything changedtowards the worse. He was watching the new hairspray in a very dark room and I walked up to the tv and when I saw John Travolta in the fat suit, which was hilarious, for some reason I got really REALLY really frightened. Travoltas eyes seemed really dilated and the grew huge like alien eyes. I got cold/hot flashes and the room began to cave in on me. I had my ipod and decided to go in my buddys room and listen to some weezer because they always put me in a good mood. But as I lay on his bed and began to listen to the music, everything became tooo intense. I closed my eyes and I began to see all my friends and family, EVERYONE I knew laughing happily but aging at the same time and rotting out, I saw myself graduating college, getting married growing old dying..I saw the universe and my own insignificance within it. This all sounds very cool, but it was one of the most intense incites I had ever had. I couldnt keep my eyes closed it was too scary, but when I opened them, everything was still really messed up too. The lamp shades were dancing around the lamp, a movie poster was crawling around the wall and the ceiling was wavy as if it was liquid.
