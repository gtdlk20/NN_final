As I rounded the corner from my house, I noticed that the sun appeared to be setting in a most remarkable and amazing display of colors.  Glancing at my watch proved that this could not be- the sun had set almost an hour beforehand.  As I walked, I found it amazing that my own brain could hallucinate in such vivid color and realism.  The colors did not bleed over into the nearby objects, such as houses and trees, but instead stayed perfectly  within my view of the sky.
