As the music began to echo and reverberate through the room, I noticed that the patterns on the wall paper were starting to twirl slightly, this was about 1 hour after dropping. Within 2-3 mins I was seeing strange cartoon faces in the walls and textures appeared sharper, the trip had begun and I was loving it. In retrospect I got the most trip out this trip for some reason. The other 2 were still coming up. We decided to go for a walk around the house, it now being dusk and with poor lighting in the other rooms, they took on the twilight of the night. There was this fantastic energy flowing through my veins; I loved every blissful second.
