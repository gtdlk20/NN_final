Around 10:00 P.M. I get everyone out of my car except for Ally and  two other of my friends (Zee and B). We headed over to my other friend Ari's house to see whats up and to see if he wants to hang out for a while. He is deathly afraid of LSD so he opted not to take a ride with us. We go over to Zee's house and on the way there the effects are kicking in farely well. It's around 10:15 and I'm getting very good tracers and I'm feeling very euphoric.
