The Comedown and After Thoughts: After an hour or so, the 4mg of klonopin really killed the psychedelic headspace and I asked my friend if he could do me the favor of driving me home. At that point I just wanted to be with my family and call it a day. By this point also I was back in tune with everything and was glad and humbled that I wasnt a god. Because that would be a hard and lonely job. I was glad that I wasnt just in a world that was a figment of my imagination because I learned that would also be lonely as fuck, and I think thats why during the trip I was grabbing at my friends hoping that their reactions were real and genuine.
