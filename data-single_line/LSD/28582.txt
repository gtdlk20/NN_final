While walking everything had a fluroecent hue to it. But taxis stood out like dogs balls. By this I mean they were lit up in some ' thats the way to get home ' sort of way. I stopped and sat on a curb in a street just off the main road. My brain was racing all I wanted was this drug to stop and me to be at my nice safe home, then some guy pulls up and asks me whats wrong (Very weird now I look back). I say I just need to get home, he asks again whats wrong. At this point I just am not thinking properly at all and grab the back door handle and try to get in the car but as I grab the door handle he speeds off. Gloom doom and despair. I felt trapped. As if the whole world was trying to stop me getting home. I kept walking up the main road. I went to a house and knocked on the front door and asked if I could use the phone. An old granny who I probably scared the absolute shit out of said to go away. I kept walking to a service station and finally called a cab.
