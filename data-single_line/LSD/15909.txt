That last trip all happened yesterday. The thing I love about acid is it makes me think about what I'm doing with myself. I started thinking about myself a lot at Denny's and decided I'm done with acid. I don't think I could ever take a trip again because my last one was too scary. I would never want those repetitive thoughts coming back to my head. It made me feel like a schizophrenic crazy man. I saw people in my ceiling when I got home and started talking to them. This is a side of me I never want to see again. The lesson I learned from this is that people can't do acid a lot. It really does fuck with my brain and drive me crazy.
