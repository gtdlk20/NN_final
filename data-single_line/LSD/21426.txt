This term is troubling to me. It is a linguistic paradox, which in my case induced a terrifying, seemingly endless thought loop upon asking myself the question; Who is it that seeks to destroy the ego? I came to the idea that the ego is something created when we attach a thought, sense, or a memory of an experience to oneself (self meaning a conscious physiological organism). So to say that I had this incredible moment of absolute bliss during which there was no ego present, seemed almost insulting--because if there is no ego, then who just had this experience?
