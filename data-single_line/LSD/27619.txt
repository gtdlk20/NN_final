We headed for the BMW pavilion where they have luxury cars hanging from the ceiling - this was intensly amusing - and clean , smooth decor ,polished floors etc which was very pleasing to look at. But of course we wanted some more adventure, so we headed back towards the shopping centre... when we came to cross a road I remarked to Dave that I could feel the sounds of the passing cars deep within me, but all he could do was burst out laughing in reply.
