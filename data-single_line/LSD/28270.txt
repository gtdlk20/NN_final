So we drove yet again and while driving we see this beautiful river that was fed from a glacier and it was beautiful. We parked the car and climbed up the hill and all of the sudden we stopped and looked at the ground and there was a fast layout of vibrant colours these moss like plants grew all along this forested hill and they all had different colours from red to blue from green to orange and we were absolutely blown away after a huge colaberation of this we decided to move on
