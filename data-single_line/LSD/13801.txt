I started to relax as earth mother Sue talked me down in soothing tones, and suddenly everything was fine, ecstatic in fact. When we got back to the house, loud music was playing it could have been the Moody Blues Knights in White Satin or perhaps Jethro Tull singing Mother Goose from the album Aqualung; whatever it was, it was riveting, penetrating my nervous system with joyous powerful surges, strawberry incense was burning and as I smelt it, it was liquid love, taking me into deeper ecstasy until I couldn't see anything except brilliant white light and the world would come and go in it.
