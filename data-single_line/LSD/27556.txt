Its a haze now but I remember laughing constantly and uncontrollably for a long while. After a point I wanted to phone home and tell my parents that I would be staying out tonight because like a fool I hadnt thought ahead and made excuses. Being apocalyptically tripping I didnt want to use the phone in the house as I thought that people would play pranks on the other extension and there was no way was my mind flexible enough to cope with such high jinks. The idea came to me to walk to the nearest phone box, which was at the end of the street outside a string of shops. I asked for volunteers for my journey but none were forthcoming. After a period of trying to string enough sentences together to convince someone to go I decided to make the walk alone.
