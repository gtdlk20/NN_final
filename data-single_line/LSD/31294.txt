Obviously, its not like I had tremendous amounts of control over what I perceived, and Amaya did have a night-light, or some derivative that reflected light, and the room wasnt pitch black. I was able to see her Suits large poster hanging off the wall: it showed two shadows of tall men wearing suits, both black, blurred out silhouettes, against a purely white background. I saw them melting and morphing in front of me. I felt like I was watching an optical illusion, as they blended and harmonized with such a contrasting, solid, backdrop.
