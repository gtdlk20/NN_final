The next thing I remember it's third period at school the next morning (9:15am or so). I'm sitting in art class at my small Christian school trying to draw a still life. I look at the drawing in my book and the stick figure I drew is magically come to life and is dancing around on the page. I slammed my book shut and stared at the still life on the table in the center of the room. A small desk lamp has come to life, and alternately 'stares' at me or jumps around smashing other items on the still life. I rub my eyes and everything is in its normal place but is slowly changing colours! This time I smack myself thinking it will get my head in line and a miniature stuffed version of the school's mascot (an eagle) is laying on the table talking to me.
