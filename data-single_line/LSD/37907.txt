There was a lot of teeth clenching and a fair amount of paranoia (on my part), but the latter is normal for me with more than one hit. Teeth clenching seemed most treatable using 'Mixed Fruit MENTOS' -- but they taste awful. 'You think you want one, and you put the Mentos in your mouth, but by then, the Mentos has used you for its' purposes.' But they crunch well. I had massive synesthesia on one, with sounds happening, instead of tasting the Mentos 'goodness'. (yecch)
