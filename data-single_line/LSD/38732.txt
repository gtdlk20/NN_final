Then i thought that I was in the making of the next Star Wars... Episode II.  Frank Oz the voice of Yoda had died, and i was the only one who could talk like Yoda. I was running around talking like Yoda.  I thought my friends Laurie and Melissa were there.  I remember talking to a girl who i thought was Laurie.  That's when the corporations too over.
