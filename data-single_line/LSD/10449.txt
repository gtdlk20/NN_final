Let's start out with your basic introduction.  I am your average late-teen, early-twenty year old psychonaut.  I've injested countless quantities of short acting tryptamines, phenethylamines, cactii, mushrooms, and I quit counting after my 55th acid trip.  Don't get me wrong though, I'm not an escapist.  I don't want to leave what I have.  I love every aspect of my life.  I have a wonderful girlfriend, maintain a Dean's List standing at a University, and have a job that pays well.  My parents have always cared for me, and although haven't always approved of what I've done, they've never left my side.  So maybe you'll call that typical, boring, or ordinary.  Well it's extra-ordinary!  I adore what I have and what I felt I almost gave up.
