If that sounds like a pleasant experience, well, it was. I didn't really mean to ingest that much, and it was pretty freaky at first. I can't stress enough the importance of having a friend with you when you trip, preferably a friend who's done it plenty of times before at much higher doses, so that when u think the world and your mind are going to shatter into a million prismatic pieces, someone's there to convince you otherwise.
