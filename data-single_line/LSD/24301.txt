They told me something about them rolling down a hill but I couldn't understand, I wish just so happy to see them. I'm not exactly sure what time it was then so I'll have to guess around 8:00. We were all ready for a short break so we drove to a grocery store to get something to eat. (It made sense at the time okay.) Jim was the only one with any money at all so we walked around telling Jim what was good to buy. It was so bright and weird inside, we finally decided to get caramel apples to eat and we got in line to purchase them.
