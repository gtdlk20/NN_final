Both me and my roommate sat in the living room waiting for the come-up. Maybe 20 minutes after taking the tab, M looks at me and says I've never tripped so hard in my life!. At first I thought he was joking. He hadn't even taken a full tab, and I assumed it probably lost a lot of potency with the reagent kit. He then goes into his room, and I turn on the song Echoes by Pink Floyd. At some point during the song, I started getting extremely intense visuals. The wrinkles in my jeans suddenly turned into a wavy ocean. I was both amazed by how a substance could do something like that, but also fucking terrified. I only had gotten tracers and some mild movement on my 2 previous acid trips. The music was able to keep me calm for a while, as it is my favorite song of all time. If you've ever heard echoes, you'd know that it gets extremely dark right in the middle for about 4 minutes. This is when things started to get really crazy. The whole room went dark and began changing shapes; the walls were warping and I started trying to hold on to anything that I could use as a reference to real life.
