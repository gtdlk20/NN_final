I have to confess, I was in literal awe.  I had never up until this point been so blown away by the purity of a feeling.  The joy my religious upbringing had promised and failed to supply was being poured out by the barrelfull.  And the feeling of expectation was almost unbareable, however our attitudes didn't match this.  We didn't care if nothing else happened because the euphoria was far beyond what we'd been experienced with.
