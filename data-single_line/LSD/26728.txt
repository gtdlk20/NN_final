My leg only spasmed for about 5 seconds, but as i regained control of my body, i was still completely and utterly confused about my surroundings. Not only did i not know where i was, i couldn't even recognize what my surroundings were. The hill, the grass, the trees, the lights coming from surrounding houses, the road, the sky - it was like i was a newborn baby looking at the world for the first time. The only possible way for me to further describe the alien setting i was in, was that there were what appeared to be 'tiki gods' large and small everywhere, mumbling incoherently. The only thing i can remember thinking during this was, 'i've never experienced anything like this before, i have no control over my body at all.' What i saw was the most intense hallucination i've ever experienced, and i've eaten an abnormally large amount of acid over the years, and more potent lsd, too. The effects, after i fell to the ground, only lasted about 20 seconds. As soon as i was able to pick myself off the ground, i got up and maneuvered through the maze of trees, which i still didn't fully recognize, and almost zombified, i stumbled home. I went inside and began to attempt to sort out what just happened and what had caused it. I didn't remember tensing my muscles and holding my breath for about 20 seconds.
