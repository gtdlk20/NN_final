I finally made it to the parking lot after an eternity of walking.  I had lost Hayden, but i knew i'd see him again. I went over to the rental car i had come up in, and layed on the back window.  I looked up at the stars, and i saw the milky way smeared across the darkness. I fell asleep glad to be out of the whole mess.  Someone nearby was playing some Grateful Dead on a car stereo, and i fell asleep to Jerry's guitar.
