Ryan tells me I scared him earlier, that he was worried I wasnt going to come back to him. We talk  about wild feminine energy and about yin and yang. Throughout the night, he keeps talking about darkness and the devil and good and evil, but I have trouble feeling the same urgency and doom when thinking of evil. I know there is light and good and love and there is also dark and hate and anger, but I dont know if theyre adversaries. I dont even know if you must avoid one and only seek out the other. How can there be a sun without a shadow? They are both necessary to life.
