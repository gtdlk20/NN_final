My girlfriend and I have been exlusive, and in a serious relationship, for a good long while now.  At the time (about two months ago, in May 2004) we'd been dating seriously for about 11 months, almost a year.  I love her more than I love life itself.  I'm most definitely what they call 'the romantic type', and she is pretty moderate in that department compared to me, but definitely has some 'romatic' qualities to her.
