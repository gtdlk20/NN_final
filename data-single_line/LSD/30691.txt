Once we were there, and we stayed there from 12:00 to 6:30 AM, it felt like time had completely halted. It didnt fast forward or rewind uncontrollably, it just... Stopped. We wondered if the sun was ever going to come back up. When it finally did after what felt like days, we stopped tripping almost immediately. The come down was so smooth that by 8:00 AM we happily drove to McDonalds with no signs of intoxication other than a beautiful afterglow.
