It was on. Theresa and I went on back home and slept for a few hours woke up showered and chilled for a while. We made it back to Austin around 6:30(fashionably late)and no sooner made it in the door as my friend Tre said 'open up Kid'. He dosed me about 10 drops of the Sickest Liquid I`ve ever come across. We chilled there for a while and by 7 were out the door to another friends house. The Trip started to set in a little within an hour but it was a feeling I had never experienced before. I felt really uptight and on edge so I smoked some hydro and tried to relax. No dice. This feeling went on for almost 4 hours and I was feeling pretty sick pretty much just thinkin it was bad acid but not wanting to say anything to Tre to Dis his shit. Tre decided it was time to set his plan in motion and asked us if we were ready to go. I asked him where to and he just smiled. O.K. no biggie,this is Tre...so off we went. Me, Theresa, Tre and his Girl. Our destination turned out to be a Howard Johnson Motel in Austin on the top floor of all places.
