At some point, towards the last maybe ⅓ of the trip we ended up watching Dean Deacon's "When I Was Done Dying". And I just started crying with tears running down my face during it, it summed up so much of what we had experienced, experiences that Ive really only touched the surface of in this trip report. Sooo much more happened that I havent even mentioned. Tripping is an experience that lasts for hours and hours, and hours. For us, easily 8-12 hours of real time, and in the trip those 8-12 hours can feel like a lifetime, multiple lifetimes, an endless sequence of eternities. I could fill up another 6 pages with our experiences, but its so hard to put into words adequately, especially now two days later, what we went through that night and early morning. But in this video they do it beautifully. Soooo many scenes in the video hit REALLY REALLY hard and are sooo fitting.
