I get to D's house to pick up C and S.  S hands me a large bag of marijuana and gives me the box of blunts I forgot to take home the last night.  I understand without being told and split a blunt, empty the tobacco and refill it with marijuana. We then stop at the gas station to stock up on food (Doritos) and Drink (Dr. Pepper).  C steals S's spot in the front seat.
