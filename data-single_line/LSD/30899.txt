Speaking of, everything was too much. This particular state caused me a lot of what is commonly known as distress. Im saying commonly known because the word closest to describing how reality affected me at that point was distress - yet it holds a really negative connotation. I want to highlight the fact that the distress I was feeling wasnt entirely negative, oh no. This goes for anything else that might follow in the report: even if it seems like Im describing negative emotions, they most definitely werent. Most of my trip was tainted by euphoria, wonder, and confusion - but overall, it was a very neutral experience, which made it much more complex, and interesting.
