Kid A and I lay in our separate beds, scarcely breathing. Both of our hearts racing, Kid A countlessly uttered, 'I'm tripping so hard, oh my god, this is really scary'. I too was feeling the intense effects surrounding me. My mind was awash in visuals. I was struggling to discern what was real around me, and was extremely grateful for having Kid A there. He helped ground me, and allowed me comfort in that I wouldn't be lost in this psychic journey.
