I was looking forward to this day for weeks due to the fact that the first trip I had was such an uplifting and positive experience. I'd heard that setting was important, and a relaxing environment was necessary but the first time we had gone to see the fireworks in vast crowds and I didn't mind. About 10 of us went to the zoo but only 4 had the blotter (myself, C and 2 friends of C I'd never met that hadn't had it before, lets call them S and R). It is good to have a couple of co-pilots around if things turn sour. I'd eaten only a small meal for breakfast and drove round to a friends to meet up with the other people.
