I've tried taking acid twice before. Once it just didn't happen, and the second time I did it by myself and I had a very bad experience, and I'm not sure if it was bad acid or something else entirely. My mind kind of crashed in on itself and I felt like I was trapped on a roller coaster ride of my life. I cried nearly the entire time, and I don't remember how long it lasted. It had very minor visuals and I recovered in the end by smoking some marijuana. I've also tried MDMA three times before and smoke marijuana regularly.
