The biggest danger is the panic reaction. Don't Panic! The unconscious is still operating, so just letting go of the ego is the answer here. I had the idea (the same fallacious idea I had the first time) that the only way to recover normal reality was to retrace my steps... this is wrong. Normal reality is a natural state of affairs... simply allowing normal reality to return, having 'faith' that everything is O.K., and not worrying about it, is necessary here. Going toward the light does work. Light is input from out there, and restores ones orientation to the world outside.
