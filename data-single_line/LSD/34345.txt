I've recently read about Trey's experience on mixing LSD with mescaline, something about his recollection struck me as to how similar it was to mine, only I had just taken LSD alone.  One afternoon myself and a close friend did some acid, and experienced the usual tale of warped images, however approx 6 hours later when I thought that the effects were begining to dissipate, I was astounded to see something which was amazing and uncontrollable - and ultimately emotionally stunning. No matter how much I tried to change my focus on to something else, the things I were seeing remained.  These things or thing, was in fact a jelly like sheen which coated my whole body, which I could only detect by sight (at first).  It looked like what I imagine a drop of milk would look like suspended in geletine, sort of forming a minute yet complex white misty cloud, it hovered about an inch above my skin (not my clothes)  As I began to explore this occurence more closely - by looking at my fingers, I saw fleeting electrical sparks, the smallest I have ever seen, these electrical sparks seemed to be thinner than the finest hair and lasting only a fraction of a fraction of a second.
