125 min later: as I reach to turn off my lamp my fingers start to melt and drops of flesh spash on the carpet. I get scared and sit back on my bed realizing that my toes are metaphorically catching fire and as well start to melt off my foot.  By this time the hair on my legs are totally gone and my bed catches on fire!  I lay down again and this time have my legs off my bed extended straight out to watch my toes.  Then notice my knee cap bubles up and catches on fire.  About 4 to 5 min after watching this my leg melts off my thigh it drops but I don't hear it hit the ground.  I don't remember much after this but I remember I tripped for about 6 or 7 hours.
