About 40 minutes later we decided to walk to the graveyard, but halfway there we decided to change our minds. As we walked back, i saw two cats and i pursued them. As i walked toward them, i heard a strange noise from the gutter. ( i later found out it was a frog croaking.) it scared the crap out of me and i ran off giggling insanely. i was convinced there was a monster in the gutter. the other girl that was with us began croaking and i began laughing in hysterics. By this time i knew it was kicking in.  They went back to get some ecstacy from someone while i wandered around. everything was strange and new. someone approached me wanting to buy a roll. but the strangest thing happened. i couldnt get it out of my wallet. everytime i opened my wallet, it was a confusion of colors and madness. i threw the wallet down on the ground. i couldnt understand why i couldnt get it out. luckily, my friend found the roll and my wallet. then we went n a car ride.
