My friends started laughing at me when I got back, I told them  it was way to fucked up in there. The guy driving went into get me food. While in there buying me food my brain lost all rational functioning thought. I started saying things like ' What are we here for ' ' What can I do '. Basically I could not think of my purpose. It felt very dumb now that I look back. I'd say' thats what I can do put on music ' But as soon as I did that I had to find another purpose. I had become uncomfortably restless. The guy came back and we started eating hamburgers. It did not taste good. Actually very yuckky. We left for my friends house. I dont remember the drive there.
