Eventually it did kick in and the first thing I remember doing is rolling around in my bed, laughing to myself. Then my sister came into my room, apparently I disturbed her by rolling around too much in my bed or something. To my surprise I was able to talk to her normally and I told her I was sorry and IÂ’d try to keep to keep it down. The reason why I was rolling around so much is because I loved he way the acid made my body feel, silky and elevated, and my head felt just wierd, but I enjoyed every second of it
