T 2:30-3:30 - There is a hill beside my house that is pretty steep that has since been developed on, but ever winter my brother and I make a ramp at the top of it and jumps at the bottom.  The ramp is solely used to collect speed.  I grab my snowboard and go out and mess around for a little while, though I am physically inept at this point and can't land a thing.  I walk back inside and make a few cocktails and watch a movie, the Doors.
