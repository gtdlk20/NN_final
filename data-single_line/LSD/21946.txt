Once I returned we sat down near a sign post and S pulled out a sandwich to eat. We were all just chilling when I got a strange feeling in my stomach. Almost like a vague sense of dread and it was at that moment that I realized that I was in way too deep and that I should have just waited instead of taking the second tab. it was at that moment that I realized that I was in way too deep and that I should have just waited instead of taking the second tab. I try to play it off as my nerves just getting to me and after S finishes his sandwich we are off again.
