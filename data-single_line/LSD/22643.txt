Anyway the trip is not the reason I'm writing, but the never-ending after-affects. Its been over two thirds of a year and they are still very intense. From derealization to intense after-imaging and hallucinations. But the only issue this drug has brought me is intense anxiety. I have never been an anxious person until now. I think the anxiety is related to my mind processing too many details in the environment around me like noise and movement. I can't even look at a carpet for too long with out it moving or sparkling. If I focus on a complex design in one specific spot the whole room in my peripherals will go dark and I will be tripping. I can control some of the visuals but the anxiety and weird wonders about reality are always constant. Driving in the night is trippy. Signs multiply and all lights and reflections have intense halos that is very distracting because that are neat to look at sometimes.
