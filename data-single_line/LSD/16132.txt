Matt and I had been talking quietly about acid at the diner as to not make it public that we were completely out of our heads. We both agreed that the two young female employees seemed very strange and they disturbed us both. When Matt suggested very loudly that we give them some acid to help this situation, I decided it was time to move on. As we attempted to leave, the display continued when Matt tried to pay our bill with his new Digital Camera. When the waitress refused this seemingly great offer, he quickly produced some money which the horse-faced monster accepted and let us go. The walk to the car is when I realized that something had gone astray with my best friend. He removed the camera from his pocket and clenched it in his little skinny fingers, or wait, are they fat and chubby?? Anyways, he raised the camera high in the air, and quickly thrust it towards the ground where it skid many feet. He added to the display by trowing his cigarettes and lighter away into the parking lot. I quickly ran to the camera and shouted 'What did you do, that was your camera.' He just looked at me and shrugged his shoulders with his hands out with a large smirk. His scruffy face annoyed me, and I knew that something was not right now.
