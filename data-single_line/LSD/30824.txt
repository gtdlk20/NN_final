As soon as we saw our trip location, I was positively satisfied. It was a dorm apartment, so it wasnt enormous, but definitely bigger than Summers. There was a small hall and a living room area with a round circular table and a couch, as well as a decent bathroom and average-size kitchen. Dianna also said we were welcome to go to her room whenever, since her roommate wasnt home, but we remained in the common area for the initial part of the night. One of the reasons why we had also decided to do it at Diannas was because she had prepared endless tubes of acrylic pigments and large poster-size paper for us to paint on.
