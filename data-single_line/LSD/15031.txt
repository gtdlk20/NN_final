I'll be the first to admit that I have my share of vices. I've been known to occasionally drink and smoke to excess, and I am guilty of occasional lust, but tonight I've taken the first steps toward tempering those. I decided that, as I've recently been smoking far less marijuana than I had in several years, due primarily to lack of money and a quality supply, and had been grateful for the clear-headedness that relative sobriety provides, it seemed pointless to be drinking as much alcohol as I had been over the last year, and that if I wasn't driven to smoke something that has positive effects, then I should make an effort to smoke fewer cigarettes, which only provide a fleeting satisfaction, as well.
