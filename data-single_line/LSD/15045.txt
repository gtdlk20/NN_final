It is now 6:30 pm, and even though I've come down to pretty much baseline, it's been 18 and a half hours since I took the first two hits and, while I felt particularly tired about 7 hours ago, having spent quite a bit of time lying on the couch seems to have been plenty restful, as I could easily stay up til much later this evening with no trouble. My body, however is quite fatigued and so I'm going to go lay down and see if I can't catch some shut eye.
