When the movie ended, I decided to go into the guitar room and jam with all my friends. The effect of the acid was really starting to mess with me. I played the guitar while the strings moved around me and danced while I was playing them. More people started to show up to my friends boyfriends apartment. I needed air. My friend and I walked outside and decided we wanted to get a Widespread Panic cd out of her boyfriends truck. After sitting outside in the cold laughing because we didnt know how to get in the truck, her boyfriend came out with the keys and unlocked it for us. We sat in his truck for about 30 minutes wondering how to get the cd player open. Everything seemed to take so long to do. I couldnt figure out why normal things I would attempt to do seemingly took an extra 30 minutes. It was hilarious. I loved this new way of life. I felt like I was literally in slow motion.
