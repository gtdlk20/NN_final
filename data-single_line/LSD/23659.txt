I suppose that before I go on, I should detail my experiences with mushrooms. I have always had a very high tolerance for mush. It got to the point where I would average 5 grams per dosage. One time me and my friends bought alot of mush and after I was done dividing it up I was left with a huge amount for just myself. I think it looked like about 9 grams. I ate it all and was pretty messed but wanted more (as always). When high on mush, everything agrees with me (EXCEPT people asking me if I am high, how high I am, etc.). Everything is more intense. Music is enjoyable, cigarettes are like candy and video games are like disneyland.
