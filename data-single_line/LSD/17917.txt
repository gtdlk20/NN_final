This describes one of my last experiences with LSD. Before this experience I had taken LSD maybe 20 times and mushrooms less than 10 times. I also had prior experiences with marijuana, inhalents, alcohol, and nicotine but I was not a regular user of any of these. It had been about 5 years since my previous experience with hallucinogens. The intervals between LSD experiences had grown longer with time The intervals between LSD experiences had grown longer with time, and the doses had grown larger too, in an effort to somehow test myself and touch back on something very wonderful that I'd once experienced on LSD. I was not taking any prescription medication; although, I probably would have been a good candidate for Prozac at that time and was what you might call depressed.
