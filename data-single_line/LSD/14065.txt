T=2:30: I finally started to see some weak visual trails.  Still no 'breathing walls' or anything I had been told to expect by friends or read about online.  Colors were still vibrant and beautiful though.  Grabbed a sodium acetate hot pack to look at because I figured the crystals that form in them would look interesting with these visual effects.  Took a 5th tab.  Got into bed since I wasn't sure if I would feel drunk/unsteady when the stuff finally kicked in.
