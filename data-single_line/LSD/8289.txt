I think about that night every day. I run through everything I can remember in my head, and try to work it out, but I dont really get anywhere. There are about 4-5 hours in total of my trip that I have no recollection of at all. There was a lot of other stuff I saw that night that I cant remember now. I think thats probably a good thing.
