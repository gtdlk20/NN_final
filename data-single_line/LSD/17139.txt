After an hour, I was hallucinating lightly and my brain was beginning to process thoughts that I now cannot remember or fathom.  At 7:30ish (thanks to my watch) I put on my combat boots, and started walking through my neighborhood.  This in and of itself was a strange reaction to the acid- usually LSD makes me very introspective and reclusive.  I began to hear a 4 bar melody playing in my head, one I had never heard before.  The music stayed in my head, looping infinitely throughout the rest of the trip.
