I realized that in less than in one hour after ingestion I was seeing more visuals and movement than in peaks of past trips.  I could see for miles across the tops of other hills.  The pine trees liquefied on the distant hills.  The scheme swirled and bounced into a massive blanket of green.  Clouds peeled and bounced to the same rhythm as the flow of green before me.  The air thickened into an almost gel-like substance.  It felt hard to breathe and walk through the thickness.  My skin was wet and sticky.  I reached down to pick up a piece of quartz rock. I realized my robotic movements and how simplified my thought process had become.  I stood up and saw everything was moving in one rhythm trapped inside congruent fractal geometric patterns.  I threw the rock and its white tracer lingered long after the rock had landed.  My friends and I decided to throw some rocks off the cliff ledge for a while.  The tracers were splendid in length and brightness.  Once again I looked at my watch and decided that I was tripping my hardest ever, only minutes after the first hour.  I then became frightened and began to ponder, 'how long and intense is my trip going to be?'
