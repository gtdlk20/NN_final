After jamming on the piano for about 30 minutes, I noticed that something was amiss. Upon further inspection, I realized that there were no batteries in the keyboard! And then it hit me! I came to the realization that the LSD had unlocked a part of my mind that had powers to know the exact pitch of every key of the piano! As I pressed the keys, my mind would recreate the correct tone at a volume that was so loud it seemed to be coming from the Casio! I had been fooled for half an hour by this neat illusion. My friend Drew asked me what the hell I was doing. I shared the revelation with him and thought he would be excited too, but he just thought I was being loony, and continued playing his video games.
