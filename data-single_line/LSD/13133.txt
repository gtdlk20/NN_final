I turned and picked up my phone. It stretched and contorted in my hand. I struggled to read it, or even hold it. The lock screen displayed a notification. AJ replayed your snap. Suddenly struggling to swim back into reality, my mind raced for a memory. What had I sent? I dont remember talking to him. I opened the app, the snap was replayed 19 minutes ago. What have I done? Let me apologize, I pleaded with my trip. Let me make it okay. I dont want him to be scared, he cant know that I am scared. I am strong and I am fine.
