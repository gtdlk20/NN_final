When IÂ’m through, I toss the apple into the lake and read the first page of a book Steve brought along. I have a hard time doing so, because the words are moving too much for me to focus on them. I put the book down and take out a Magic Eye book. The images are astounding. Liam finds them hilarious, and laughs until he cries. Rene wants to order a pizza. Steve is fascinated by tiny holes in the log upon which we are sitting. Jamie squeals in lysergic bliss.
