 Music played a huge part during the whole experience and really helped set the tone. We listened to all kinds of genres, from psychedelic rock classics, lo-fi to classical, but mainly gravitated towards psytrance, minimal electronic beats and funny or psychedelic music videos. The songs all seemed to coincidentally be about tripping, or we were thinking that all the artist that played them were on drugs. That really cheered as up!
