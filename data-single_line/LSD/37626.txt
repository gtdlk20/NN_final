After a while of listening to them talk, (while I was still tripping) VOOSH, my whole environment changed, and they turned into weird things that were still breathing and talking but some where not human. Greg turned into a chameleon, Hunts was a Big stone human, these girls were sea creatures with flowing green hair, at that point people were trying to interact with me, and every now and then I wouild respond or give them the thumbs up to allay their fears. Then the other group came back and I was still tripping. The feeling I had been feeling before was soo intense I refused to let it go. Then Stew brought me back after a couple rounds of foosball, which he single handedly was owning me and Alex combined. L also helped to bring me back with his girlfriend by just talking to me and stuff. We went back to the room and I was stilll tripping.
