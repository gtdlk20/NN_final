The most confusing part of the trip hadnÂ’t even come yet. Eventually his mom and him stop bickering in confusing Russian words that only continued to confuse me and my friend and this is the period of time when my Russian friend was gonna buy a half ounce of weed or something but without the dealer actually coming inside I guess and without his mom knowing. He might have been doing other weed related business too because of how all over the place he was but this was happening all right next to us while we were continuing to watch T.V. while completely off our heads on acid. While my Russian friend was doing that this is the time when me and my tripping friend really started to lose concept of linear time. Time seemed to no longer happen in a linear fashion and it literally started moving in circles and repeating itself. Time actually started repeating itself and looping it was so confusing and things that only happened once in real life were beginning to happen over and over again multiple times and my Russian friend was in and out of the front door a lot. Well it seemed like a lot..He only went out probably 3 or 4 times but it felt like he went back and fourth like 8 or 10 times or even over a dozen times it was crazy. I got stuck in a time loop while sitting on the couch, both of us did.
