Upon returning home, I wanted nothing more than to lie down and rest.  Sunny tried talking me out of it, I suspect because he didn't want to be alone.  But I couldn't be persuaded.  I went to lie down in bed and watch The Big Lebowski (one of my all time favorites) on my laptop.   For a while I looked at the ceiling of my room in the dark and saw a detailed pattern of pac-man shaped figures, mouths perpetually chomping, filled in with the waving stars and stripes of the American flag.  This was accompanied with apprehension for the election of Barack Obama.  I felt like he was only elected to further the consumption agenda of the political elite who take advantage of the working class to the greatest extent possible.   Wherever there are people willing to work, there are those who will say and do anything to create a life of luxury for themselves on others' sweat and blood, while dismissing the notion of equality.  Money in this case is the means of exploitation.  May God have mercy on the poor souls who have no Idea of the corruption causing their misery and unfulfilled lives.  I pray the tables will turn and the lies will be transparent to the truthful, rendering the liars powerless.
