Overall, I didn't see crazy images or have an tracers.  The only vision things that I saw were my friend's christmas lights in her room- they were blurry and fuzzy- they all blended together.  I didn't freak out or even remotely find anything scary or strange.  I was simply happy and very emotional.  I loved everything about my trip.  I was nervous at frist, however I felt safe with my best friend and knew that I could trust her.  I was in a comfortable environment as well.  However I did have a little trouble falling asleep.  It was strange in the fact that my body was exhausted, yet my mind was still wide awake and racing at 6:00 in the morning.  I was done tripping still I couldn't fall asleep easily.
