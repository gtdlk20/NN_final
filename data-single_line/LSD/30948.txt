I feel so much love right now, I communicated casually. My tone seemed almost sleepy and uninterested, but I figured I was simply physically consumed, and mentally overwhelmed, by the experience. Dont you?! Dianna asked excitedly; she seemed to definitely relate, as her eyes lit up. Theres so much love in this apartment now, I couldnt be any happier! she exclaimed. I simply smiled. Smiling was weird, tense, but so natural. I remember back when we were painting, I couldnt help but smile - like I had to tense up my muscles, and do it. But as I grew more pensive, I felt a decided separation from the come-up to the actual trip. The come-up was happiness, the trip was love. I separated them, deciding that, while happiness was beautiful, this was so much more engaging. Experiencing that much love didnt make me want to smile. No, it just made me more of a sponge, and I just kept absorbing it all around me.
