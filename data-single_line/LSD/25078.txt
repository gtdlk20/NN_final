It was my 18th birthday, I was not planning on tripping or doing anything besides smoking a few buds and going to my kegger. My friends had set up a party for me about a half an hour from the town we live in, in a very small town I had hardly ever been to, in a house I had never been to. We were just getting ready to roll on out when I decided to stop by one of my friends houses to make sure she was still coming to my party and see if she needed a ride. when I walked in her house she was just hanging up the phone and she turned to me and said 'guess what birthday boy, some dose just rolled into town!' Well I had thought acid was my all time favorite drug, I had tripped about eight of nine times before and thought I had this tripping thing down, I was wrong.
