This is when I decided to take the sec  ond hit. It ended up being a very stupid decision because I was called into work. I was a waitress, and this is definitely not something I want to be doing while I'm tripping! I went to work at 3:00 p.m. and worked until about 8. I was very uncomfortable at work because I was sweating a great deal. Perspiration was dripping from my body. One minute I was hot, the next I was cold. I also kept knocking things over. I was a very klutzy waitress. Lets just say I didn't get very good tips that night! One thing I noticed about my experience, which was similiar to shrooms, was my imagination. I would look at something and imagine myself to be somewhere else. As if I were in a movie or a different world. For example, when I looked at a table under this very bright light I imagined I was in a movie. There was a person sitting at that table smoking a bowl. When I was on shrooms, I imagined that while I was walking down the street I was actually in the ocean. I thought the lawn sprinkler was a huge wave. Anyway, let's stay on the subject of LSD....
