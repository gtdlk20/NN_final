I eventually got up and left.  Everything was shifting and melting.  The patterns on the carpet, the blankets on the bed and the patterns on the pillow, even the dog's bed in the corner.  I peeked out the window over the water and was surprised to notice that it looked oddly normal.  I left the room and went to the computer.  The background at the time was a landscape with mountains in the distance and a sun in the sky that had been re-textured in a sort of tie-dye.  The colors bled and swirled.  I switched, with some effort, to a chat window I had left open and attempted briefly to decode what was being said.  I soon left out of boredom.
