IÂ’m not sure what happened next but as I sat there I had this wave of joy, and extreme lack of concern for every thing, as I just experienced pure, simple elementary existence. As far as I could see all that existed was my joy. It was the most peaceful I have ever felt and something I will never forget. I think my friends were getting concerned about me, the ask me if I was ok, I could not even talk I just sat there nodded and smiled. I will never forget that feeling. I think it lasted for 5mins. It was extremely profound. After that extreme high the trip began to decline.
