My recollection is slightly faded of the events on that night. We wandered the house, exploring rooms, and watching the shadows morph and attack each other, forming a vivid and brilliant visual symphony. I felt like a child again, every object having a life of its own bestowed upon it by LSD. Every nerve in my body was suddenly awakened, charged with a glories energy. We may have spent 45-60min wandering the downstairs like 3 doped-up headless chickens. The other two enjoyed the experience also.
