At about 1pm my sister needed my help so she called me. I went into her room and she asked me to unplug and re-plug her TV in. Very simple task, yet so difficult to do when on LSD. I must have been there for 15-20 minutes laughing around, as I usually do when Im around her so she didn't suspect a thing. When I wasn't able to do this simple task, I promised her Id do it tomorrow. When she agreed I felt very relieved.
