As I walked, part of my brain latched onto the fact that my brother was partying at a friend's house that night.  I decided to see if I could find out where the party was.  I had no idea what his friend's name was, where his house was, or what area of the city the house was in.  However, as I walked I began to have images popping into my head (in a sequence that appeared to be random) - A big American Flag.  A silver wristwatch (mine was black).  A Super Nintendo gaming console.  A four foot green glass bong.
