I see the bus closing in to the Montreal bus station and I asked her whether she see what I saw and she replied that she wants to talk about it when we get down from the bus. After we get down with our bags and stuff we stared at each other and started crying and I shouted at her Did  you see that?!. She said yes. I asked Did you see what I just saw?! And her answer was yes. She went into the washroom  of the station for a quick refresh while I was with the bags only to return and say that something was dressing her up and playing with her hair in the washroom while she was washing her face. She felt it viscerally and she hated it but she understood that it didnt mean her harm. I was totally dumbfounded by the experience.
