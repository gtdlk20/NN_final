i was by the window. looking out the window was the strangest thing that i had ever seen. the driver had put some trance on. when walked around on clematis for a while and by this time i was real messed up.  my mind was wandering. colors swirling in and out. tall buildings and trees were amazingly impressive. when we got back to rocky, we wrnt to the park ad i saw the most beautiful tree i had ever seen in my life. i decided to sit in it. by this time my friends were rolling and quite worried about me wandering off. We went back to rocky and actually went in the theater. what happened was amazing. the input to my brain was overwhelming. all the sounds, the sights, everything. then we went to IHOP. we went into the bathroom, and my pupils were quite large. i couldnt help staring at the stalls. they were the most beautiful shade of purple i had ever seen in my life.  strange rainbow patters, like a metal grid, covered everything. we got a ride home from the most beautiful guy i had ever seen in my life, and i was quite in love with him. when we got home it was about 4:30 AM. One of my friends who was rolling, had some shrooms. we then decided to go outside and explore.
