During my nausea my boyfriend took my hand and told me that I had to relax, to go with it, to not try to control my trip but let it control me. Time immediately began to slow down immensely and I laughed and exclaimed how he just slowed time down like that. The posters on my walls were all very fascinating. The Beatles watching me trip and gag, which I didn't appreciate much, my map of Paris which swirled together in beautiful ways, a piece of art... mostly though, my hand was subject to stare at as I focused in on it and let the colorful patterns close in around it. I began to regain physical stability as I willed myself to not gag at every thought I had of anything remotely gross or nausea-inducing. My boyfriend and I tripped together as my friend C tried to keep us happy. A and I though were completely somewhere else, laughing at nearly everything, even if it wasn't funny.
