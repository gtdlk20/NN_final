So after showering, cleaning myself up, and putting on some clothes I had put out for tripping, Summer and I took one tab at around 8:20PM, supposedly 250ug each. Putting them under our tongue we left them there for around 5 minutes or so before swallowing them with a little bit of water. After that we chilled, talked about random stuff and what we expected to happen, ate some food, set up our VR headsets in advance to make it easy in case we wanted to get on, and waited for the effects to start.
