The day is finally over I tell myself as I sit down in my car.  C breaks out a bag of chips and a 2 liter of Dr. Pepper.  I completely forgot about them and I start laughing.  I'm having much more fun in my car than I had at cedar point the past couple hours.  S immediately passes out in the back seat.  He didn't sleep the night before because he was up doing the acid that we were supposed to do at Cedar Point.
