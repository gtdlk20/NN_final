Furthermore, I felt a bit of ego death.. I didnt know who I am in the universe, confused,startled, -->  :o  :huh:  :blink:  .. I largely wanted to express myself somehow, so I managed to find peace of mind in painting.. Just with a pencil, my hands were doing some sort of fractals, geometrical shapes and I was trying to concetrate and relax, fuel my energy somewhere..
