I was sick of being inside I had such a yearning for the outdoors so everyone else stayed inside and I went outside and sat at a table by myself and watched a tree/bush across his yard for a while....the bush started swirling into infinityand it changed into a dragon swirling a few times it was wonderfully beautiful, but after about 1:30 or so I went back inside to socialize...
