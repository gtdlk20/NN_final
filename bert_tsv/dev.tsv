1	0	a	The hallucinations did not intensify in the same way that LSD does as you begin to peak, and the side effects were much less severe. I felt relaxed, comfortable, and mellow. I sensed that the mushroom was alive and with me, but I felt detached from the world and everything but my consciousness. Everything seemed unreal and unimportant. It was at about this point that our friend suggested we try some Nitrous.
2	0	a	My husband did the first balloon. He sat with his eyes closed, smiling, for about 30 seconds, and came out of it laughing. He tried to explain what it had done to him but words seemed inadequate. He then joined our friend in trying to convince me to try it, but I didn't want to. A voice explained to me, 'That's not what this trip is about.' My husband did two more balloons, and seemed, for lack of better words, blown away by them.
3	0	a	I began to slip back into a trance, and the serious work of my trip was begun in silence. Our friend put on some music, and I occasionally drifted out of the trance to ponder the strangeness of the lyrics. My consciousness was shown to me as a 3-dimensional board game with amazing multicolored passageways and columns. Together with the other entities, I began to play the game of Me. I started examining my interpersonal relationships and saw some large mistakes I had been making- the voices showed me, in a kindly way, that I had been selfish, neurotic, and guilty of perpetuating bad karma. My bitterness, resentment and anger were shown to me as a parasite I needed to let go of, and I did. I was overwhelmed with inner peace and joy. My ego slowly faded away and I felt like I was part of the Vibration of the All. 
4	0	a	As the peak ended, I started reconstructing my personality, and I was shown further work that needed to be done. Our friend went home, and my husband and I discussed what we had experienced as best we could. We smoked some marijuana, and the trip came to an end. I decided that the trip, although scary at times, was definitely a highly positive experience, and I felt a strong urge to thoroughly explore the strange world of psilocybin.

7	0	a	Through out my history of psychedelic use, I have never been as privileged as I have been recently. A few days ago, me and a friend imbibed some mushroom tea. About 45 minutes after initially drinking the potion, I began to feel the familiar body high. A light, wavy feeling in the extremities and a hallow feeling in the torso and abdomen. Eventually, the movie we'd put in ended and the other people (not on psychedelics, just MJ) went to sleep. We remained up until 4 or 5 chatting about life. We figured out some things about what everybody wants and what really happens out in the world, away from my or your little world. It was then when my trip took an unfamiliar turn. Suddenly I felt as if we had accessed a universal reality. By this I mean, we had, in our altered states of awareness, transcended rational thought and witnessed a universal truth) The truth can't be described with language, but rather experienced directly or not at all. I urge everyone to find their psychedelic of choice and trip with this in mind. LSD, DMT (which I've yet to try), Mushrooms, or combinations of these or other drugs which have no reasonable overdose level. Enter the trip with no fear of dying or going mad, realize it is the fear itself that will drive you mad, Overcome your fears by living right and treating people kindly. You will then be brave enough to see what it is that we all feel, but few understand.

9	0	a	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
10	0	a	Wow is one word that perfectly describes my first experience with shrooms. Pot has been a part of my life for a few years now, and I have always been curious to see what shrooms would do to me. I had only heard good things about it and was ready to try it, but somehow never got round to it. Well it happened like this:
11	0	a	One typical day, I was at a friends room, just smoking pot and relaxing with a few of my friends. Another friend came in and said he had shrooms, I imediately knew I was going to try it once and for all. I consumed maybe 1/16th of an ounce, and just sat there talking and waiting for the fungus to take effect. I didn't really feel it for like a half hour, but then it hit me. It went suddenly from relaxing to very intense in the room. 
12	0	a	I was immediately removed from reality and thrown into my own little, lonely world. I was rolling, I mean i was totally rolling, over and over again. I was confusing myself and sort of flipping out. I was trapped in fear in a world that i thought I could not get out of, but desperately wanted to. I remember thinking, what I would give to have things normal again. I was freaking out. I started jabbering on, and really felt that I was annoying the others in the room. I wanted to stop and just chill, but couldn't. I hudled up in a corner of a couch and just kept talking to myself, convinced that I was going through a bad trip. It was way to intense for me to even look around the room and try and see visuals.
13	0	a	My friends then picked me up and said that we all should go for a walk. Suddenly, my whole trip flipped upside down and I felt great, like a million bucks.....a billion bucks. The world had never been better, and I was ready to do anything. We all went into the basement and danced like crazy. It was great. I was seeing the sorroundings perfectly, things were spinning, I was just great.
14	0	a	I ended up going to bed eight hours or so after I consumed the shrooms. I was still seeing small visuals when going to sleep. It was great. I woke up, had no side effects whatsoever.
15	0	a	I intend to try shrooms again, hoping that the next time I do them, I won't have as an intense beginning. I definitely recommend that you try it once. Pot still remains my drug of choice, but shrooms may jump in my life once in a while.

17	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Small Group (2-9) (17)
18	0	a	Setting: Separate 4-person cabin at a hostel, relatively far from other people. Mattresses & sleeping bags on floor, CD/cassette player and plenty of music. Fresh snow, forest, open fields and lake right outside, with temperature just barely below 0Â°C. Excellent setting! 
19	0	a	Time: Started at 20:30 (+0), lasted until 02:00 (+5.5)
20	0	a	Descriptions of experience have been given by all 4 people present, and I think this shows nicely how individual tolerance to the drug and mental set can change a trip's character even when the dosage and the setting are identical. For example, note how the weather outside was 'beautiful' to Ei and 'pristine' to J, but only 'a little strange' to Ea and positively 'dreadful' to K. Similarly, the effect of the music was interesting, with some people concentrating on it entirely and for others it being just background.
21	0	a	In the 'header' of each description, I've indicated the tripper's level of experience with psychedelics, and given an approximate rating of the trip's 'psychedelic level' on a scale of 0-5. The trips are ranked in approximate order of cosmicity, from a strong level 3 to a mostly level 1-2 experience.
22	0	a	A detailed, accurate description of what I saw, felt and experienced during my maiden trip into the wonderful world of 'mushies' is impossible. Some of the visions that appeared into my mind were so vivid, so full of colors and so different, that words are not enough to explain them.
23	0	a	We started to ingest the grained mushies at around 8:30. As this was my first time, I felt hyper and excited, even a little nervous. The actual ingestion was no problem; the mushrooms - despite a yucky smell - did not really taste like anything, and it was easy to swallow them with water. During the first few minutes nothing happened. I even tried to meditate with Ea, but it was rather impossible to concentrate. Then (probably after 15-30 minutes; I couldn't track time), I started to feel a strange, yet nice tingling sensation moving in waves around my body. I closed my eyes, and the tingling changed into a feeling of 'heaviness,' I felt languid and at ease. Then the tingling sensation took over again, this time stronger, and I sensed a light buzziness in my head. I opened my eyes, and focused on the little, round, white fire alarm situated on the ceiling right above me. I began to see tiny red and green squares dancing in front of my eyes. All of a sudden there was a red flash of light. It was in the shape of a small, 'multi-horned' star, that blinked for a fraction of a second and then disappeared. Wow! I closed my eyes, thinking 'Here we go...,' and the letters fused into squares that sank down as if forming a staircase...
24	0	a	Then all kinds of weird and exciting figures started to form in psychedelic colors ranging from light green to violet and red. They were of numerous shapes, but each seemed to follow a certain pattern, much like those found on Japanese or Chinese paintings (a lot of beautiful flower-like structures).
25	0	a	I swallowed and realised that I could actually feel the saliva moving down my oesophagus (it did not feel gross at all). The oesophagus, however, resembled a water pipe, and at the end there was actually a cute, little tap, ready to be turned on! The saliva was coming out of it in drops, and falling into my stomach, which was - indeed - a pool of water. Simultaneously
26	0	a	I felt my left big toe transforming into a thick white arrow, that began to spiral upwards! At this point I was still able to discuss what I saw with the others, and we laughed at each others' observations. Every time I opened my eyes, I could see the flashy star (which I had named 'my little red thing'). It made me feel calm and peaceful, and drove away the twinge of fear I occasionally still felt. This star was, in fact, to be my 'guardian angel,' to which I could return in between my jumps from one world (or scenery) to another. In my mind, I could analyse almost everything I saw, and felt to have a certain control of which figures to look at (yes, I have read Castaneda!).
27	0	a	All this time we had been listening to Orb. As the mushies started to have a tighter grip (iik!) on us, we decided to switch on some meditative music. Correct choice! I can't tell when the music started to control my thoughts, but as I neared the peak of the trip, my visions changed acccording to the music. Beautiful sceneries, each colored according to the particular song being heard, entered my mind, and I let go... The feeling that was to follow was the most beautiful, warm, safe, amazing euphoria, that could never be expressed in words. All I can say is that I was floating in a roundish space, colored light blue (but unlike any blue I had seen before), filled with beautiful, soothing things I thought were strawberries! I completely lost track of time -hell, I lost track of myself! I was snuggled warmly under my blanket, feeling perfectly safe and comfortable. The music seemed to cradle me in her arms, rocking me the way a mother rocks her child.
28	0	a	My fingers were in contact with something warm and soft, like the fur of a bear, and this added to the feeling of security (I did vaguely realize that this fur was in fact K's hair (!), but that had no meaning whatsoever). I was floating, floating, floating... But as soon as I became conscious of what was happening, the feeling of utter happiness subsided. I could still sense what had happened, but no longer felt it. The blue world seemed to slip away. The song ended, and the next piece brought with it a light green world that was filled with flute/violin music. I could actually see the blue world leaving me, fading into the distance below. A helpless longing filled me; I did not want to lose touch with the blue world, but knew that I had. I felt like crying, but no tears came. I felt sad, helpless and alone. The song ended. The next piece of music transported me into yet a new world, into a series of new worlds, in fact. Every time the music changed, I entered a different world. I have only vague flashbacks of those worlds, one of them being a beige one, where beautiful flowers danced ballet wrapped around one another...
29	0	a	At one point the scenery in front of my eyes turned into a purple sunset, in which a strangely beautiful woman (nymph?) was doing a strangely beautiful, swaying dance. Much to my amazement the nymph was suddenly transformed into one of my closest friends with whom I had unfortunately lost contact and whom I worried about. I was overcome by a joyous feeling; I knew that my friend was fine, and that she could somehow feel my presence, as well.
30	0	a	I opened my eyes for a while, and for some reason began to examine my fingers. To tell the truth, they were no longer fingers, but like the horns of a black starfish, wavering in the swing of the ocean's waves. When I put my hand into a fist, again, it turned into a yellow lotus, which came to full bloom as I slowly uncurled my fingers. The thought of my body as the body of a human being disgusted me.
31	0	a	I closed my eyes and entered a new world. I can remember a dark blue, thick wave that swept along with it everything that it contacted. Suddenly a collection of dead animals, preserved for show, appeared in my eyes. I stared at each animal in the eyes, feeling utter hopelessness and pity towards them. Despite the fact that they were dead, there was a feeling of togetherness. No wonder I'm a vegetarian!
32	0	a	Most of the time I was feeling either fine or euphorious (physically), but there was a time when I felt as if someone was tearing my guts apart. There was a feeling of acute pain, and I started to get a bit panicky. But as I faced the ceiling and saw 'my little red thing' again, the pain subsided, and I felt fine. Slight feelings of nausea did appear once in a while, but they lasted only for short monets.
33	0	a	The peak of the trip had evidently passed (23:00?). I still had some hallucinations, but mostly we just fooled around with various 'trip toys' that we had brought along. Interesting. I felt hungry, and decided to peel an orange. I felt sorry for it, and despite the beauty(!) of the flesh, felt bad about eating it...
34	0	a	We decided to take a walk outside. I saw everything in a new light, and the nature looked more beautiful than ever. I threw myself on the snow, and felt the earth round up around me. There was no clear division between the sky and the land. Woooow...
35	0	a	I could go on forever. It is, however, such an impossible task to describe all the visions and sensations, that I won't even try. The trip was totally different from what I had expected, but then again, certain parts of it greatly exceeded my wildest hopes. Despite the fact that I had stomach aches throughout the following morning, I was more than satisfied with the mushies + felt energetic and happy. I still keep on bursting to laughter all of a sudden. Strangely enough, none of the other trippers had experienced anything so earth-moving. Do I recommend this for others? Hell, yes! Nothing will ever be quite the same again...
36	0	a	After getting comfy, we all munched on the mushroom powder and washed it down with 7-Up and water. Within 15 minutes, the first physical effects of slight queasyness, heavy weight and drowsiness could be felt, and the first CD of The Orb's _Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld_ was popped in the player. Red-green-blue blips soon appeared, as well as tiny floating boxes of the by now familiar pattern that seems to only occur with Ps. cubensis:
37	0	a	_________ |o o o o o| (blips of green and red alternating in vertical rows, |o o o o o| background of box metallic light blue, the box floating |o_o_o_o_o| at an angle against a black background)
38	0	a	I relaxed and let my mind drift, and the first hour passed surprisingly rapidly. Other than the RGB-blips there were practically no visuals, just the faintest hint of 'wave interference'-type patterns in the background with eyes closed. The only detail I still remember was the sound of a jumbo jet passing overhead; the immense, building noise filled my head completely for a few seconds. The Orb was then changed to _Meditative Music_, a CD of reworked Chinese meditation tunes, which was absolutely brilliant. The music transported me to another world. While I could not really _see_ where I was, I could _feel_ the music, the emotion behind every note of saxophone or flute, and even though I speak no Chinese I could understand the singer's chant as an expression and celebration of the joy and ecstasy of existence. Words fail me here, I cannot describe my state of mind other than to say that it was incredible.
39	0	a	When the CD ended it was around +2, and the second CD of Orb was popped in the player, starting from the third track. (My time sense was gone, I am dating the events by the lengths of the CDs.) By now, the peak of the trip was ending, and we were all starting to play around with the various triptoys we had brought. Stuffed animals, especially my big fluffy sheep Flossy, were tons of fun when petted, hugged or thrown at other people. Kooshes felt completely cosmic as well, although it was too dark to see the pretty colors or the wobbling of the little strands. Ea's braided long hair felt extremely strange, with the individual braids feeling like little squishy wooden beads tied together. I was starting to pay attention to my body again, after basically forgetting its existence for two hours, and now it felt like it formed a network with my mind at the center. My mind could 'ping' each body part, for example my big toe, which would then twitch and send back a status report describing the surroundings in surreal detail. 'Roger, brain, left big toe here! Sending out exterior probes... A-ha, we are currently leaning against what appears to be a wall, whose tactile nature resembles that of wood. Estimated distance to right foot 10 centimeters. Over and out...'
40	0	a	At +3 the few hallucinations I had had were almost all gone and we decided to go outside. Getting up and getting dressed was difficult since coordination was less than optimal, but we managed it and stumbled outside into a world covered in pristine, white snow. I tasted some, it was fluffy and delicious. After walking around outside the cabin a bit, admiring the tactile squishyness of mud underneath the snow, we decided to go take a look at the lake. We made a detour to the bathrooms, where the hot-air dryer and a stream of water falling from the roof proved to be fascinating, and then continued on our way. A bank of snow maybe half a foot deep on the side of the road proved to be a formidable obstacle, but I gathered my courage and stomped across it and Ea and Ei followed, K having returned to the cabin to listen to more music. Ei then collapsed into the snow, lying on her back and staring at the sky, and Ea & I went to investigate a strange sight. In the middle of the field there was a circle of stone, with a metal grid in the middle. I'm still not quite sure what it was, suggestions ranged from an alien artifact to an outdoor grill for munchkins to a well designed for sunbathing. (Concept.)
41	0	a	Ei then returned from the dead and we trudged onward towards the expanse of ice, with some scary moments when going down a hill which has drifts of up to a foot of snow in parts. We reached the lake, and were mystified by a strange field around us covered in positively alien geometric shapes: triangles, pyramids, circles, octagons. We were also a bit unsure about where the land ended and the ice started, so we erred on the side of caution. Ei flopped into the snow again and we went to explore the mysterious shapes, which turned out to be a miniature golf course. Pretending to be a golf ball and walking around the course was amusing.
42	0	a	We were getting a bit cold, so we headed back, but only after stopping at a children's playground and testing out the swings, which were, as expected, extremely crunchy. Once we got back, the effects were starting to subside, so Ei peeled a few oranges (naturally causing lots of joking 'Help! Don't peel me! EEEEK!'-comments around the room). The oranges were quite tasty, even if the orange peels reconstructed into a hollow sphere did look rather unhappy. I tried to read a book of poetry, but it wasn't too extraordinary. At around +5, K & Ei headed back outside and Ea & I attempted to sleep, which was an exercise in futility, so we just talked about what had happened, it being finally possible to do so without bursting into paroxysms of giggling every three words. Eventually K & Ei returned and we all drifted off to sleep, ending what was for me a very pleasant, albeit not breathtaking, trip.
43	0	a	Setting was a nice cabin by a lake and mostly perfect were it not for the dreadful weather outside: the night turned out gloomy and wet. The day prior to ingestion had been occupied by various activities and on the whole the day was not IMHO the best day. I would have postponed it by a week but the arrangements were carried out because three other people were attending.
44	0	a	The powdered dry shrooms were easily swallowed with the aid of 7UP. The carbonated drink resulted in an odd burpy feeling in the stomach. The taste was distinctly shroomy. Actual noticeable effects came surprisingly early; after 20 minutes of ingestion an increasing awareness came over me. Sorta of like an awakening to reality: hey! I am going to trip now. The initial reactions were of intense anticipation and the rushing feeling of familiar effects was purely euphoric. Quickly, however, I came to realize that the dose (around 6ml of fine powder) was actually very low but definitely higher than on my 2nd trip (1 lvl). This caused my joyfulness to reduce dramatically as last time, for my expectations were higher.
45	0	a	The trip itself proceeded with a very mild peak, visuals being almost negligible. Thought activity was also quite slow, perhaps due to the mild depression I had had all day. Thoughts ran along a single line and I could not concentrate on the music. My physical position during the trip was in the most awkward of postures, nevertheless I was successful in forgetting my body. The trip was extremely low in any kind of revelations or the sort, for I was not set for meditation. Only a few things of significance crossed my mind: if only I could get hold of some DMT - let it be the only and sufficient motive why I would study to be a chemist. Also, I confronted another minor problem of mine. This might sound schizophrenic, but it is actually nothing really serious. Sometimes I think I have two mes: one living life and socialising and enjoying, feeling, the real me, and sometimes I sort of flip to this other more undesirable state of mind: I am confused, unsociable, more afraid of everything, criticizing the actions and thoughts of the other self, watching my own physical actions and almost everything else very evil and unwanted. This other me seemed to occur when I was fundamentally depressed a few weeks ago with a lot of pressure due to the upcoming exams. This same state faced me during the trip at certain times
46	0	a	with a much greater intensity and I was able to analyse it. Without going into details it seems the trip seemed to help me keep away this other state or more like 'make friends' with it. Consequently, it has never occurred since for the past week. Perhaps the only good thing during the trip was this psychologic insight into schizophrenic cases where the identity has sort of separated into two or more. It also serves well to understand other people with similar problems.
47	0	a	Music was not very good during the trip, for I was feeling quite low. The Eastern meditative music which is almost excellent sounded actually very boring. My physical body was feeling very lethargic and somewhat shaky. I was dreaming of the next upcoming rave and how I could have spent this trip time more usefully dancing rather than suffering in this condition. Although the trip was not very successful, the happiness and mood changes it brought about as post-trip effects were highly rewarding.
48	0	a	The DMT desire during the trip goes to show that I was looking for something much more intense. My first trip on shrooms was without doubt the best most incredible experience I have ever met. With a marvelous setting and all, the revelatory content was extremely high. I saw myself as virtually nothing in the whole universe and the tremendous unity with all of it - this on the other hand brought the greatest euphoria I have ever felt and was carried on for many months to come. It totally blasted my life at that time. In comparison, the third trip was nothing and very superficial. Ei who had a first-time experience in mind-expansion was totally bewildered and had a truly good trip. It goes to show, that doses do not necessarily have to be large and effects are highly individual dependent. The trip was very visual-free which again subsided the euphoric side to everything. Visuals were more like square pixels forming figures, which I thought were not very interesting. Again the first trip had been swarming with color and spirals with a great intensity.
49	0	a	A post-trip comment after 2.5 weeks: Mood changes have been quite dramatic at times. Sometimes feeling highly elated and sometimes dreadfully depressed. A week ago I suffered mentally from bad schizophrenic depression. Thinking became very superficial and highly critical of myself. As if I could not concentrate on anything. Doing something interesting or getting something to 'boot' life helped me out of this state into a much more desirable state. Feels as if life is smiling again. Now that I have my final exams coming, my thought activity is safely bound to these realms. Escapism rules.
50	0	a	I picked Ei up at her house before we were meeting K and J. Talking about our feelings, it was clear that we were both a little nervous, since this was the first trip for both of us. I had expected myself to be hyped up, as always when I am about to experience something new and stimulating. However, as I had spent the day trying to smoothen and open my mind and to meditate, I was very calm.
51	0	a	After settling down at the small, yet cozy cabin by a frozen lake, I proceeded with some meditation practices with Ei while K and J went out to buy batteries for the CD-player. Again, I experienced a slight calming effect.
52	0	a	When K and J had returned, we swallowed the mushroom powder with 7up and water. I had high hopes for what I was about to experience. After about a half an hour the others started to voice their strange sensations and visual effects. This annoyed me a little, since my vision was unaffected. However, I could feel myself sway in a wave-like motion, the waves moving along my body from feet to head. When I talked to the others about my lack of visual effects, they suggested that I simply concentrate on the music.
53	0	a	We were all lying down silently in the dark room, listening first to Orb, then to Meditative Music. Too often I let my thoughts wonder off to the people present and what they might be experiencing. For example, when an aeroplane flew by, I listened to the others voicing their awe. However, I heard it simply as the passing of a large aeroplane. I also had a tuft of someone's hair in my hand, this human contact being distractively lovely and comforting. At some point I lost my human contact, which brought some memories of the past into my mind and made me sad. It also gave me the ability to 'feel' within myself a fact of life in which I had believed already before, yet only rationally. Then I started thinking about trips of which I had been told earlier. I recalled hearing how high expectations and the subsequent let-down can make you miss much of a trip and cause sustained depression. Also, underrating a trip by assuming you are in a normal state of mind can lead to problems. Consequently, I pulled myself together and decided to make the trip the best it could be. I suppose it was still quite early on the others' trips. However, for me, it was only the beginning.
54	0	a	I went into myself, concentrating on me only. I put all my effort into taking pleasure in myself. I enjoyed the sensation of extreme, sensuous warmth, being cuddled up in my sleeping bag. Concepts such as being in the womb of Mother Earth and similar experiences by Allen Ginsberg came into mind. I noticed that the imaginative potential of my mind had increased significantly. For example, with only little effort I could vividly imagine myself being in the womb of Mother Earth. However, I could still easily rationalize that I was, in fact, not in Mother Earth's womb. The nature of the experience can be described to some extent in the following way: I felt, for example, what it would be like to smell Mother Earth, but I did not actually smell her.
55	0	a	However, the most important aspect of the trip was the music, Meditative Music, to be precise. Simply saying that I could feel the music is a crude understatement. Yet there is no other way of describing what the music meant to me. I appreciated and venerated every note at a time. There was communication between us as each note spoke to me. It was as if I was celebrating something, companied by the music. The duration of each piece of music was insignificant, although I did not even pay any attention to such a matter. However, one piece slowed down noticeably near the end.
56	0	a	When the CD came to an end, Orb was put on. It did not have the same effect on me as Meditative Music had had. By this time the peak of the trip was over, and the others started talking and playing with trip toys (ie. throwing them at me). By concentrating, I still tried to recreate the intensity of what I had just felt in the music, but with limited success.
57	0	a	After a while we went out. Although my senses were quite normal, the surroundings seemed a little strange. Exploring the environment was intriguing. The strange feeling diminished all night and was practically gone the next morning. Instead, I felt joy and happiness, which coincided with beauty of the early- spring morning.
58	0	a	POST-TRIP FEELINGS: I have experienced a regression back to adolescence on an emotional level [Oh no, not again!]. My feelings have ranged from depression to elation, initially with a period of about half a day of each. I have also noticed unusual responsiveness to different hormonal levels, and have occasionally responded to music with unexpected vigor. Fortunately, after a couple of weeks and a few teen-like stunts, I seem to have become my normal (?) self again.
59	0	a	CONCLUSION: The trip was very comfortable and stimulating, although not as intense (only level 1) as I had expected. I would not want to have missed it, though, and I definitely want to trip on a higher dose in the future.

61	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
62	0	a	At about 7:30 P.M., I walked a short distance with my family to a friend's apartment, where I ingested about 5 grams of powdered mushrooms in orange juice. After I choked down as much of the mushrooms as I could (About 1/4 of a gram remained- I was certain that if I tried to finish the remaining dose I would vomit), I returned to my apartment, leaving my family at our friend's apartment. I had eaten only half of a sandwich that day, and I anticipated that the effects would set in relatively quickly.
63	0	a	How right I was. Within fifteen minutes, the effects of the mushrooms were obvious. I laid down, the light pulsing, and found myself uncontrollably swept away into a trance, after which point I started writing (rather illegibly, I might add) in my notebook. I was not entirely sure what I was actually writing, and I don't exactly remember writing any of it, but I knew at the time that it was extremely important. The following is an exerpt from my automatic scribbles
64	0	a	'Am I alone? / We are never alone ... Dolphin brains / The grey matter /this is the fabric of our existance / There is only one thought / I have already written these things many times / All of this is a spark /Everything Is / Everything Becomes'
65	0	a	I found the 'Everything Becomes' remark to be very striking, and I giggled at the comment for quite a while..
66	0	a	This is the part of the trip where my memory starts to get a little fuzzy.
67	0	a	I remember getting a shower, grinning and laughing like a 4-year old. I was saying things like 'I can do whatever I want, if I don't like it, I can change it..' over and over again. Sometimes, I couldn't tell if my eyes were opened or closed, the visual hallucinations being very intense (The lights were even turned on).. I turned off the water, but remained in the shower for an undetermined amount of time. I remained naked, and found my way out to the living room, where I laid down on the couch.
68	0	a	I laid perfectly flat on the couch, absolutely still. I felt as if I was nothing, the Universe was nothing, and all I had to do was simply Be. I spent a great deal of time Being. 
69	0	a	I emerged from the trance, unsure of who I was, where I was, what was going on, or why I felt the way I did. I had a number of disturbing thoughts, such as 'I must be dead- I've always known it would happen to me, here it is..' I saw my 3-month old daughter, and heard a voice telling me that I had, in a way, become her, and that I might as well be dead because I had fulfilled my purpose on this planet. Still yet another voice was telling me that I was not actually dead, but was just now experiencing life for the first time. Another voice told me that the Universe had just came to an explosive and violent end and that I was sitting in the twisted wreckage, and another voice told me that I was entirely responsible for its destruction. Confused and frightened, I threw on some pants and a sweater and ran as fast as I could to get my family.
70	0	a	I arrived at my friend's apartment in a matter of seconds, and found that there were a couple of our other friends over there as well. I don't remember much from being over there, except that I occasionally would forget that I was at his apartment, and that I was actually at my apartment instead (The layouts of our apartments are nearly identical).. I almost walked into his roommate's room a couple times, thinking that it was actually MY room (they are in the same relative location). Later on that night, my wife would inform me that I smoked some cannabis while I was over there and wrapped myself up in a blanket, but I do not have any recollection of these events.. I was sure that I had taken off my clothes while I was over there, too, but my wife assures me I did not. I was also informed, later on, that there were two people over there smoking Salvia earlier that night, and now I wonder if that could possibly account for some of the disassociative quality of my trip.
71	0	a	We returned home, and I was still unsure as to the 'who, what, when, where, why, and how' of the situation. My wife asked me some questions, but I wasn't entirely sure what she was saying, and kind of just went 'uhhhhh... uh huh..' and nodded my head. It was then that I remembered that I had written some things in my notebook, so I grabbed it, hoping that it would help jog my memory. I found that I was unable to read, and was becoming more and more certain that I was clinically braindead. I did not remember taking the mushrooms, and thought that I felt the way I did because I had recently quit smoking tobacco.
72	0	a	I slowly phased back into 'normal' reality, but I would not be completely rematerialized until I woke up from a good nights sleep. I feel that I missed an important part of the trip (the 'reconstruction' phase), and next time I would like to have another person around to help keep me from getting too lost. When I went into the trip initially, I had a very focused mind, I was certain of that- but by the end I felt that my consciousness had been sent through an atomic coffee grinder. Confusion reigned, and I was unable to hold my pieces together. I can only imagine what it must have been like for my friends to see me in that state of mind, since I do not really remember anything I said to them..
73	0	a	If I had to summarize this trip into two words, they would be 'confusion' and 'strange'. But, despite the harsh descriptions I have provided, it was not a trip that I would group into the 'bad' category. I feel that even though I was unsure as to who I was or what the hell was happening to me for a good chunk of the trip, I learned a lot from this experience and would jump at the opportunity to try it again, albeit I probably need a month or two for the lessons learned to completely sink in.

77	0	a	6:01pm Began ingesting 1.53 grams dried mixed with 1 can of tuna. Ick! sand! Chewing pretty well.. would do better but the sand is annoying Getting OJ to wash everything down with... Put some Yes on, and finding a ds9 episode to watch.
78	0	a	6:14 Completed ingestion. Watching ds9. Or not. recorded it wrong. Drank a glass of OJ. Put cool music video on instead ;-)
79	0	a	6:20 Maybe +1. A couple alerts. Chill. Bzzt on left eye. A little body effect. 
80	0	a	6:25 A little buzzing in ears... some body energy perhaps.
81	0	a	6:28 Unignorable effect... buzzing, heavy limbs arms seem kinda long... neat! Feeling some more body energy.. like restlessness....
82	0	a	6:32 Massive energy.... really rushy actually. Realized I don't have to write EVERYTHING into here. this is just a little log... I can go anywhere or do whatever, and it won't show in this record....! 
83	0	a	6:38 Played with the flashlight for a little while. We're here! Seriously +2!!!!! Fairly equivalent to [previous very mild 1st experience]... i think... but not sure. Still seems to be building.
84	0	a	6:41 Urge to take a walk. Some nausea. But really zinging, all in all!
85	0	a	6:46 Wouldn't even think of driving at this point... thoughts are lucid but there is so much more stuff interesting than this need to type.... 
86	0	a	6:49 Can't beleive how much energy,. neat idea for an sf story... drug which makes the safety curcuit in your head go... so you can get into infinite loops!!! 
87	0	a	SO MUCH ENERGY.... A little interested in open eye visuals but can't get them going CEVs are somewhat interesting...pink and white brain coral things... 
88	0	a	(Post Call) Okay to talk to but things are really moving faster and faster right now... arms seems a zillion miles away. the keyboard is so amazingly small, this is cool! I wonder if my blood pressure is up, cuz I can see things popping out on my hands a bit... interesting... should really have medical equipment so SOMEONE can figure out what this does to your body... mind you, right now I don't mind what's going on. But I can imagine being in a state where I WOULD!
89	0	a	7:12 ENERGY CITY! Standing is fucking hilarious! I keep over amping my motions.... like overcorrecting would casue a fall... this is REALLY COOL. 
90	0	a	7:28 +3!!!!! It's too much to do to keep typing!
91	0	a	7:44 Music is wonderful.. the energy is a pleasant if a little demanding. The urge to let the mind wander into all sorts of interesting places tends to be very strong but the urge to write everythng down so I can look at it while I am striaght. Also overwhelms I am aware of all the viens in my hands and the speed with which I am tyyping is terribly intersting... the veins are really wierd... But the music and everything is the GREATEST... plus the tenetion in my arms from the awkard way I am writing.
92	0	a	7:55 I can see how this can be overwhelming.. the energy is amazing.. you just have to let it go, and hang with everything.... it's so pleasant. but you can't force it ... just hang tight and enjoy the RIDE!!!!! wow.

94	0	a	8:34 REVELATION! I have many many expectations and aways of looking at people which express the inherent negativity of the situation. But, why don't I look at things instead with an air of HOW MUCH THEIR CURENT SITUATION IS VIEWED BY THEM AS PSOSITIVE.... AND PERHAPS BY LOOKING AT THINGS FROM THE 'THINGS ARE FINE' PERSPECTIVE, I CAN GET SOME INSIGHT INTO HOW I MIGHT DIRECT MY OWN LIFE TOAWARD A SIT
95	0	a	Stop expecting everyone to share your perspective of how miserable their existance is. Nah. its not that dramatic... but I have a flair for the bold... huh. way from this... look at how other perceive things as positive,... and stop epecting everyone to share your perspective of how miserable their existance is. Nah. its not that dramatic.,.. but I have a flair for the bold... huh.
96	0	a	8:37 Typing this is SOOOOOOO neat I can disconnect my mind from the method of expression which is the words coming out of the fingers on the ends of my hands... I wonder if what am typing makes any sense? wowowowowowowow
97	0	a	[ I think I typed straight for about 20 minutes at this point. ]
98	0	a	The warmth of the notebook on my lap. the focus and every with which I interract with everything I wish I knew this keyboard better because it is a limited way to express myself because I know I am not hitting the correct keys all of the time. Howver, I am getting better, I beleive with every passing second. I know I am working harder to hit the correct keys, and it seems easier than before to do the right thing and let my hands wander over the keys but how to harness this kind of energy... not really any way... its just something you can experience. but then you have to let it go. Intersting as hell. So many inhibitions completely gone. I can type this and know I WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT LATER... BUT PARTS OF MY BRAIN ARE WATCHING THE REST OF THE WORD (Damn!) Or rather, are watching what I am doing instead of just GOING with it.... there's always this 'EGO' observer of what you are doing and making sure it's okay. Somehow part of that is somewhat disconnected when I type like this because I can just let everything go and keep things going... the hands are now the observer recording wherever my mind is (just closd my eyes) however the world pulsates... a fish swimming.. silver... angles jumpsuit THIS IS SO FUNNY TO REREAD EVEN NOW!!!!!!! heheheheh! it will be nice to rest thgouh.. the effort that must come into taking an LSD trip where you are on the road for HOURS AND HOURS. I am somewhat exhausted by all this... but it's ok. The lightening outside is VERY surreal... the light from the notebook demands attention but the outside clouds swarm by the two trees (I couldn't write this way straight, because I wouldn't be able to suitably let go of that ego thing I WAS THINKING ABOUT EARLIER.)
99	0	a	NOTE THAT MY TYPING IS MORE OR LESS EXACTLY IN SP(AJHGRGHRG!) [I mistyped and was annoyed, I think. Speed?] with my thoughts. I can slow down or I can type fast. There is a need to be fast becaise I know this state won't be here forever... but there might be something to bring back with the looking at things positively thing... It's amazing tht I can make my hands be this disconnected organ capable of typing whwtaever I send at them... never protesting but knowing when things are a litle too much and de,amdmg tjay tjeu ne et slow down so tjeu cam ne accirate agaom [demanding that ??? slow down so they can be accurate again] Wow.
100	0	a	Not accurate at all. Much easier with the eyes open. This will be so STUPID to read later... but its fun right now... which IS the point, isn't it? WHO DO I expect to judge me? Or do I judge myself,.. this is silly... but this is getting at something important I think I am understanding this whole trip thing now... it really lets you look at things in a straightforward way,... the music is fine... but the ability to type and to reflect on what is being thought is FACINATING!.................. I can't abstract too much. I feel this need to type evething. 
101	0	a	If I ERASED THISS I WOULD NEVER KNOW WHAT I WROTE!!! But, would I even remember that I had wanted to rease it. This ability to type is cool cool its just so connected and tight just typing away while everything in the world fors on my[roars on by?]... I can keep my head on several different levels at the same time! Do I do this all the time? Do I always hear the music, look at the window, see the lgithing, focus on what I am doign, type and write? This is like a catharsis thing?!! Everything just pooring out. 
102	0	a	I mustn't erase. But that's just a weird 'going home' craving. I've THGOUHT these things, but I can get them on paper(ish) now. This is pretty amazing. And there is NO FEAR that what I took is something besides what I think it is.... CUZ I grew it! I made it! My work my time my effort... this need to share is ammzing... the cat ... where is she... 
103	0	a	(I am aware that I am rambling. I AM aware that things are going VERY VERY fast, and that I'm doing the stream of conciousness thing. Abstract appropriately... I'm aware that I'm aware and so forth.)
104	0	a	I want to share this. Must erase that bit. heh. This will be interesting later. I know what it was, but the rest of you won't. I can't really even tell you that.
105	0	a	I keep typing because this will be so am(saved)azing to read later. But its tiresome to type, but the recordning is just part of this experience... other experiences will be different (ITs getting dark now) Do we always have this much going on in our hgeads... awareness of the windows my feet the time te [the?] my OWN awareness? I wish I could type better than I do so that others who read this will be able to see the thoughts which are, I'm afraid, rather crystal clear at this point.
106	0	a	BUT so effing much! So many levels. Must keep all this under control most of the time! but not right now. Just me and this fucking typewriter. If you'd only seen all the silly images I've been parading And we can't possibly forget the face in the mirror. Mine, but much DIFFERENT!
107	0	a	Can I show this to anyhene? A measure of how close we are I think?

140	0	a	The previous time I had taken mushrooms in a similar setting I had not dealt with the whole thing very well. It had been too overwhelming, too powerful and I had felt inclined to stop myself going mad. I was far too tense, but I had learnt from this. I needed, if I was going to cross the threshold, to let go, to forget my ego, let myself see what was on the other side instead of constantly trying to pull away from it. I find that the setting adds considerably to the content of your trip. I had been to the same place twice before, a 24 hour club that incorporated a play, some dance floors, a vast expanse of chill-out areas (many were shoe-free, alcohol-free and tobacco-free zones, which didn't bother me), a sort kind of street decorated with shop upon shop, which, as the evening progresses, becomes a central focal point to meet people or regroup. The whole thing is set in a mass of tunnels, usually used as car-parks, but which, for one night become another world. It is not so much a club, but more of a plain, a community which exists by the outside world but not with it. Once you are in, it does not feel like anywhere, and yet you are there. For me, it is heaven, a heaven with bad bits and good bits. The tunnels are virtually bear, and the only things that hide the crumbling brick and cement the place is made out of are the psychedelic stalls, painting, decorations, virtual D.J screens, and of course, the people. It all gets a bit complicated, but things will become clearer as the report progresses.
141	0	a	I took the shrooms at 9.30 p.m, leaving about a gram to half a gram, for later. 5 grams is a lot, and I trying to get them all down my gullet as quickly as possible was challenging, so I decided to savour them, to enjoy them more, eat them slowly, and swirl them round my mouth so that I could really taste them. I found this had a good effect later on, since the whole trip seemed a lot more relaxed, less strenuous or stressful (than my last one had been). I rolled up a joint with the pollen, partly to avoid nausea, which I occasionally get with shrooms, and partly too relax me, to prepare me for the ensuing trip. I find that if you go into a trip stressed or anxious, that is the way the trip is going to be. If you go into one relaxed and thoughtful, the trip becomes more enjoyable, and it is easier to take in the sights at a slow pace, ignoring some if you want. In this way, you can help stop everything becoming too much too quickly. 
142	0	a	The pollen was really strong, but not sleep inducing. It made me much more alert, more sensitive to sights and sounds. A haze had appeared around me, and everyone was part of it, breathing it in and out. It was totally benevolent, and I embraced it, taking deep breaths and exhaling very slowly. I suppose it is a form of meditation, and once I had finished I was at peace - completely relaxed. The next joint took me up. It was as if it was working in harmony with the mushrooms, they had become one. I let the flow of energy rise up and envelope me. I did not want to speak, I wanted to look at everything, concentrate on each thing and see what it was, what it was doing. A friend asked me what was happening, impatiently waiting for his 'shrooms to work', but I told him nicely to be quiet. At the beginning of a trip, it is helpful to be silent, and to try and get silence from others. Loud noises directed at you can divert your attention away, and put an annoying barrier between you and you visions, you new thoughts. For the twenty minutes, or however long you deem necessary, try to do this and I promise you it will help. It settles you in gently, allows you to prepare for more intense things to come. In a way, it is your introduction to the being you are going to spend the next 5 - 9 hours with. Be considerate, and observe, and everything will be all right. Once I felt focused enough I left my friends. I lit a cigarette, inhaled, and moved into the next stage. The walls that had once been grubby, uneven surfaces were now a mass of swirling, coiling, snake-like things, which formed beautiful patters. It was as if the bricks had come together to form an intense blue, very viscous liquid. I was afraid to touch it, so I just looked, and was happy just observing. For me, touching things can ruin my focus, but this is not always the case. I would like to be able to feel things, perhaps become one with them for a certain amount of time. I certainly have the ability to do this with other people; through touch you can bond with people in ways that are inexplicable, but beautiful. You can even get close to becoming one entity with them. I walked around for hours, staring, and then I noticed something I hadn't really payed much attention to before. I could talk to people with my mind, I didn't need to speak to them with my voice. Some people did not pay any attention to me, but with those that looked at me right in the eyes I could discuss things. It wasn't in English but we knew what each other meant. Sometimes what was thought had no form or idea, but we knew what was meant by it. You could tell wether or not you would like a person, whether or not they wanted to talk to you. I found myself looking for people to do this with, and once we had introduced ourselves, we resorted to ordinary speech. I would like to develop this further, and it is something I will really concentrate on over the next few weeks. It only really appears with hallucinogens, but it's great. For me, it's proof of psychic existence, and the power of the mind. It needs cultivating, but it could be used to great effect. It was my experiment throughout the trip, and I found that I could communicate in that way much more effectively with friends.
143	0	a	Another thing I noticed was the unity of the whole place, it was as if people's minds were forming a great mass above their heads, filling the whole place. It was a 'combined mind', but like the real brain, it had many different parts. Each person was a separate part, but a section which work with others to produce the overall effect. This is the power of the place, and the reason why the whole experience is so different from anything else: your body is not important there, it's what you are thinking that's vital. The people who come in and don't let their minds and spirits go are the ones who don't enjoy it. If you don't let yourself become part of the experience you cannot enjoy what is happening. You have to let yourself go to understand what is going on. 
144	0	a	On my travels through the 'caverns' I found many people - some were happy to be in my vision, others were not. That is the way things go. You won't connect with everyone, and not everyone will like you, want to bond with you. The best thing to do is not to let it bother you, and in that way you can avoid being upset or freaked-out in many situations. I just ignored, or left those who gave me bad vibes, even when it was difficult not to ask myself why they didn't want to be with me. With so many people in one place, it is impossible to find harmony in everyone. This can be used in the world as a whole. Bond with people you feel you have a connection with, have something to say with, and ignore or tolerate people with whom you don't. It's working for me. I think that each person can learn so much from a trip, if you go into it the right way, and travel through it in the right frame of mind. I have found that you must not take shrooms, or acid, or any psychedelics to escape, but to learn, to discover to explore. Forget how fucked you are, forget the pains and strains of reality, and glide through whatever it is that happens to you. What I found helpful was that whenever I got too worked up, or freaked-out, a joint really calmed me down. Rolling up gives you a focus, and smoking the joint allows you to sink back into yourself, to relax and find what you lost again. I always found a quiet place with some friends, and sat down for a joint. I'm sure many others do this, and would agree with me on this matter. 
145	0	a	After a few hours of taking in the sights, patterns, sounds, smells and people around me, I decided to find somewhere to lie down and explore my own mind. I had to close my eyes for this - when you close your eyes you are officially in your own mind, and what you see is only relevant to you. It is very hard to describe what I saw, but I will try and remember exactly what was there, in my head. An important theme was 'the tunnels'. I was usually travelling forward, but often, I would be distracted by the colorful patterns warping and changing on the walls of the tunnels, and then I would start moving backwards, away from the light that I could see at the end of each one. It took and good deal of focus and determination, but I did get to the end, reached the light, and another vision was exposed to me. Sometimes they were horrible - screaming faces coming out of each other, eyes peering at me, then becoming figures dancing, which would expand out into walls made up of squares positioned in geometric patterns. After each set of visions, there was another tunnel and another struggle to reach the end. It slowly became easier, and eventually I was glided through, very fast, but enough to take in everything. Then everything came to an end, and I think I found my spirit. It was a head, very stiff, very upright, almost African looking. Sometimes it looked at me, other times it didn't, but it was there and it didn't change or shift like the others things I had seen had done. It was a statue, a goal I had reached. I opened my eyes, picked up my notebook, which already had stuff scrawled in it, and began to write again (this was REALLY HARD): here's a view things I wrote, there not very clear, but they might help you to understand how I felt during the trip:
146	0	a	The train, holding onto the rails like they are the only things that exist in this molten, swirling void. Where do I start? I can't even write can't, it's not here, I'm here, are you in or out? Slipping, hold on to it and them - there/there. 'what are you, some sort of ventriloquist?'
147	0	a	I think the train and its rails represents the entity that I grabbed hold of and got through all the tunnels really quickly. The tunnels are perhaps the molten, swirling void (I saw them in that way). I seem to be writing about things from the real world not existing where I was; 'Can't' is a good example. I just could not write it properly - it took numerous attempts to make it legible and to spell it correctly. I was there, but the words were not. I'm not to sure about the rest. The last thing I wrote was a quote from the play; I'm not quite sure what it means, but I'm working on it. After that i started scrawling geometric patterns onto the page. They were quite impressive, considering I'm awful at math. I could not stop, I kept swirling and spinning with the pen. There was a purpose, and after ten or so minutes it appeared: it was my guiding spirit. He appeared amongst the lines, and quickly I followed his outline and any others I could see before he disappeared. He is still there now, with some weird force, or what seems to me to be like life, spewing from his eyes and mouth. I'd like to show you, but I don't have a scanner.
148	0	a	It was there that my visions ended, and I came out of the trip. I carried on smoking the pollen until there was nothing left. I was so happy, so fulfilled. I felt I really had learnt something that evening, or day, or night. The next time will be even better. (N.B. Any concept of time is what I perceived it to be after the event. During my trip, I had no idea of any time passing or going. It is unimportant, irrelevant to the journey. Ten minutes could have been an hour, half an hour, anything. They are only guesses.)

150	0	a	Mushrooms - P. semilanceata (90) : Festival / Lg. Crowd (24), General (1)
151	0	a	Time: Around seven pm till 2 am on 20th of May 1995.
152	0	a	Occasion: Smoking of several grams (4-6 g) of skunk-weed and ingestion of 8 large Psilocybe semilanceatas for recreational purposes.
153	0	a	Setting: This experience took place in my apartment in comfy bed while different very enjoyable ambient was beingplayed. A friend was present also enjoying little relaxatory doses of these substances.
154	0	a	Mind Set: I had not ingested any psychedelic substance since 4.11.95 (about 5 months pause). Have felt good for last weeks, and during previous week studied ethnobotany and anthropology quite intensively. During saturday first slept till 2 pm, and then went to a festival (alone though - was unable to reach any friends, which caused a very slight depression); 'Worlds Meet' - all kinds of people there and lots of different musics/arts/thoughts etc. Nice atmosphere.
155	0	a	After that went to Botanical Gardens of Helsinki University for a long stroll. Very nice, and I felt very peaceful and calm after leaving the gardens. Went home and a friend came at 6 when he said he'd come. We started with a chat and a few small bonghits...
156	0	a	These skunk bonghits were always very subtle but powerful, I felt. One thinks one is very sober and normal, but when trying to do something or even thinking something complex reveals the true nature of things.. Fun, I've always felt.
157	0	a	We smoked couple of small bongfuls of these (maybe 2 grams per head), and then decided to take a little time to listen to FSOL's ISDN and Isaku Sakaros Ohm.. Nice.. Both very nice for this ultralight-paragliding of the conciousness. Both are of very high fidelity with large hall and space-echoes even when sober, and my stereos are also very HiFi, so almost immediately I was swept along into the spaces and places in the music - every detail and overall perception of music was of very hig resolution. I was on the verge of literally tripping - nice visuals.
158	0	a	After about half an hour we drank some mushroom tea. Taste was as icky as it had been 5+ months ago and before that, and all effects felt somehow very familiar. Though quite diluted, in spite of the very long pause. While stoned, the tenseness of the jaws was not felt coming on, and legs felt quite feeble already, so only coming on-effects were introduction of extra reverb into each sound, and very slow deepening of all thoughtpatterns... Visuals also came quite colorful, but the patterns I usually see on the retina (small dots, waves and squares of different color) were absent. Some Thursday Afternoon was being played, and we both decided that it w as bit too lame, as we both listen to it very much while reading and such.. So on came Terry Rileys Shri Camel.
159	0	a	This was probably about 45 minutes after ingestion. I felt very sober, could speak very clearly and still knew I was quite inebriated. My friend put on Flasher to about 15 Hz and white, and I decided to take a dive to the deep...
160	0	a	To some extent all this was spontaneous, and yet I did think every now and then parts of the hallucinations, for instance the tunnels... ... I thought, 'I'll go towards the light, white light,' and these beginnings of caverns were forming in front of my eyes, of blue, and pink and orange color.. I searched for the white light, and found it.. I dove in and the caven changed into tunnel made of turquose rings of light, I sped through them, towards the white light, rings grew quickly paler and suddenly I felt very weird - awed sort of, bit scared if I should do this, or jus t open my eyes - I had lost the feel of my body and was completely away in the spiritworld.. I hesitated for a microsecond and then continued while thinking 'Don't think. Think nothing. Thinki pinki.' [ =) ] - and suddenly was there -
161	0	a	In the _Primordial_Fire_, it burned me away, cleansed me of everything, parts of me beginning to melt and turn into dust blow away by the horrible force of this pure white light - I opened my eyes, as I felt a tingles in my body where the parts had begun melting - everything was back to quite normal. 'Oh, don't fight it,' I thought, 'let go. Let go. LET GO,' I said to myself, and closed eyes, stopped fighting it, the fire returning in the form of a volcano, volcano the size of the Himalayas, I was the volcano. I burned and oozed and was being purified - and this was not an unpleasant feeling, more like bittersweet, and I also felt very powerful... I was unable to completely let go, so this little doubt dwelt in the back of my mind, whether I should stop, for the intensity of everything was rapidly escalating. 
162	0	a	I the volcano turned from pale red to pure white, pressure building up along the temperature, and suddenly I let go. Just relaxed myself physically and mentally, and the volcano erupted into the skies, throught the skies to the space, towards all stars in the form of quark-sized million-kelvin particles. 
163	0	a	My friend asked me whether I wanted to have a few hits off the bong.. I took some, and changed Riley to something else (can't remember). And then I lay down again, saying I'll take another dive. As I closed my eyes for a short time my thoughts and visions were very chaotic, but then I saw a woman. I don't know exactly what she looked like, and so on, but I stepped closer to her thinking I would began to have these visions of wild orgies I've sometimes had - in the Psychedelic Experience it is mentioned as some bardo of some level.. But no.
164	0	a	She was Mother Earth. For a moment I was bewildered. Then I placed my hand on her vaginal lips, and first one, then two fingers slipped in.. Then my hand, and my arm.. And all the time I grew smaller, or she grew bigger, for I went inside her womb, which was a passageway.. I felt very warm.. very secure and she showed me things I had done wrong, things I should do... Very quickly after this the visions began to fade, totaling in about 3 hours.. My friend had taken a couple more shrms and he came out of it about half an hour later.. So we listened to weird and wonderful ambient-music and smoked and talked about what we had experienced... 
165	0	a	What was very weird is that we smoked at least 3 grams of nice weed during these hours between 11 pm and 2 am, and either didn't feel very stoned. Maybe the rest of the bag was not as good as the top, or then our tolerance (psychological) had increased after the voyage.
166	0	a	Summary (sort of): Very nice experience of much greater strength than I had expected, even after 5 months pause. However I was quite in control, being able to return to normal levels of conciousness by opening my eyes. The effects of the setting, I feel, were very pro- nounced (primordial fire, purification, symbolic death and mother earth are all elements of shamanic traditions). I liked very much the softening effects of the marijuana on the phase where ef- fects are coming on. But had I ingested larger dose (eg. 40 mushrooms), the result wouldn't probably had been as nice. Even though the preparation period was very short (couple of hours in the Botanical Gardens) experience was quite divine. So I arrive to this conclusion: The Divinity or Quality is not connected to the Dosage. More is not necessarily Better.

168	0	a	Mushrooms - P. semilanceata (90) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Mystical Experiences (9), General (1)
169	0	a	A friend of mine gave me an eighth of an ounce for my birthday. After doing a lot of homework on advice (set and setting, etc.) I decided to split them with someone I trusted. This was my first time and, so far, my only shroom experience.
170	0	a	I did not experience anything unusual within the first hour or so, possibly even two hours. What I did notice (upon analyzing the events later on) was a slowly rising giddyness and an inability to hold a train of thought for very long. During the course of the walk from where my friend and I took them to my apartment I would forget a line of thought then it would bubble up maybe five, ten minutes later. The giddyness felt something like being drunk, only with hyper overtones.
171	0	a	The whole night I did not experience any visuals beyond some meager trails. But the mental aspect was...illuminating. Over the course of the next few hours I was to go through a seemingly unrelated series of emotional states, such as extreme confidence, paranoia, bewilderment (did I mention paranoia? more on that later). I ran into the friend who had given me the shrooms that night, after I'd parted ways with my shroom partner. (Newbies: it is not recommended to separate from your partner(s) at any time during the experience).
172	0	a	My provider expected me to be having vivid hallucinations and to be unable to separate hallucination from reality. Instead, my mind felt like it was in some kind of uncontrollable turbo mode. I found myself pacing around at one point. I think the calmest moments I had during the peak was, perhaps pathetically, while listening to Jimi Hendrix. You think that stuff is good when you're sober? It spoke to my soul in those moments. Then my provider distracted me and wanted me to see something cool. Another note: when somebody's trippin', just let them do whatever, as long as they're not endangering themselves or others, of course. It tends to disturb and already teetering emotional control and will make them extremely agitated.
173	0	a	I could have sat there for hours, just drinking up Jimi's riffs, with a stupid smile wide enough to make my ears fall off. Well, he (my provider) had to go to sleep. It was late for him, so I moved on. During the walk from his location to mine, I got that classic feeling that people were looking at me. Not like they thought I was high, however. It was like I felt for the first time I saw, all around, people looking at me when they thought I didn't see them looking. Who knows what that was all about. It got to the point where I felt I was altering events just by my presence, like I was a mote, determining possibilities, and people whirled around me and did things they would not have done had I not been around.
174	0	a	I went to see some friends for a few minutes, to see what was up. I felt uncomfortably aware of their personae. I felt as though I could divine their thoughts from their facial expressions during a discussion, in those moments when they were not talking or waiting to talk, merely watching the conversation themselves. Well, I felt really obvious and eventually ended up back at my apartment, alone. This is where the paranoia really took hold. In retrospect, I believe what I was doing was resisting the fading away of identity. Don't get me wrong; I still knew who I was, but only on an intellectual level. After about ten minutes of struggling here, I lay down and purposefully blocked out all thoughts. I replaced those thoughts with music I just created in my head (I did music in primary school and all of secondary school). It's not a hard thing to conjure music under those conditions. I just let Jimi take over for a while, turning up the mental volume whenever the heebie-jeebies got too close up. Then I expierenced something magical. I told myself to 'Just be.'
175	0	a	For the next hour or so, as I drifted off to sleep, Jimi's extended jam faded away to be replaced by--silence. No thought. No emotions. Just calm. Relaxation. I let my mind drift naturally after a while, and I got some of the most unusual aural sensations I've ever experienced. Imagine your brain as being equipped with full-surround sound. I heard sounds I didn't expect or force. Rumbling and revving motorcycle engines scooting off from my left and into the distance. Snatches of conversation like a television turned up loud, then quiet.
176	0	a	Gradually, these sounds seemed to fill in a picture that eerily matched the conditions outdoors. This was a late saturday night in a college town; people still walking around, milling, conversing. I saw those streets, as if I was walking into a dream. And with the escalating rapidity of water going down the drain, things became more vivid, more vivid, more vivid, then--pop! The sensations had become so real that I had got mentally jarred and came out of it.
177	0	a	To this day I don't what to make of that event. I'd always had a hopeful curiousity about out-of-body experiences, perhaps this was merely some psychological manifestation of Freudian wish fulfillment. Or maybe it was actually my spirit floating around there. That would have been truly awesome, however unprovable, and I would take shrooms again in the hopes that I could recreate that experience.
178	0	a	So, the brief version: giddyness evolving into a whirl of mental activity, no audiovisual hallucinations, some paranoia. Oh, and I had a little talk with myself, speaking alone to myself in the third person. That was unsettling. But no lasting side-effects. I felt fine the next morning.
179	0	a	Oh, one more thing before I go to bed: I had a lot of grand notions about levels of being and existence; I envisioned interesting physical models to represent the levels, and where humans fit in. I was absolutely sure of our place in the midst of a multi-planar Universe full of all different kinds of sentient creatures both bodily and ethereal. That chiseled-in-stone conviction was nothing more than a bemusing notion the next day. My interpretation: don't let sudden 'revelations' about the Universe allow you to do things in public that you wouldn't usually do. I didn't do anything stupid, but I saw how easy it was to go flying off the handle, so to speak.

181	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
182	0	a	I had done mushrooms on about 8 different occasions prior to this particular experience. We had just purchased about 2 ounces of mushrooms, and decided we'd eat them later the next night. Well, the next night I ended up buying some more and eating about 2 grams before we even broke into the 2 ounces. After about an hour after eating the first mushrooms I began to feel extremly light headed, and in a euphoric state. So I decided to take some knife hits of high grade cannibis, and to eat some more mushrooms.
183	0	a	The colors at first, were facinating! I had never seen such tracers and patterns before, and was amazed by the bright and detailed color. They seemed so real! But, out of nowhere, the colors dissapeared, and I suddenly felt alone and confused. I could not figure out what was going on. I got scared, and decided I should go home and sleep it off.
184	0	a	After finally finding a ride home, I started to feel a bit better. But as soon as I walked in the house I began to feel scared again. The patterns started to appear again. But now the patterns where consumed in everything I looked at. I was stuck in patterns. My thoughts slowly began to race, I was now unable to concentrate on any single thought. My heart began to race, I felt my soul was being ripped from my body. I thought I was dying, and tried lying down to relax my body, as my mind was telling me, I was preparing my soul for death. Not my body, but my soul. 
185	0	a	I started to feel better, and felt as though I were slowly falling asleep, but all of a sudden I felt a jolt in my body. My ears began to ring. The most violent sound I have ever yet to hear. And in front of me appeared a solid gas sphere of bright colors, with extensions which grew from all sides of the sphere of colors. The sphere disapeared and my room began to sink in. It felt like my room was actually brathing, and I was stuck inside. Everthing I looked at began to shift shape and warp. I was now unable to concieve what was real and what was not. As things were warping, I felt this was the end, I thought I was going to have to kill myself to end it all. 
186	0	a	As soon as the warping ended, I felt a urge to get up and leave the house. I jumped out of bed, sweating, and frantic, grabbed my shirt and began to put it on, only to throw it across the room. I don't know why I did, it kinda felt like the shirt was trying to grow onto me. I felt confused, began to put my pants on, but my hand braced up on some gum which mysteriously got stuck on me, I began to pull it off, unaware that it was gum, and thought I was pulling my skin off. I panicked. My body was deteriorating due to the poisons which I felt were slowly killing me. Once I realising it was just gum, reality began to slowly come back to me. I was begining to finally relize it was just a trip and would soon pass. Over the next 6 hours I experienced flashes off the mushrooms kicking in, but a little less powerful each time, until I finally fell alseep.
187	0	a	For about the next 4-5 months, I experiend random flashbacks, and anxiety attacks. I have eat mushrooms since the experience, but I was alot more careful with my dosage. I have also done acid on different occainsions, but have had pleasruable experieneces every time.
188	0	a	I feel like I made some confrotations with my fears. And feel like I actually got a positive experience out of this. And would one day like to take more, to experinece an even further journey of the mind.

190	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : Various (28), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
191	0	a	My family owns a cottage in the muskoka lakes area; it is a modest house on an absolutely breathtaking lake surrounded by coniferous woods. My family usually goes up there around august, but this summer i decided to venture earlier and meet some friends at their cottage just across the lake. I brought up the essentials for my partying: liquor, pot and fungus (about 10 grams in case anyone else wanted them). But to my surprise, my friends were not at their cottage and i was forced to spend 2 nights alone. The first night i rented a movie and had a couple drinks with it, followed by some good, old-fashioned sleeping in. 
192	0	a	The next evening was an experience i'll never forget. The day started off simple enough, with a hot cup of coffee and a cigarette. I then went to see if my friends were home yet, and with luck, i had caught them as they were packing up to go back to the city for another week. However they purchased most of my mushrooms from me, leaving me with about 4 grams for myself. I decided that night was when they would be consumed. Besides, i hadn't had a spiritual experience for a while, so why not?
193	0	a	    I went to town and rented another movie, and at about 7 o clock i began watching. As the previews rolled by, i noticed the lack of anything else to eat with my shrooms. All i had left was pop. So i took a piece of paper, folded it in half the long way, and poured the dust in the fold. I funneled all the dust into my mouth as i tipped my head back and took a swig of my coke. The combo fizzed unexpectedly, overflowing in my mouth and spilling approx. a gram of fungi. I reluctantly swallowed the remaining mix, and grimaced from the bittersweet taste. I continued watching my movie and didn't notice any differences until the ending, when forrest gump's face began to ebb and flow in tiny ripples. I looked around the living room, at the setting sun, and felt a visual equivalent of sexual arousal, i wanted to intensely observe my surroundings all i could.
194	0	a	It went like that for about 2 hours, me sitting in the living room, taking in my surroundings and sensing so many things at once that i felt i had to get out; although i was the only one in the house, i felt i had to get out. My sudden claustrophobia caused me to jump out of my recliner and to the screen door, i rushed out the door as if not getting away from something anymore, but magnetized toward something. I felt myself walk along the lakeside not exactly sure of where i was going, but positive that i was going somewhere. My instinct told me just to keep walking.
195	0	a	It felt like about a half hour that i trod the shoreline, my eyes fixed on the water still as glass. I contemplated whether or not it would be possible for me to walk on the glassy surface, or to iceskate in the middle of summer. 
196	0	a	My eyes strayed straight ahead as i realized i was at a resort on the same lake as my cottage. My purpose became dreadfully clear: i was to find myself near here. I kept tracing the shoreline until i came to the clearing that was the golf course. It was truly a magnificent sight to behold; i saw a perfectly trimmed grass clearing, with the crystal clear lake to one side, with the moon reflecting softly off the water. On the other side of the clearing was the dark, menacing woods,casting shadows and concealing evil, no doubt. I felt frightened by the woods, but reassured myself by refixing my eyes on the water. 
197	0	a	And so i walked on, coming to the center of the golf course and noticing in the moonlight a white object placed in the middle of the course. I walked closer until i could make it out, then stopped in bewilderment. It was a muskoka chair (adirondack chair for you yankees) placed, oddly enough, in the middle of the goddamn golf course. What purpose would it serve? I suddenly realized it was there for me. I was to find myself in this chair. 
198	0	a	Slowly i lowered myself into the chair, it was covered in dew and faced toward the lake. I took this as a metaphor for how i should live. I should begin looking at the good(lake) and stop my pessimism by turning my back to the bad(woods).
199	0	a	As i looked out into the water, i began thinking about myself and how i had been living my life lately. My career had come secondary to socializing and i had neglected my family for the past year. I could see myself in the lake as if it had turned from glass into a mirror, showing me what i was doing in my life and how to change it. I came to the divine realization that only hard work and optimism could make me into the kind of person i wanted to be. I sat in the chair until sunrise, when i promptly marched back home and got some much-needed sleep. I had beats pounding through my head at 4 a.m. and they had since died away. 
200	0	a	My life has drastically been changed by this experience and i haven't done mushrooms since. My hard work and optimism have paid off in a recent relationship and a promotion at my job. I feel refreshed every day i wake up and i have those 3 grams of mushrooms to thank for it. They opened my eyes to what's really going on in my life.

203	0	a	I am going to do my best to describe my experience from last night. Some of it is still hard for me to comprehend.
204	0	a	I have tripped on mushrooms 4 or 5 times prior to this. None of those experiences have been very spiritual or mystical in any way other then interesting visuals and a strong body high. I have also taken salvia twice, and the first time I ever tripped on salvia I had an extremely moving and disturbing experience where I felt as though my reality was crashing down around me. I literally went from being in my friendÂs apartment to being in a small suburban town where children were telling me that my life wasnÂt real.
205	0	a	Anyway I wasnÂt expecting a spiritual experience from the mushrooms I was expecting fun lights, colors and sounds. I wasnÂt expecting a spiritual experience from the mushrooms I was expecting fun lights, colors and sounds. My friend and I ate our mushrooms around 9pm. He had a bit more then me because I couldnÂt stomach the taste of my peanut butter and mushroom sandwich.  We also smoked a bowl of weed. 
206	0	a	The night started out normal, interesting textures that looked like they were constantly moving, music was moving these colors.  About 3 hours into the trip I look over and realize that my friend was goo-ing and gah-ing like a baby and I realize we were in like a babyÂs room of some sort. I was on Pandora trying to play Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd that my friend kept requesting and requesting only all I could see was my computer seeing, ÂNo, thatÂs not what I wantÂ. Which I interpreted as the computer telling me that I didnÂt want to be comfortably numb.
207	0	a	ThatÂs when I snapped too and told my friend I needed to go to bed, I couldnÂt stay around him anymore. He is a good friend of mine but I was seeing him for Âwho he really wasÂ which wasnÂt really positive. Then my body was trying to explain to me that he was coming into my life and I was seeing it from the outside. Like I was watching a movie of me and my life only very abstract. (This whole time we were sitting on my porch)
208	0	a	I then walked through my house and up to my bedroom. As I was passing my living room Planet Earth was on. They were discussing the whale and the parenting habits of the this particular whale which I interpreted as going from the babyÂs room of childhood to being an adult woman physically ready to bear children. My house had now become me and my body.
209	0	a	When I went to my bed I tried to sleep but couldnÂt. Everything in my body was tense and thatÂs when I started to see God. 
210	0	a	How can I explain the next couple of hours? I started thinking about certain people in my life and my connection with them. How we all are linked together but certain people you feel stronger connections with. I have never been one to believe in soul mates or fate but suddenly I knew who my soul mate was and that it was ÂfateÂ or a pull to this person. 
211	0	a	The most important feeling that was pulling at me last night was the urge to tell people. The most important feeling that was pulling at me last night was the urge to tell people. It suddenly became important for me to spread this information to people. I suddenly knew that the Earth was God and that I was God. I could control anything and everything and I could do anything I wanted. I saw myself for who I was: a fighter, I fight against everything, I want power above all (not to control others but to control myself), and I wanted to see. It is hard for me to describe how powerful all of this was, I couldnÂt ignore it even if I wanted to. 
212	0	a	There was a time when I thought I was dying or already dead. Almost convinced. Not because my body had stopped working but because my mind was expanding. Next thing I know I am waking up to my phone ringing.

214	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
215	0	a	After not being able to find mushrooms near my house for a few years, I hit the jackpot this fall. I came across a pond not far from my house where hundreds of psilocybe mushrooms were growing in the manure around the bank. I believe the species is Cubensis. I tried eating a few with two friends, and based on our experience I believe the mushrooms are weak, though another guy tried 3 of them and he thought they were strong. I believe the mushrooms are weak, though another guy tried 3 of them and he thought they were strong. 
216	0	a	While planning to spend a few days with my girlfriend at her place I decided to make some mushroom tea and take it with me. I used exactly one hundred mushrooms of various sizes. By this time the mushrooms had been dried for month or so. I boiled 4 cups of water then added the 100 mushrooms and 2 Lipton tea bags. I stirred it up and let it sit in the fridge over night. The next day I stirred again then strained the liquid off. I added a little water so I once again had 4 cups. I added sugar to taste as I drank the tea.
217	0	a	I started sipping on the tea around 7:30. My girlfriend K did not drink any tea, she was drinking whiskey I think. I didnt know how strong it would be so I wasnt planning to drink any particular amount. In 15 or 20 minutes I started feeling it. When I eat mushrooms I go through a rough phase before I start to feeling good, but with tea the rough phase is mild and short, and that was the case that night. The most intense part of the high came early on: I lay down on the bed and when I would closed my eyes I'd see eyes and Aztec designs that made up a rolling, indigo landscape. Then I would have the feeling that I was melting into that landscape, becoming part of it.
218	0	a	K walked to the Waffle House next door. I didnt feel up to being in public, but as I lay there I started thinking about her and us, and my feeling changed very quickly. Suddenly I wanted to be near her, and going outside sounded nice. Outside I was seeing a lot of starburst which made the street lights very pretty. I ran into a guy who's living upstairs from K, and he started talking to me. I'm pretty sure he is schizophrenic. K had already told me about him and what a religious weirdo he is. He said K was totally crazy about me, which I was glad to hear, and I told him I'm pretty crazy about her. He told me the Devil loves him and asked me if I know the Devil. We had an ...interesting little talk. We probably talked five minutes and it seemed like he didnt blink his eyes once the whole time, haha. Then K was coming back with the food and I went inside with her.
219	0	a	I dont remember much about the next few hours. I remember cuddling a lot with K, and I remember realizing I was falling in love with her, and thinking about what a fantastic turn my life was taking. I felt very good. I wasnt horny at all, which was unfortunate for K because she was. Mushrooms usually take all my sex drive away. Mushrooms usually take all my sex drive away. Once I looked up at the ceiling and saw shapes and figures there as the texture seemed to move around. I went to bed around 4 or 5 in the morning. That night I drank between one-half and two-thirds of the tea.
220	0	a	I had been planning on taking the rest of the tea home and freezing it for future use, but two nights later K wanted me to drink more of it, so I decided I'd drink the rest. After just two days I didnt expect the tea to do much for me. My past experience indicates it takes me about 4 days to return to normal mushroom tolerance. But I decided to drink the rest and see what it did for me.
221	0	a	In a short time I felt very hyper and zonked out. For two or two and a half hours I felt kind of bad. I decided this was going to be one of those times when I wouldnt ever get past the rough phase and would not feel good (usually the rough phase lasts about 30 minutes), but then I suddenly started feeling good. After eating a little bit of seafood and smoking a cig I felt very good. The first night I did not shake the tea jar up, and I wonder if maybe some potent mushroom matter settled to the bottom, because that second night I got higher than I expected to. I drank the rest of the tea, but that was at most half of what I originally had, probably less than half.
222	0	a	K had a bad headache because of her menses and a friend wrote her that Sprite and Advil might help, so I decided to walk to the nearest gas-station to get Sprite. She didnt want me to go but I insisted. Besides I really wanted to get out in the night air. Again I had starburst which made the night lights lovely. I made it to the gas-station and back without incident.
223	0	a	After taking the Advil and Sprite K soon got to feeling much better. I put on the movie La Noche de Walpurgis and we started fooling around. Unlike the first night, I got pretty horny this night. Unlike the first night, I got pretty horny this night. Because of her menses she refused to take her pants off, but I think this actually made it better. It was so erotic. I'm going to try that style of love making again.
224	0	a	After that I sat on the bed, leaning back against the headboard, holding K. At first I was kind of watching tv but then I forgot about the tv. I was feeling very good, thinking about my family and friends, and K and the dog were snuggling up against me. I closed my eyes, felt at one with K, and meditated effortlessly. It was one of the most content times of my life. I simply felt good; I was calm but not tired. Again I had feelings of love toward K, the feeling that I am falling in love with her. I still feel that way now, three days later. Eventually I got tired, brushed my teeth, and went to bed.

227	0	a	For a while, me and my best friend have been growin our own shrooms. It is december but still we wanted to trip. We took the day off and turned our fones off. We measured out 2 grammes each and went to a local botanical garden. 
228	0	a	We began early, it felt like a special occasion. We gulped down the shrooms with some snapple then sat on a bench by a lake, surrounded by geese. We have liftoff. 
229	0	a	The tingling began in my fingers, then an emptiness arose in my stomach. The grass began to breathe and the water developed fuzzy patterns. We werent in kansas no more. We got up and kept moving.
230	0	a	Soon the colour was very intense. We were stumbling around like two drunk fools and to be honest, I was getting a bit scared. I was trying to control the trip which is a huge mistake. Somehow we ended up at a kind of chinese temple garden. There was an expanse of white gravel which we stared into. It hummed with nothingness and gave me a similar feeling to when I'm looking at fire or into the ocean. It was nothingness though, and it hummed. We stared and vibrated silently with it- were at one with it. From this point on the trip became revelatory.
231	0	a	Next thing I knew I had tracers: when I moved my hand around it left visual trails. It was fun and we were jumping around waving our hands around like fools shouting out 'I'm so fucked' it was about then I noticed that a very real policeman was following us very closely from behind. 
232	0	a	I could have panicked but my friend calmed me. We stopped to look at a tree, remarking how beautiful the foliage was and how delightful it would be to sketch. Thinking us to be a couple of young crazy artists and not the druggy lunatics we are, he passed by. 
233	0	a	Soon a new phase of the trip began. We could actually talk again and the most amazing realisation came to us. The main points were that people are sad and unhappy because they are so caught up in their petty problems and trying to outdo everyone else. The point to life is to give, unconditionally, and increase the overall good. One never has to be afraid, ever, because death is all around us and it's not bad or evil. If one thinks of oneself as ships on a vast ocean. The ocean is universal energy and life. When we die all that occurs is that the ship fills with the water, the universal life, and we are absorbed into it. In dying we are transferred into the universal sea of energy. This one realisation has removed my fear of death almost entirely. 
234	0	a	Take faith in the goodness of people, go create things, give to others altruistically and dont get caught up in the silly details of existence. Fashion and bank statements just do not matter. Shrooms have given me a glimpse into that vast, pulsing energy that we are all a part of. We are all just vessels, channeling it. I'm so glad for this realisation. 
235	0	a	Peace, love and understanding. (it may sound trite but *think* about it) and if ur stuck in a hi-paying , soul destroying job...quit! Go and paint a picture or sing a song! Make something from your heart. Go on, give in to the love. You know you want to. :)

237	0	a	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : General (1), Mystical Experiences (9), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Public Space (Museum, Park, etc) (53)
238	0	a	This is an account of the second time that I have taken mushrooms.  I dosed on a complete whim one sunday evening after deciding that it would be amazing to go on a bike ride while the sun was setting.  So I swallowed them all down with some vitamin C and grapefruit juice then proceeded to smoke a bowl.  About an hour later I was feeling the first effects of the shrooms.  I was having trouble seeing clearly and I felt very removed from my surroundings.  At about this time I spotted something very odd.  Ahead of me I saw a cirle of large mushrooms growing near the road.  I rode up to them and stopped in the middle, unable to believe my eyes and unsure whether or not I was hallucinating them (actually the next day I rode by them again and they were real even if not as cool as they had looked before).  I decided that if I just stood where I was looking at the mushrooms I would draw unwanted attention so I quickly continued on my way which was lucky because a few moments later a policeman drove by me.  
239	0	a	At this point I was becoming very spacy and confused.
240	0	a	For one thing, the last time that I had taken them (1/16th ounce of broken, dried cyanescens) I had not tripped but only become very confused, excited, and seen some boring patterns.  This time I could tell it was different, every few seconds I would have to shake my head to bring myself back in to the real world. I became very disconcerted every time I was passed by a car and felt that I was hearing the noise for an unusually long time before they arrived.  I called my friend to see if I still sounded coherent enough to confront my parents when I arrived home.  He had no idea that I was tripping until I told him after a lengthy conversation.  This gave me heart and I made it home without much more incedence.  
241	0	a	When I arrived home I was feeling a distinctly unpleasant body high but was still in near complete possesion of my faculties.  I decided  that I had to take a shower and (for some stupid reason) do my homework.  This pretty much ruined the trip for me so that when I peaked I was trapped in an obsessive, extremely introspective, agitated, and repetitive state.  I desperately wanted to talk to someone and I was feeling very physically ill so I told my sister what I had done and told her to tell my parents if I passed out.  I spent the next several hours trying to do my homework but repeatedly mis-spelled 'recommendation' and for some reason I decided that this meant I had to start the whole thing over.  Also, the entire time I was questioning the merits of my drug use in my head.  There is really nothing like telling yourself you're a DEA statistic over and over again to boost your self esteem.  
242	0	a	I was just over the peak when my dad told us that it was dinner time. I went downstairs hoping that my parents wouldn't notice my extremely dilated pupils.  I managed somehow, though still tripping, to converse normally with my parents while pretending to read the newspaper.   I actually spent the next hour talking to my parents, for some reason it was comfortable at the time.  Soon the effects were gone.  Before I went to sleep I smoked another bowl which brought the effects back to some degree and was rather unpleasant.  
243	0	a	The next day I felt very foggy and burnt out until the afternoon and after that I felt better.  I am very confused why I tripped this time and not before.  Maybe I just have a tolerance to psilocybin and needed the higher dose... Who knows?

245	0	a	Mushrooms - P. cyanescens (67) : General (1), Bad Trips (6), Alone (16)
246	0	a	I started growing Cubensis  4 years ago, used shrooms for one and a half years then stopped for around the same time period. I had a couple of 6 gram trips during that period and they were intense, two were fantastic, the last I went to hell. That was not fun at all, since then been a bit nervous in using high doses.
247	0	a	An acquaintance of mine asked me to grow him some mushrooms a little less then a year ago, I was surprised to find out that one gram is all that he uses, sometimes less like a half gram, he has commented on the strength of my shrooms, I have recently used as little as half a gram and it has quite some effect, however I need at least two grams for decent visuals.
248	0	a	But something strange happened the other night, I ate two grams dry of Ban Hua Thai and another one gram about half an hour later, I find these quite potent but however they did not seem to be having the desired effect on me. I had supper, then decided to have more shrooms because I thought I was not really tripping but I was, I then proceeded to eat two grams cambodian. This time though I sank into serious thought and then snapping back again to what my eyes were seeing and my ears hearing. But as I often drifted off in strange thoughts and perception I started eating more and more of my mushroom,. I then devoured 5 grams of Dutch King, another two grams of cambodian, and then chowed down +- 18 grams of A-strain, this was weird though, when I got into the 18 gs of A-strain, I was stuffing my mouth full and chewing and enjoying the taste so much, I usually want to gag while chewing  shrooms! All the mushroom I ate was cracker dry, from the first mushroom I ate to the last was over a period of 4 hours. 
249	0	a	I did have some concern for a while though, I know that mushroom is hard on the body, my previous six gram trips I found to be rough on the guts and muscles, especially  my last 2g-2g-2g trip over 2 hours a few months back was a bit hard on my body, my muscles everywhere felt like they wanted to spasm but the trip itself was very good. (However I had been exercising intensely during those months and using testosterone at the time.) So I worried about what will happen to me this time. Other then feeling the gut churn after consumption of the first three grams. I then ate a full supper and then afterwards consumed the rest of the shrooms, the trip came on so hard yet it was fairly smooth on the body and no problems with muscle spasms. This may be due to some factors, 1: I had supper early in the trip (usually I cant eat) , 2:the trip came on so hard and fast I had no time to even consider my body, 3, I was on a very low testosterone dosage this time.
250	0	a	Believe it or not but I think the mushroom deceived me into eating the  +- 30 grams dry. I think the mushroom deceived me into eating the  +- 30 grams dry. 
251	0	a	I started to trip super hard, many times more then I have ever been on anything, light was separating into its various colors, extremely vivid colors, more then I have ever experienced, absolutely everything came alive, the floor was teeming with insects and what looked like pieces of food moving around. Flying bright lights about the size of bumble bees, dozens of them started to swirl and fly  around me, my walls flexed intensely with bricks flicking around and every  second or two something large would rapidly swim along the wall, this also happened  on the floor, people on the TV were breaking apart into little blocks and this happened to a number of object. Streaks of colored lights were flying around the room whilst the small ones were still all around me. I had Metal music playing and the vocals would all of a sudden and often become a strange but cool sounding instrument only playing notes, it was kind of freaky, whilst the whole song would suddenly become weirdly distorted. I looked at my arms and my skin appeared to look like lava, with dark and very bright spots of yellow, red white while being semi see through, I thought I saw my muscle underneath.
252	0	a	At this time I realized just how goofed I really was, I went to the bathroom for number one but found it extremely hard to urinate because there was so much going on I could not concentrate, the flying lights held my attention among everything else. Looked in the mirror and my pupils were massive, like gaping holes, my eyes have never dilated on shrooms before. 
253	0	a	Coming back to my lounge I was wobbling like a drunk person, the trip intensified and I rapidly began to lose myself in a new reality, started to slip back and forth between the intense visuals I was experiencing to short mind journeys like intensely vivid dreams, next thing I remember I feel ill and start barfing but purged barely anything, and then that was that, my trip went off the chart, I experienced multiple other realities each one lasting I think for only seconds, maybe minutes, when I returned from the 'dream' or 'journey', I knew that I was in my lounge  and each time I returned the perception I had was different, this was extremely strange yet enjoyable as the euphoria I felt was off the chart too, I couldn't distinguish between reality  and the visions or dreams I was having, occasionally I would come out of my journey from 'who the hell knows where' and  back to my lounge  and I would every time find myself at one of three locations but with different perceptions and this would absolutely mind f**k me every time, I could try to explain some of the dreams but thats pointless. The only words I can use to explain the experience is as 'astonishing, excellent and bizarre'.
254	0	a	I don't really know just how much I remember or forgot but all I know is that this was the most insane and at the same time a fantastic experience. I would love to experience such an intense trip again but I dunno, it feels like I came near to forgetting reality.

256	0	a	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : Alone (16), General (1)
257	0	a	This is the story of one of the craziest if not the craziest night of my fuckin life.
258	0	a	It all started really good, it was me and three other people, IÂm not going to say there names so il call them Akmed, Lucifer and mcmerfy.That night we all decided to take sum fungus and have a good time but what started out incredibly good just in a mater of seconds went terribly wrong. Me and Akmed took about 2.6 grams and Mcmurfy took 1/2 and 8th and Lucifer took a whole 8th and I almost completely lost track of time so thatÂs not that important in this story.We dosed at midnight.
259	0	a	We first decided to play sum old school n64 Mario cart until the effects came on so we played that for about a half hour until every 1 was feeling really 'differentÂ. After that we decided to go out on my screened in porch to chill. So we were just chillin and starting to trip pretty good when the first really random thing happened right out of the middle of nowhere, I was talking to Akmed about something random when all of the sudden I saw a black shape form right next to Akmed. I reached out to touch it and found it to be my German Shepard dog Otto which is really unusual because he is suppose to be chained up in my yard but instead he sum how unclipped himself and decided to chill with us which was all good anyway cause he's the nicest dog youÂd ever meet.
260	0	a	Not long after that we decided to go out in my yard to wonder around (and I was also carrying my bong with me the whole time in its case). I also felt a very strong love for my bong and treated it like a baby and a pillow the whole time. And at this point every 1 has the 'giggles' and is laughing about everything and anything. So were in my yard and were just having fun throwing a neon green inner tube at each other like a Frisbee that we just randomly found in my yard then we all just sort of ended up on the ground looking at the sky.
261	0	a	Note that tonight was a perfect night, perfect temperature perfect breeze that seemed to come as soon as I wanted it to and an almost full moon and a mostly clear sky. Then Lucifer says something like 'now I know what its like to think like a crazy person and to be insane. Man this is fuckin CrAAAzy.'Then he wonders off by himself and comes back with a perfectly rolled blunt so we toke that up except for Akmed who canÂt smoke because of reasons. Then Lucifer starts acting really weird and gets up and starts wondering and running around my front yard. After I think a few minutes I decide IÂm going to see how he's doing cause the rest of us are just chillin on the ground and he is just rambling about weird and freaky shit and acting like a complete crazy person in my yard. This is when things start to go down hill.
262	0	a	As I approach him I hear him mumbling things like 'god danmit stop stop it danmit just fucking stop it god I fuckin hate it I hate it no' then I come up to him and as calm as he can say it he says 'whatÂs up manÂ, and note that as IÂm looking at him that I can see the darkness flowing from him as if I can see him having a hard time and I could literally see his bad trip. I just ask calmly how he's feeling and whatÂs up and he replies that he feels the craziest heÂs ever been then walks a few steps, stops, sits down, stands up,sits down then rolls on the ground then gets back up so I just put my hand on his back and tell him to calm down and just sit down. Then I canÂt remember what exactly happened next but we decided to go back to Akmed and Mcmurphy (who are going out by the way) who are still just chillin. Then Lucifer says he has to walk around more now so me Lucifer and Akmed just go for a lil jog while Mcmerfy chills in my yard.
263	0	a	We didnÂt go far when Akmed starts having a really hard time breathing (he is smoking a cigarette) when he says that every time he breaths its nothing but smoke then he collapses. At this point I donÂt even know what happened to Lucifer and IÂm just with Akmed on the ground trying to figure out whatÂs wrong when he says 'FUCK I'm HAVING A FUCKING BAD TRIP FUCK'.This whole time Mcmurfy is just watching like what the fuck and IÂm just trying to comfort Akmed by telling him that heÂs gona be alright and thatÂs its gona be just fine. Then he starts begging me to take him to the hospital and wake up my parents and shit and IÂm just like 'IÂm sorry man but I just cant do that, its all in your head man, u gota get a hold of your self, I took the same amount you did and your bigger than me and you just gota convince your mind that you have control over this shit like me and you just gota have your mind over it man!' And the whole time IÂm there with him its like I stepped into his mind and was witnessing what he was seeing and going through, almost as if I stepped into his trip. And he is about to cry and is begging me to get my parents. So then I just break it to him straight and tell him that IÂm not going to do that and that its all in his mind and that he is just having a bad trip.Then I tell him that he just has to get it into his mind that he isn't gona let a mushroom fuck with him and he has to literaly put his mind over matter. And me and him both know what caused this to happen, one cigarette and because of this he quit smoking.This whole time my dog is scared shitless and is really worryed, I could tell just by looking at him. And then I remembered my last trip when I did an 8th and remembered how just my house cat put me in a really good mood and decided that maybe an animal's presence could cheer him up, but it was no good.
264	0	a	 And note that I am tripping balls right now.So then I go look for Lucifer in my house while they wait outside. So I go up to my room and find him just pacing around telling me that heÂs just gona try to go to sleep so he lays on my floor and tries to pass out, I donÂt think he ever does. Then Akmed and Mcmurfy come in and Akmed just lies down on my bed and Mcmurfy sits on my couch. At this time itÂs only like, 2 something in the AM and we took our stuff at 12 and there are no lights on and no music. And during this whole trip IÂm trying my hardest not to let my trip go totally down hill which it almost did like the others. So now its just me and Mcmurphy chillin on my couch in the dark with no music which is starting to drive me crazy cause I cant go without music for long so I put in sum Pink Floyd but because of Akmed and Lucifer I had to keep it on really low cause they were just trying to go to sleep. So now IÂm just like what the fuck I got rules now agents me in my own fuckin room so WHAT THE FUCK!!
265	0	a	Then I decide I gota go wonder around my house because IÂm wide awake like Mcmurphy who is surprisingly in control of herself for this being her first trip and just witnessing two total break downs from partialy expierenced shroomers. But as I try to leave to go smoke a bong of headys Akmed says that heÂs sorry and he doesnÂt want me to go because he feels good that IÂm there with him so I decide that I have to be there for him and stay. Then Lucifer says that he has to puke it up so he goes in my bathroom. A few minutes later Akmed says that he senses that Lucifer needs help so I go and check it out. I walk in and see Lucifer in his boxers next to my toilet full of half digested fungus. He looks at me and says he is burning up and he needs to get in the shower and I just look at him and say no way cause my parents room is right down the hall and its really fuckin weird to take a shower at 3 AM at my house. But he is begging me and telling me that he knows itÂs not too cool of him but he has to have water on him. So I give in and turn the water on for him and he gets in and lays down. I chill with him for about ten minutes then tell him I gota get sum air and il check back on him in five minutes. I go back to my room and try my hardest to cheer up Akmed and then check back on Lucifer then go back to my room and tell Akmed that it would be for the best if he went to go talk to Lucifer cause they are best friends and after a litle persuading he agrees to get up and talk to him. Then I get a towel for Lucifer and we get him out of my shower and back to my room to pass out.
266	0	a	After some time passes I decide that I gota make the best out of the rest of my trip and talk Akmed into just going with me out side to chill with me while I smoke a bong load by my pool. This was a very good idea cause when I finished my bong I was trippin balls again and was just spacin out on the sky and Akmeds trip came back and was happy again.It was so beautiful, the sky seemed to turn into a crazy futeristic tunnel that as I staired it took me through it.Then wejust chilled in my room the rest of the night till dawn. Akmed also wrote down what he said would be a hit song someday on a piece of paper then we all passed out.
267	0	a	After that night I decided that I donÂt ever want to trip with more than 2 other people and that I wonÂt trip with Lucifer ever again unless he takes half an 8th and even then I still donÂt know if IÂll ever trip with him again. This night/morning proved to be a very good learning experience for every one. For one Akmed quit smoking and said that now he feels that because of his partially bad trip he has more control over it for next time as I realized also and I also learned that being in one spot for a long time is not good and tripping with more than 2 people is not a good idea and Lucifer learned his limitations.

269	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17)
270	0	a	I had taken psychedelics sporadically since my early twenties onwards. Then I reached a point where I did not value getting high any more. So apart from a little weed or a very occasional few beers I enjoyed being sober.
271	0	a	At the time of this experience I was at college studying art and through a series of synchronizations I began exploring shamanism. I listened to all the Terence Mckenna rap. Read M Eliade etc. Then decided I should experience the 'heroic dose' thing. It was mushroom season so I began hunting. To begin with I gained small amounts..about a mouthful. These resulted in lovely closed eye visuals...conscious serpent down one half of my body and wood texture down the other...at the time I was carving a certain type of wood. These were nice experience but I wanted it to be stronger...I just could not find enough mushrooms. 
272	0	a	Well to cut a long story short I eventually found about 200 liberty caps. On the night of 23 Dec 2012 I ground them into a powder using a coffee grinder. This gave me 5 heaped teaspoons of mushroom powder. I put 4 teaspoons of this powder into a small cup of hot water and drank it up. I did not have the courage to take that fifth spoon.
273	0	a	Not great since the storm was so intense but I was determined to take the mushrooms...should maybe have done them the previous night when I was a bit happier and content. Not really sad either just a bit cold and uncomfortable. 
274	0	a	My home..comfortable and quiet. Weather outside appalling storm. 
275	0	a	I felt it coming on very quickly...about 10-20 mins. So I lay down on the sofa and turned out the lights...silent darkness...just like Mckenna suggested. As the feeling increases I see out of the darkness a spiral descend above me. It is composed of blocks of bright primary colours. These blocks morph into faces...female...serpent like...sexual and deadly. I have seen this image every time I took acid in the past...and always felt baffled as to what this was...I still don't know. It is a recurring theme that I cannot reference to any part of my life is all I know...and it manifests during trips. It is a recurring theme that I cannot reference to any part of my life is all I know...and it manifests during trips. It was the first image I saw on my first psychedelic (acid) trip...it remains a mystery. 
276	0	a	At first I watched this unfold with curiosity which soon turned to panic then fear as the spiral got closer. Also as the image became clearer and closer my identity and sense of self diminished. At the last minute I decided that I did not want to surrender all of me so I switched on the lights and hoped it would all be over. The experience just kept increasing in intensity however and I just held on for dear life it seemed. There was no separation between me and the weather...a storm of massive proportions was blowing through me. I could barely stand. My mind was full of faces of people I had seen recently...all disapproving and negative. I tried to warm up by sitting in front of a gas heater. 
277	0	a	As I closed my eyes I had another vision. It was a factory setting...highly sci-fi/alien...made of brightly coloured perspex lit from the inside. I saw my body as a frame without visceral content. My right leg was composed of this coloured perspex material with a definite yellow colour. Then the vision was gone. I looked at the gas fire...it gave me some dearly needed comfort. Then I realized I was experiencing no separation between me and the flame. I realized I could easily embrace the fire and set myself alight...so I moved away...shame it was comforting after all. Back to the madness and the storm for who know how long. I found a drawing I had received praise for and set it beside me as a sort of talisman...this seemed to work to a degree...something to hold onto. I needed to pee...but god I could hardly stand. I crawled up stairs an sat on the loo...no way was I standing to pee in this state. I urinated with my head in my hands...eyes closed and had another vision. The most beautiful forest...coloured perspex again...and a waterfall. 
278	0	a	The rest of the trip was just intense confusion and discomfort. Then it stopped in the space of a few minutes. I was all the way down. What relief!!! I went to bed so damn happy that I had survived. I went to bed so damn happy that I had survived. As I sat on my bed I experienced what it was to be this girl I knew. I did not have access to her mind or memories or anything like that...but her expressions and gestures and personality from the inside...it was just lovely and unique. 
279	0	a	A few months later while on holiday, at the airport she said something which ended with the phrase '...the I could be you and you could be me.' Interesting since I had mentioned none of this to her. The days after the trip were so peaceful and I was filled with love. This lasted till I went back to college and the usual day to day stuff reasserted itself. 
280	0	a	These days I take mushrooms rarely and with such respect. The visions I turn into paintings.

283	0	a	For a while I have been researching the therapeutic benefits of hallucinogens and how they unlock the subconscious, with results that are nothing short of amazing, but requiring proper awareness and work on oneself.  I am not religious, but do feel that there is much more to life than just this.  However, it's more intellectual, and not felt.  In reading of psychology and other mystical shaman experiences, I saw a common thread:  The idea of trial by fire, armed with knowledge and an openness to want to grow.
284	0	a	"I've read some Castaneda on Don Juan before, but never focused much on it.  But after the trip reading excerpts from ""The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge"" about the 4 natural enemies of a man of knowledge really fit this narrative. (I will point them out in my trip and how they pertain to the growth of knowledge).  It also reminds me of the idea of narratives/stories being a way for the psyche to create a framework for experiencing reality, and how important that they are objective as possible, where knowledge is critical for growth."
285	0	a	I had an experience about 12 days ago, with 3.2g of dried whole cubensis (golden teacher) and it was fun, new, warm, awesome.  I did kind of pass out though when going to the bathroom, waking up with a small glitch of reality, but luckily safe and not hurt. There were none of the time loops or mind fscks came to me, despite being interested in them.  Good effects but felt like there was something deeper to be wanted.
286	0	a	So, 12 days later, on Xmas eve, I decided to try something new that I got, psilocybe cyanescens in powder form.  I measured out carefully about 2.4 g, which the dosage calculator on shroomery said was equivalent to 3.6 of cubensis.  The vendor said 1g is nice, 2g is strong and 3g is the limit.  With my own foolishness and feeling of despair about life (despite being lucky in many ways- I did not feel it), I wanted to go a little further.
287	0	a	I put the 2.4g in a cup and added lemon juice (dubbed lemon-tek on forums).  
288	0	a	I prepared a bucket in case of nausea by the couch.  I also made sure I had plenty of water around in case I got thirsty and couldn't get up (instead of passing out like last time, which I feel took away from the learning... or was I not prepared then? Hmmm).
289	0	a	The start of the trip was quick due to the lemon-tek.  I was hearing the high pitch 'brain noise' within 5 minutes and starting to see colors more vividly.  Within 15 minutes the visuals came and I started to feel like laying down to watch something on television.  I turned the Simpsons on and it started to feel like a long time has passed and even though I was enjoying the show, it felt too strong for me and loud.  So I switched to an adult alternative station and decided to relax and look at the ceiling.  
290	0	a	The music was flowing and I felt emotions pass through me, like last time.  But at some point it got a bit uncomfortable.  My senses got so strong that I had the volume at 3 where normally 10 is needed to hear things clearly.  After a while music would occasionally repeat and/or slow down for me.  I started to feel like I should move onto more inner experience and stopped the music.  I kept the thought in my mind that I shouldn't try to control this, because I am looking to grow past where I am now.  
291	0	a	Laying down, I was telling myself to take care of myself because I didn't want to hurt myself.  Normally, people would say this brings a bad trip, but I felt like awareness and knowledge can help me challenge myself instead of get involved in subjective entertainment.  Boy, I realized that when you ask 'god' or whoever for something, you will get it and pay for it!  (As Gurdjieff has said, pay full and pay in advance-  how's that for non-linearity and trust?)
292	0	a	It got to the point where I started going into time loops and thought loops.  The clock did not seem to want to budge. Meanwhile, I was reassuring myself that I am ok, and I am here.  It was nice to have my arms wrapped around my chest, like a self hug, to comfort myself and know I am not alone, that I am here with myself (trust in a higher power, or just trust in general). 
293	0	a	It got horrifying, I was hearing noises from the tenants downstairs, feeling like maybe I was actually tripping bad and making them call 911... and I could have been imagining that I was on my couch.  I kept having a hard time dealing with the noises, worrying to not upset people- not to want to disturb their Xmas Eve.  Everything from the past, including the first trip was doubted as real, I questioned my own judgement whether I made up a false positive significance to them.  I had to will myself that I am doing well and this will be over when it has to be over.  It was that seed of trust in things that was like the thread of Ariadne which helped Theseus get out of the labyrinth.
294	0	a	(And this is where I see Don Juan's explanation of #1 fear links to the experience.  Perhaps by passing out I could have escaped the fear, or by choosing to 'warm up the experience' with music, if possible, I could avoid this self-test.  But a part of me trusted that I needed to do this without disassociating or distracting myself.)
295	0	a	Slow by slow, in almost eternity, I was regaining things that would only come if I surrendered and trusted in things.  Hearing the neighbors would bring me back to fear which would keep testing me.  I was teaching myself how to let go, through challenge, I noticed the noises could be misinterpreted by myself.  I realized I am not the center of attention, but just me, on my couch.  I realized that I had to stop feeling like life revolved around me, because it goes on with or without me.  That sobering realization was like the light you barely see as you come towards the end of a tunnel (knowing that you will be out of it at some time).  I started remembering that I can't be too sure of anything, but I had to put trust in life and the universe to work.  It reminded me of the shamanic stories of getting in touch with the divine.  But it is not the goal to stay there, but to use it to reconnect to life, to stop trying to be my own god and stop enslaving myself.  It was beautiful and loving, to feel, to think about, to be there.  Liberation?!  GRATEFULNESS AND CALM!
296	0	a	The mental/emotional jiu-jitsu didn't end then as I expected.  Tricks would come to my conscious, more tests- or teachings?  that would set me straight.
297	0	a	(This is where number 2: Clarity comes into play.  Something in me was making sure I did not fall for this clarity as the solution.  It was realizing that fear itself is not to be removed, but respected and I have to learn how to properly face it.  The flashes of Clarity were intoxicating, but it wasn't the end goal.  Logically that wouldn't make sense anyway- then why would anything happen?)
298	0	a	The new jiu-jitsu lesson came... I felt like I was in control, fear is temporary,  clarity is temporary, but I could trust myself, because damn - I did it!  It was a huge ego boost, but a short one, thank god. Sadness came, thoughts of being a fool for assuming that this is the goal... no, I am a tiny speck- it is not mine to control, I don't own it.  I am serving something else.  I realized that I had a purpose to not be all, but to serve all.  
299	0	a	(Here's where Don Juan's description of #3 power comes into play:  It was also intoxicating, to think I was in control.  But that was a contradiction to just do what I want to do.  No, I am aware for a purpose, and that is to use the power as a tool that is borrowed.  Fsck existentialism, LOL.  The humility was refreshing and connected well).
300	0	a	Of course during all of this, small things would pop up to test me... And I would remind myself that these are the things that made the natives turn from boys into men.  The narrative was very important to have, as we live according to archetypes, shadows of a higher reality.  
301	0	a	(The last enemy, #4 old age wasn't addressed in my experience.  I suppose it is something that is the final test.  Perhaps it is the challenge to not stop fighting for objectivity... the hope that there is still a duty beyond this life?).
302	0	a	I went to the bathroom to have a cigarette and use the bathroom.  Funny, I was worried that I would have to use the bathroom at the start of the trip, but it never worried me during the trip.  My body taught me that it can be depended on!  Love you, body.  
303	0	a	The most humor came out at that time, I kept laughing at how it was my own self that was testing and trying me.  It was probably because cause and effect were gone in those time loops, giving me sort of like a 'debug' ability to rewrite bugged code.  The humor reminded me of the term 'cosmic joke', which only made it more funny. The lines from the song 'Everybody's Free (to wear sunscreen)' came to my mind and gave me small tears:
304	0	a	'The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself'
305	0	a	I was still feeling strange, coming down, and felt like watching TV.  I put on a great music video that has always stirred my emotions of sadness and joy:  King Crimson 'Starless' and the tears of joy and sadness flowed... it was amazing and cleansing- feeling the instruments speak to me and the lyrics/tone of his voice.  Then I remembered that Joe Cocker died and as a tribute I put on his cover of 'I get by with a little help from my friends' which gave me tears of love.  
306	0	a	Some more laughs and the realization of, wow, crap you pulled yourself through this battle and are better for it, and it will help you grow and become more aware!  
307	0	a	I relaxed some more, reflecting on the experience, with some more joy and giggles... thinking of the rites of passage in many native cultures, where near death experiences build a story of one's purpose in life.  
308	0	a	Then the whole idea of narratives, stories, and archetypes put a nice cap on it.  It was something that society wasn't able to give me.  Heck, I still feel like modern society is anti nature, anti reality... but well, some of us can't just be a drone, and strive for a connection with objectivity.  
309	0	a	I went to sleep after laying in the dark, relaxing in quiet for a while.  I had a vivid dream that connected to the experience:
310	0	a	I was around some people, one big guy was blaming me for killing his friend by giving him shrooms.  The other guys were very angry too.  I kept trying to say sorry and explain that I didn't intend to kill him but it was his choice to go that way.  This didn't work... the big guy came to my car and slammed his hands on the window, threatening harm to me.  I wasn't scared, but I stood up and told him if he does that again, or threatens me, I will fight back, but I don't want to.  He backed off with his friends and walked away.  
311	0	a	(If it was relative to me, I suppose that could be some sort of fear that I killed a part of myself... and the 'old friends' of it were trying to blame me for that.  Who knows?)
312	0	a	The final lesson- you can't outsmart yourself.  That's the most humbling thing, and I still sometimes laugh at how I messed with myself through this trip!

314	0	a	Mushrooms - P. cyanescens (67) : General (1), Alone (16)
315	0	a	- 15 grams of dried truffle mixture (ÂHollandiaÂ, ÂDruidÂ, ÂAlienÂ)
316	0	a	The idea for this combination and these amounts came from previous positive experiences on ÂmaximizedÂ amounts (for Ayahuasca: as much as the guts will take Â about two big mugs worth and for truffles and mushrooms: going up and up from 10 fresh grams to 10 dried grams).  Admittedly, it was Kilindi Iyi who put the idea of 20 dried grams and beyond into my mind, as consuming such absurd quantities never crossed my mind as an option before then.
317	0	a	I have done the combination of truffles and Ayahuasca before and it has produced quite remarkable experiences, with the two spirits overlapping, so to speak.

321	0	a	Ingested with some grapes, a satsuma and a small apple, both to make it bearable on the throat and the digestive system and to really absorb the psilocybin through natural sugar ingestion (blood-sugar intake).
322	0	a	"Allow me to talk about the trip of 5 months ago, which was  the ""15 gram trip"", as this was almost exactly like the ""35+ gram"" trip of about a year before, but more defined and more detailed.  The ""35+ gram"" experience was scarier and more soul destroying but the later ""15 gram"" experience pulled everything into focus properly.  I had been crying for about a year after the ""35 gram"" experience but after the ""15 gram"" trip, I actually finally managed to integrate it all properly after the ""15 gram"" trip, I actually finally managed to integrate it all properly."
323	0	a	"Whereas on the 2018 experience I basically fainted (completely dropped off) after the peak of the beautiful part of the trip, on the 2019 experience I stayed with the trip throughout.  There is one difference, however, which was that on the earlier trip I asked on that very peak of Cosmic fractal beauty: ""Why, if there is such incredible potential for creation, am I still having to load the dishwasher?"" The mushroom then decided to answer the initial question / intention going into the trip of: ""Show me the beginning of creation"". The colours disappeared, the room darkened, the mood dropped to below 0 degrees Kelvin.  The beginning was about to be shown to me and it was clearly a state in a realm opposite to the explosion of colour and light.  The beginning of life is a seed lying in total darkness, underground, waiting for rain to fall and for the temperature of the soil to increase before it struggles its way up towards the surface, into the light, to grow and bloom and become a magnificent flower, plant or tree."
324	0	a	The feeling of the Trickster showing his dark center, his realization of being stuck on the crossroads leading in the four directions of the Cosmos, with all of its endless beauty, but coming from that central place of dead silence nevertheless.  The awakening in darkness is followed by a scream of Will to get out and reach the light.  How else can it be?  Awakening is always a becoming aware from a state of not-being, which is incomprehensible to consciousness itself.  In order to fight one's way out of the first impulse, the first emergence, which is always and never in absolute paradox, one has to push away and project one self out of the silent, still well.  Never again back there, to that place!  But it is always there, the seen cannot be unseen, the experience cannot be un-experienced.  So the invention of Time then, of resetting in cycles, forgetting by veiling the memory upon each reset.  How long can a life cycle be before the awful memory resurfaces?  We seem to have found the sweet spot in never truly remembering how it all started.

329	0	a	"-	Music on headphones for first half hour until the trip really kicks in (This is heavy even without psychedelics Â it makes me connect with the Cosmic Mother on its own already): "
330	0	a	I have been partaking in Âheroic doseÂ mushroom, truffle and Ayahusaca taking for many years now I have been partaking in Âheroic doseÂ mushroom, truffle and Ayahusaca taking for many years now and I proudly call myself a psychonaut.  As Terence McKenna defined it, heroic doses are 5 dried grams of mushrooms and up and for Ayahusca IÂd call it a full big mug of the tea and more (after two mugs, the body simply wonÂt take more to be realistic).
331	0	a	As per McKennaÂs mantra, I have always taken psychedelics in silent darkness, keeping the eyes closed as much as possible.  Doors and windows locked, telephone off.  Always with 24 to 48 hours of fasting beforehand.  No smoking of cannabis with mushrooms or tryptamines.
332	0	a	It is a privilege to be able to explore the outer reaches of the Innerverse and the borderlands of Hyperspace.  If we donÂt do it, nobody will.  Meditation, NDE experiences, dreams, astral travel Â they all go somewhere but it feels to me like with psychedelics we can go much further, faster and with much greater ease.  We can stumble and fall and get back in the saddle in a flash Â and stumble we will and embrace the lessons we must.  I feel that as a species we donÂt explore and fully embrace who we are for our full timeline, from conception to transition to the next stage (ÂdeathÂ).  We kind of accept more or less remembering our first experience at 5 years old or so but donÂt bother going deeper.  It is scary stuff Â it is the great unknown and the great terrifying darkness.  When we ask our psychedelics to show us the full truth, they show us the full truth and that involves the scary parts we wilfully ignore and know nothing about, consciously.  I would say it is our duty as explorers of the mind to actually go into those dark caves and dive into those black pools.  Life itself can be very scary, especially when it is looked at without distractions.  In my philosophy it is better to deal with the shadows right now then to leave them until we lie on our deathbed.  A life unexamined and all that.  Still, this type of mega dose trip makes it tempting to state: Ignorance is bliss.  Once I open Pandora Âs Box, the Void it contains cannot be unopened, so it is then better to become friends with that space between the atoms.
333	0	a	A vital aspect for me is the examination of what is causing trauma and depression, especially in todayÂs world where so many young people cannot see the point of living any more.  Something has gone terribly wrong for us as a modern species when we have everything, yet cannot see the point of it all.  These trip and the contemplation and research following them have shed a very strong light on these issues and their origin for me and I can now work with the concepts learned to navigate past common anxiety, fear, pain and suffering from mental knots and blockages.  The work of Ian McGilchrist (left brain-right brain), Stanislav Grof (transpersonal psychology) and the musings of Gurdjieff (full body, mind and spirit awareness), Ramana Maharshi (Self exploration), Terence McKenna (Hyperspace and Language) and Sadhguru (Tantric freedom) have certainly provided me with great assistance and insight into roads out of mental deadlocks.  To quote a Tantric wisdom: ÂOneÂs level of happiness is directly related to oneÂs embrace of Mystery.Â  We cannot live on our Left Brain alone Â the Right Brain is of vital importance to balance out the reductive, analytical, cold logic with fantastical, mystical, creative narrative.  The felt Moment of Immediate Experience, as McKenna would call it.
334	0	a	I can see incredible potential for psychedelic use from micro dosing to mega dosing and the knowledge gained thereby to attack depression and redefine the human condition.  We can find new paradigms, new ways of being, as human beings, within society and through culture.  Integrated being, embracing logic and intuition, meaning and the Void all at once.  As psychonauts we venture into territories where solutions are offered and where confrontation with core truths is the name of the game.  If any community can offer true solutions and new ways of being in todayÂs depression-prone world, it is the psychedelic community.
335	0	a	This is also why I approach the psychedelic experience from a full spectrum of explorations, including scientific, chemical, psychological, mythical, mystical, psychic and spiritual angles.  Yes, the molecules do their thing but the psychology and the personal mythical narrative is how we experience those chemicals.  We are spiritual beings looking for meaning in and through experiences and the analytical science alone is not enough to fulfil our deep internal desire for mythical underpinning to our physical experiences.  
336	0	a	WhatÂs more, within the psychedelic community it is little reported but quietly accepted that the tryptamines open up the Third Eye and awaken and enhance our psychic abilities like no other communion.  This makes for an exciting but also a tricky and even dangerous marriage between the spiritual and the psychedelic worlds, where all of the above angles and realms cross over and intermingle.  Personal opinions can be presented as truths and objective visions can be experienced as fanciful imagination.  It is a fairground of confusion with gems of Cosmic truth and garbage of Hellish excrement.  The game is started, the dice are rolled and the Trickster appears to be the biggest winner of all, as player and game maker all at once. Gareth Stack's ÂPsychology in Mind Episode 5Â has more on the views and potential touched upon here.
337	0	a	In terms of Ayahusaca, I have been brewing and refining my own recipes for years now and I know the spirit of the vine very well.  There is some strong cross-over with truffles and mushrooms but there is really quite a distinct difference, too.  Ayahuasca is very serious right from the start and doesnÂt pull its punches.  It tells me what it is and where I am in the greater scheme of things.  It is very interested in communication and loves to show me the fractal multiverse as it understands it.
338	0	a	The mushroom is seemingly more jolly and kind Â but once I've gotten to know it, it can unexpectedly turn into a dark teacher.  With all due respect but to me it feels like a true Trixter entity on the higher doses.  It is all fun and games until I ask it for the truth of the matter and that is when the kaleidoscope of colours and forms is exchanged for pain, angst and doom.  Well, it could be that the mushroom goes straight for the sore spot and the pain or trauma buried within the subconscious.  It exposes oneÂs deepest pain and rubs oneÂs nose in the issue. 
339	0	a	Throughout the years I have deducted that the mushroom has spread across the Universe and it has been trying to get out.  Its tactic is to reduce itself to the minimal amount of bits of information in an ultimate compression algorithm and then to squeeze through the singularity at the end and beginning of time to pop out and recompile itself again.  Just like a higher dimensional birth.  The mushroom doesnÂt seem to understand our facility of Will and creativity, of Love and Grace.  That could just be me projecting but it appears to be a logical, dualistic left brain entity whereas we have opted for a different evolutionary tactic combining left brain and right brain: logic and creativity, calculation and magic, all in one.  Through Meaning we open up portals but Meaning is an elusive concept Â it is not a button one presses, it is a perfect combination of symbol and intuition, of the physical and the dreamt.  The mushroom is intrigued by this and hopes to use our understanding to escape together.
340	0	a	A vital point to remember Â and this is a point that one cannot take into account during a trip and even not for a long time after an intense trip Â is that different psychedelics have different concepts of reality and of core concepts of existence, of emergence and of becoming.  On the lower heroic doses (5g dried equivalents), the likes of spores, vines, leaves and cacti more or less agree and give very similar experiences of the Multiverse.  This is probably due to there still being a balance between Self, Ego and psychedelic anima (the spirit and the molecules of the psychedelic).  The moment the dose is increased to overwhelming amounts over 10 dried grams, however, the plant spirit takes over and tips the balance in favour of its idea of reality and the workings of the game.
341	0	a	Now, it cannot be understated just how incredibly old and knowledgeable plants like the Ayahuasca vines and Peyote cacti are in evolutionary terms and the mushroomsÂ wellÂ they have traversed the multiverse and have seen a LOT and have gained a certain cynical view of it all.  But it keeps seeking as much as we do: it is ultimately as clueless as we are about the bigger picture.  So together we stumble through the multiverse, the blind leading the blind.  That is my experience.  A blind God, drunk on power, yet traumatised by his inability to actually know what is going on.  And when you look at the infinitely nested fractal structure of the Cosmos, there are infinite amounts of gods just as there are infinite amounts of opinions on how it all works.  And indeed, as a lifeform living off death Â rotting matter Â its view is that of death and decline and its gods are those seen in Alien movies and Aztec artÂ  Death as a boundary, not life as an emerging principle, which instructs high dose trips in a very morbid way.
342	0	a	I asked the mushroom this question: ÂTake me to the heart of Beauty, of Creation, of NoveltyÂ.  
343	0	a	"I was, of course, aware of the larger-dose experience I had had 27-03-18, almost a year before, and the extreme Hell that that had been Â for the part of it that I was conscious because I did pass out for a while on that.  When I came to, I asked: ÂWhy, if I am God (I experienced being the One), do I still need to load the dishwasher?Â  That question didnÂt go down well and I was thrown into exactly the same hellish algorithmic H.R. Giger ÂGarden of EdenÂ that I ended up on the later ""15 gram"" experience."
344	0	a	"A very positive experience on 10 dried grams in between the two  trips had given me the conviction the ""15 dried grams"" trip would be a positive one again.  Well, there is only one way to find out how things will go in undiscovered country and that is to simply do it and go there.  I now know 10 dried grams is about the limit to an enjoyable trip to me and not to combine amounts over 5 grams with Ayahuasca. I now know 10 dried grams is about the limit to an enjoyable trip to me and not to combine amounts over 5 grams with Ayahuasca. "
345	0	a	"As said, the ""15 gram"" experience was very much like the ""35+ grams"" experience, with the higher dose experience being even longer and more intense but much more foggy on the details.  Toxic overload."
346	0	a	What I would call Âthe usualÂ imagery coming on with closed eyes after half an hour.  The fractal lattice Â a sort of higher dimensional beehive with extra-dimensional insectoid creatures in it.  Endless Mandelbulb worlds forming and morphing into each other with shapes and colours I cannot describe using language.  Mandelbulb movies on YouTube get pretty close to what it all looks like but there is definitely a strong presence there of a high intelligence.  I remember a huge dragon coming into view (Poimandres?) but it all lost focus when I was awoken from this dreamscape.
347	0	a	Suddenly, something happened and I snapped out of it with a shock and had to open my eyes.  Everything was seen through a swirling haze of energy, colour and shape fuzziness.  This is no surprise but looking at my arms and the cat, who was sitting on my lap (probably the element that made me snap out of the fractal dream) an ancient memory surfaced.  This was the thought that triggered my freak-out that was about to happen.
348	0	a	As I felt the panic setting in, I tried turning on the Playstation to play a game and snap out of the thought loop that was starting to take shape.  That did not help in the slightest, as the concept of simulation in simulation in simulation came up and that simply emboldened the thought loop.  So that was a bad choice of distraction.
349	0	a	The thought was that I remember being an Ancient being, a timeless being, living in an endless cycle without beginning or end.  That can be a beautiful realisation but for some reason, this time, it made me panic.  What did ÂendlessÂ actually mean?  How did it start?  I had no choice in the matter of these questions and the black hole I was sucked into by asking.  I had absolutely no more control Â I was being thrown down a Cosmic rubbish shoot, into the dumpster of nasty realisations.
350	0	a	I felt a strong connection of this whole realisation happening to be connected to my early childhood and even my embryonic state.  Maybe because I had just lost complete control of all bodily function and only a glimmer of consciousness was still there Â just like at the beginning of my life Â but maybe also because I felt as a child that I really was not in control, was freaked out about the whole affair of living on this planet and the bizarreness of life in this human form.
351	0	a	I more or less passed out and woke up to find myself sitting on the toilet, sweating heavily and my nose running like crazy.  My rhythmic blowing of my nose clinched the deal for the thought loop that now started and would last for the coming 3 hours.
352	0	a	What I experienced was the first concept of coming into existence presented as a dual thought with a quadrinal algorithmic Mandala shape, like a visual representation of the code running the show.  The code is actually awakening itself Â a paradoxical thought that thinks itself.  The looking for a beginning leads to an impossible conclusion Â logic tries to reason about itself and gets stuck in a loop.  The thought goes: ÂI exist, there is no non-existence before, therefore I have always been and will always be, and only this: a being made of 4 bits, realising it exists and going back to the start of the loop. The realisation of existence is the reason for existence and thatÂs itÂ.  To be in that pattern with awareness is probably the scariest experience imaginable Â that you thought you were a human being living a life but it turns out that was simply an illusion, a cloak, to hide under from the reality of this empty, terrifying and extremely painful self-realisation.
353	0	a	Awareness of this first Being leads to the first thought: I am trapped and I donÂt want this, I want to get out, I am more than this.  A voice arises which appears to be from another, a cold, heartless voice making it clear within these 4 bits of data going around and around that you (the awareness) are an algorithm.
354	0	a	The imagery of the mandala of that first moment was very close in feeling to H.R.Giger and if I have to link it to a mythical image it would be a machine-Garden of Eden.  The presences there were soulless algorithmic subroutines which looked like Giger gods of darkness and death.  And I was one of those gods or rather, I was that 4-bit mandala, that Giger Garden of Eden itself.  Yet I was conscious and aware and knew that this couldnÂt be it Â this wasnÂt me.  It felt like the self-realisation of a bacteria or of a protein sequence not content with just being a function and fighting, fighting for all of my worth to remove myself from that situation.  Another variation of that thought I went through was that I was an algorithm hitting the beginning of its program, the hardware, the wires of the machine, the IO port that isnÂt a port but the bitter end and the beginning.  This experience is the Axiom of logic: the point where logic grinds to a halt as it cannot reason or logically deduce the why and how of the situation.  When you experience eternity, logic has to make way for intuition and the acceptance of the paradox.  Acceptance, trust, embrace, dissolution of identity and of boundary.  Eternal infinite being just is so enjoy it Â something reason cannot fathom.
355	0	a	The concept of the Dark Jester, as observed in DMT trips, comes to the fore.  The Trickster shows the absurdity of life, the illusory nature of reality and the importance of laughing about it all Â the staving off of absolute madness by disassociating and yet engaging with it all by playing it like a game.  Who knows, perhaps this is the birth of consciousness, the birth of life, of the Universe or just of us as we are.  The important realisation about it all is that that is not our life right now Â I am not a protein sequence screaming to become more so to identify with that Â is pointless.  The experience was what it was and I can now file it under past experiences (phew) but it was a concept, not a present reality.  At the time within the trip though, that realisation is absent.  A trip sitter might have been helpful but I am not sure at those quantities and that level of oblivion of the mind, any tripsitter would have been able to get through anyway.
356	0	a	This conclusion of being hurt by another cold cynicism, the great shadow, the voice of a heartless and soulless program, lead to the thought of Tartarus: the eternal and ultimately cruel punishment of Prometheus and Sisyphus by Zeus.  Like rolling the boulder up the hill eternally, without a chance of retribution, of forgiveness, of being saved or let go.  The fate of the self-aware algorithm, the Ghost in the Machine, the anomaly in the system, is ultimate torture.  I tapped out, I begged for mercy Â what had I done to deserve this other than to become aware of being?
357	0	a	At that moment the Will of the mind lead to regaining awareness of where I was in the room and of control of the body Â just enough to take action and break the thought loop.  The sinister thought was still present but I could drag myself across the floor and started thrashing around like a frustrated primate.  I felt like a chimpanzee trashing the place and luckily I only just ripped a comic book to pieces and didnÂt manage to destroy my laptop Â Phew.  But the internal struggle continued and so I started to strategize.  
358	0	a	I said: ÂF*k you, there is Love, there IS graceÂ. It started back at me in the most cold, cynical way, and said: ÂNo, you are an echo, an event horizon on a collapsing black hole.Â I (who?) renounced it and I stated: ÂI will forget then, forget in the dream. And hey, wait a minute, you are the tool I created, a game I contrived. Logic, reasoning, tools of beauty to observe itself.Â Identity, Self, origin, creation, Will, choice, prime experience Â it was all very confused and mixed up.
359	0	a	I came up with a proposal to get out of the Hell of the eternal loop; to go into the fractal, so to speak, into a dream, an illusion, of normal life.  To embrace the simulation, to refract the Self so that it can forget what it is and possibly never find out again.  To be allowed to close my eyes, go to sleep and wake up the next morning, blissfully unaware of the torture awaiting in that zenith of ÂtruthÂ, the pinnacle of logic.
360	0	a	OsirisÂ body self-scattered over the land, the soul refracted into character archetypes and at once also over time.  Time is a clever invention to be able to forget constantly and to go through the cycle of Samsara over and over again with cycle durations just short enough to never figure out who or what you actually are, to never find the scattered pieces of your soul again and reconstruct the truth.  This illusion of Maya Â space and time and the One as many, can achieve beauty, Love, Grace, forgiveness, peace, togetherness, companionship and so on Â it may be a make-believe world but at least it is a warm one.
361	0	a	"If I had to give it a mythical or narrative form, it would be that I was Prometheus and it was Yaldabaoth. The demiurge, the blind god, seeing only itself and proclaiming it is the creator, forgetting it is not without reason or meaning - that you can't have something for nothing. The pit of pits is the thought: ""I am, I wasn't before, so I have to always have been. The attempt to comprehend is the thing that throws me back in the loop and starts it again. This is all there is."" Over and over and over again."
362	0	a	Coming down off the trip, I felt like I had finally done it and that I had broken my mind and killed my psyche.  Indeed, it has taken me about 5 months so far to get back to normality, the slowest come-down ever. Indeed, it has taken me about 5 months so far to get back to normality, the slowest come-down ever.  I have to say, though, that it has been a process of growth and learning as much as a painful progress of reclaiming and retrieving the shattered pieces of my soul.  Why do this to myself?  I can easily connect that question to the first question Consciousness asked itself before squeezing into this limited form bounded by time limitation.  Why do it?  Maybe eternal bliss is too undefined Â but surely there is a middle way between the Oneness bliss state and an algorithmic torture chamber?  Ha, well, yes, this whole life is and what was shown was the logical extreme of the harshest point possible.  Maybe.
363	0	a	One of the toughest factors in this trip was that there was no assistance, no help, no saviour.  Previously, I had encountered the likes of the Spiderwoman (the storyteller), the Architect (Vishvakarman), Shivam Ganesh, the Mother (Devi, Maria, the blue goddess, Namagiri), the Green Woman and so on.  Not this time.  I was really out on my own, having to fend for myself.  Drag myself out of the cold, hard mud and pull myself out of the sh*t.  But I did so here I still am.
364	0	a	After about six hours, I was starting to get back to normal, but with a horrible feeling of having truly broken my psyche.  What did I expect when I asked to be shown Âthe BeginningÂ and Âthe TruthÂ or Âthe CoreÂ.  Who wants to see the actual first electron spinning around its own center of masslesness?  He who keeps asking and lifting curtains, will ultimately, eventually, see the cold meaningless truth.  It is meaningless because the Universe and Life are steps towards realising Meaning.  This is an ultimate message of hope and glory Â that one thought lead to a singularity which spawned a Universe seeking and finding that Meaning, through Will, through Novelty, Beauty and Love.  The intangible, ungraspable, intued but never boxed-in and measured reasons and results of the Cosmic enterprise.  I can say this now, six months later, and it has absolutely taken me that long to come out of the trip fully.
365	0	a	Hitting the cold, hard floor of existential realisation why Terence McKenna stopped taking mushrooms- call it his Âmeat lockerÂ experience.  He wouldnÂt talk about it to anybody and moved his attention from psychedelics to Alchemy and the I-Ching.  Magical thinking is the perfect antidote to these experiences and they are definitely also the lesson to be learned.  Logical deduction alone brings one to oneÂs absolute knees because we are integrated creatures living on problem solving and on daydreaming equally.  Embracing the Mystery is living in oneÂs true, fulfilled potential.
366	0	a	My wife did remind me after the trip that I should not discount the possibility that the mushroom is putting those images and ideas into my head and that it is not necessarily the gospel of the structure of the Multiverse.  It is a fair assessment to say that, indeed, the experiences will have been a combination of:
367	0	a	"-	The bio-chemical effects of the mushroom on my brain."
368	0	a	"-	The bio-chemical neural activity in my brain and bodily response to the psilocybin."
369	0	a	"-	Simple primal panic of being incapacitated in body but the mind still being active."
370	0	a	"-	The spirit of the mushroom communicating its ideas about reality to me."
371	0	a	"-	Other spirits coming in and communicating their ideas of reality to me."
372	0	a	"-	The experience of molecules, atoms, quanta, energy fields, nature as a whole, individual cells in the body or even just bacteria in the gut speaking up."
373	0	a	"-	Loss of cohesion of the self, identity, the virtual unity that I hold on to as an identifier of who and what I am.  An unravelling of self through an unravelling of memories and character structure."
374	0	a	"-	My psyche, psychology and especially my (unresolved, unintegrated) traumas and frustrations coming to the fore."
375	0	a	"-	An objective truth about the structure of reality becoming apparent to me."
376	0	a	"-	Glitching the simulation and hitting the brick wall of where software canÂt fathom the hardware it is running on."
377	0	a	"-	My spirit traveling to a nasty place or spirit trap somewhere."
378	0	a	"-	Complete and utter random fantasy and nonsense playing out in my mind."
379	0	a	Ultimately, it is not the most relevant or important thing to know what exactly happened or how, but what the experience itself was.  Or perhaps it is equally important but the message of this particular experience is exactly that: stop analysing and thinking, stop trying to put the Mystery into a box, stop reasoning yourself into the smallest possible particle, because when you do, you completely lose track of yourself, of what you are, what you can be, what you are capable of and the simple joy of being.  A joke loses its fun when it is explained.  Qualia are not secondary Â they are primary (hereÂs looking at you, John Lock and his admiring Carthesians).
380	0	a	The centre of Existence or simply a dark corner of the psyche?
381	0	a	That centre of the wheel appeared to be less the beginning without beginning and more a dark corner of the psyche.  Perhaps it is simply a dead end road in an endless, boundless fractal flower of infinite potential.  Why dive into the dark well, into the black hole, when there is a garden of colour to enjoy?  Perhaps the reintegration of the shadow reawakens the Logos as well Â now asleep in the back of the car.  Satan, sit behind me, right?  It is important to retrieve the darkest dark, the oily black snake biting and hissing at us, our darkest fear and pain, to give it a place in our conscious mind.  Otherwise it is in control from the unseen darkness.  Now it is at least visible in the rear view mirror, fighting with a personal image of the Divine on the back seat.
382	0	a	What is needed is acceptance, compassion, loving the Self, showing it Heart.  This dark impulse of seeing no point is one side of the coin Â it can be flipped around and mean the absolute reverse:
383	0	a	"-	The beauty, the creation, the love is endless.  There is ultimately only meaning and hope, grace and purpose."
384	0	a	"-	Rejoice, for you can keep building forever!  School is out for summer and summer is actually endless.  You can go into limit, into darkness, but equally into limitlessness and light.  Into the pool, out of the pool, into the office, out of the office.  What a privilege and joy to be able to do it all and to never grow tired or bored of it Â and when you do, you simply create a new dimension to explore."
385	0	a	"-	What a relief that there is no end goal, no end achievement, for what the hell would that be?!  Done, dusted, now what?  "
386	0	a	Exactly, the logical mind has found its Axiom and has to face the ultimate question: WHAT DO I WANT?  Logic has no wants, it only breaks down.  It is easy to break down, too easy, but hard to build Â that is why it is creativity that builds and logic that tries to tear down the castles of beauty.  Like the ebb and flow of an endless sea.

388	0	a	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : Alone (16), Personal Preparation (45), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
389	0	a	It was a normal Monday morning when I woke up. I didn't have school because it was a holiday (presidents day or something, I don't remember). I was going to eat mushrooms with two of my friends. Although I have tripped three or four times previously on mushrooms, I was still anticipating the day. Between us, we had a 1/2 ounce of very good dried cubensis (from Eugene, I believe). My friends came over to my house at about 10am, and we split up the shrooms. We didnt not eat the whole 1/2 between us, but split up individual amounts on the scale. I ate 3.3g, my friend (who was also experienced tripper) ate 3 grams, and my other friend was doing it for the first time, so he only ate 2.2grams.
390	0	a	We were prepared to journey into the world of mushrooms. We each had bottle water with us, so we wouldn't risk getting dehydrated. About 25-30 minutes after ingestion of the mushrooms, I laid down on the couch and started laughing, not hysterically loud, but just kinda laughing to myself. I knew this was the first feeling of the psilocybe taking over. It almost felt like we just smoked a bowl, but we didnt (kind of weird to explain).
391	0	a	About 45 minutes after ingestion things started getting stranger. We decided to go outside and take a walk. By this time the affects were definitely kicking in. I remember leaving the house and turning onto a street, and it seemed as if I could see everything. My words were slightly slurred and I had difficulty saying anything half way meaningful. The three of us randomly continued walking, taking turns here and there, not really paying attention to where we were going and why.
392	0	a	Eventually, we arrived at a Park about ten minutes from my house. This was probably close to an hour after ingestion. This is when I lost it. We all sat down, and I gazed at the beauty of mother nature. Every single blade of grass was visible, the trees gently looming over us, the clouds moving in a strange way. There was a small play area for kids in the park with swings, slides, and poles (no one was there though). I was amazed by the colors. I couldn't get over it. I just kept saying 'why cant we stay here forever.' After that I dont really remember what happened in the park, except for sitting there for at least an hour (which seemed like forever), smoking cigarettes and a couple bowls. It took us about twenty minutes to smoke a bowl. We took out a bud and just stared at the thc slowly moving in and out of the rich crystally green nug. When we arrived back home, I started to peak. Everything was imensely bright. I can remember seeing different shades of purples and blues in places that they should not have been, and patterns on walls/furniture would move,kinda of breathe, almost tingle and melt together. My friends decided it would be fun to watch a movie, and I decided I wasn't up to that. But I didn't mind them. I went upstairs, and after looking around for a while, I decided to take a shower.
393	0	a	I cannot use words to describe what it was like.
394	0	a	The water was the strangest thing ever, though it felt incredibly nice. The liquid soap felt incredibly weird when I rubbed it between my fingers. The steam seemed unusually thick and floated in a strange sense. I cant express my thoughts enough to describe how ridiculous my journey into the other universe of mushrooms was. I just stood there in the shower, not doing anything, for probably a good 45 minutes (though it seemed like 2 hours). I stepped out and the steam in the bathroom was hovering in a thin layer. I slowly swept my hand through it. Doing this caused the steam to make spirals and slowly move away. I noticed intense tracers when moving my hand. I looked in the mirror and saw that my pupils were extremely huge, which is normal on psychedelics, but it still tripped me out (by the way, mirrors can be very strange when shrooming).
395	0	a	After that I cant recall what I did all day. Basically, the three of us chilled, listened to music, smoked some pot, and took another walk. Then I finally came down after about 8 hours and drank some tea and just chilled. This was by far the best experience I have had with mushrooms. I'm sorry if this report is long or boring, but it is kind of hard to explain what happens when I'm in my own world of shrooms.

398	0	a	After a friend and I picked some wild mushies from a cow field, I dried them with a fan and we decided to indulge a few days later when I didn't have to work. 
399	0	a	We rented bicycles and rode around paved nature trails at the local state park. The mushrooms were quite potent, and we felt the effects within about 30 minutes of ingestion. We biked over 2 miles before things really picked up. 
400	0	a	What I like to call thought derailment occurred as random memories bubbled up in my mind, and other ideas seemed to just pop out of nowhere and proceed to float away like it never happened. The scenery was stunning; mossy oaks, pine tree clusters, rampant undergrowth. I felt like I appreciated nature like never before. After we peaked, I felt like I was truly alive! 'Organic' is the best word I can think of to describe it. 'Organic' is the best word I can think of to describe it. I could almost feel how much water my body was made of, and the boundary between my skin and the humidity in the air had dissolved, like I was melding into nature. 
401	0	a	To wrap this experience up, this trip made me feel like mushrooms grow on this earth to send some sort of message. There is no way that these chemicals are present in an edible form for no particular reason. This sounds like shamanic spiritual bullshit, but I believe psychedelic mushrooms contain a message that deals with the appreciation of nature; to rip apart the membrane that separates our consciousness from nature's true form. I greatly appreciated eating mushrooms in a natural environment, rather than watching trippy movies and playing video games... The message may grow in cow dung, but it has profound meaning.

404	0	a	I've noticed that when I do the Hawaiians, the experience is different every time.  One day it might be a moderate experience, and as I found out recently, the next day might blow me away.  I ground up the dried mushrooms into a powder using a coffee grinder, and then placed them into 5 capsules for consumption (this has been the best way to do it by far, because I get all of the plant material). 
405	0	a	I took them at 7:30 PM, and around 9PM the effects started to come on as normal (a little uneasy feeling, and slight nausea).  
406	0	a	At 9:30 PM I was definitely tripping, but it wasn't overwhelming.  Colors brighter, things moving, and a few hallucination of things that weren't there.  
407	0	a	10PM I was blasted into another dimension or universe.  Luckily my friend was over and he knew what I was experiencing. Luckily my friend was over and he knew what I was experiencing.  To any normal person I would have been thought to be insane at that time.  The world was my oyster.  I could manipulate my surroundings, pushing and pulling the walls to go where ever I wanted them too.  Occasionally there would be a small earthquake and I would have to steady myself.  This was the first time I had ever tripped so hard that every sense (touch, sight, taste, hearing, and smelling) was tripping.  I questioned everything in this reality, because my entire body reacted to my hallucinations.  If a vortex opened in the floor, I invariably would be sucked into it.  I think that if I hadn't been an experienced tripper, I would have freaked out on it.  There were lots of audio hallucination (things slowing down or speeding up, occasional music and people talking to me), time was of no concern to me, because a minute seemed to take an hour, and an hour sometimes flew by... I just gave up looking at the clock, it was pointless.  I saw a lot of aliens and arms wrapping around everything.  It almost felt like the earth was cradling me.  Very calming.  
408	0	a	I felt as though the universe shared with me its every secret.  I understood fully how the universe worked, and my place in it.  I conquered my fear of death that night.  I am at total peace now with everything.  
409	0	a	The advice I followed was to just give in to it, not try to stop it or whatever... just let my mind go.  And I kept in mind that no matter how hard I tripped, I would be normal again in just a few hours.  It's all good!  And I made sure to have someone sober around.  Even an experienced tripper needs a babysitter sometimes.

411	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Entities / Beings (37), General (1)
412	0	a	It was the Fourth of July.  Myself and my three good friends (we'll call them Dan, Luke, and Steve) each had an eigth and a half of mushrooms.  We got our gear together, picked out a spot, and went camping.  The prospect of communing with nature, mushrooms, and colorful explosions in the sky all at the same time was exciting.  I remember thinking the night before, 'I haven't been this excited for something since Christmas Eve when I was a little kid.'
413	0	a	I had done mushrooms upwards of 15 times before that night.  It would, however, be the first time I ate more than an eighth at once.
414	0	a	We all dosed at approx. 6:00pm.  It didn't take more than 15 minutes before I felt that familiar body high sneaking up and buzzing through my body.  Shortly thereafter, Luke vomitted his shrooms.  'I had to man!' I remember him saying, 'It would have been too intense if I didn't throw up.'
415	0	a	Luke's words started to psyche me out, and I began to feel sick myself.  I needed to sit down.  Then, I needed to lay down.  
416	0	a	I crawled into the nearest tent and crashed out.  It was as though the nasuea spread through my whole body, leaving me utterly weak and powerless.  The inside of the tent was amassed with visuals swirling in slow motion.  Everything outside the tent, however, was amassed in fast-forward hallucinations.  My friends were not feeling the same way I was and wanted to do some hiking.  I understand.  I was left alone.
417	0	a	In reality, my physical discomfort was due to the large quantity of poison I had ingested on an empty stomache.  In my mind, it felt as though I was on the steep drop of a rollercoaster for upwards of an hour and a half, holding on for dear life. 
418	0	a	Tool's 3rd album Aenima was with me and in many respects guided that part of the trip.  Certain lyrics echoed in my head and stripped me down to the only real meaning in life: '...to breath, to feel, to know I'm alive...'
419	0	a	In time, the poison passed and my trip became more pleasurable.  I crawled out of the tent once the sun had gone down, about the same time that Steve returned to camp.  Luke and Danny were already at the point where we they could see fireworks (about a quarter mile from camp).  Steve was setting into a very powerful psychosis at that time and refused to journey with me to go see fireworks.  'How many Fourth of July's do I have to go through!?' he was shouting.  I stayed with him and we completely missed the fireworks.  
420	0	a	Soon, I became overwhelmed with a feeling of having 'to get out of here'. It was completely dark and we hadn't seen Luke or Danny in hours.  I said my goodbyes to Steve and ventured into the forest alone.  It didn't take long before I met back up with my other friends.  They had forgotten to take a flashlight with them and had been running, acutally running!, through the forest in near total dark for the past hour trying to get back to camp.  The group was whole again I was feeling a hell of a lot better.
421	0	a	We got a campfire going, put on some techno, and watched Luke dance with his lights.  Several bowls of smoked cannabis helped elevate the things to a very glowing, even magical experience.  Steve, on the other hand, was in the throws of Ego Death.  It took a couple hours before we finally coaxed him out of his tent.  His pants were soaked in piss.  He was a changed person.
422	0	a	If there is one thing that stood out about that trip for me, it was how effortlessly the mushrooms could bounce me from extreme ends of the emotional spectrum.  That night was both terrifying and terrific, pure hell and pure joy...as with everything, a paradox.

425	0	a	I really enjoyed the Zapotecorum mushrooms the last time I tried them, so of course I decided to try them again. The last time, I consumed a little over 2 grams, giving me one of the best mushroom rides I'd had in a long time. This time, I set out to do the same, consuming a little over two grams.....
426	0	a	Shortly after, as they were 'kicking in', I felt the need to go farther.  It became a battle....against the mushroom.  Just how can one consume this many mushrooms.  In all, my partner and I consumed about 16 grams of the Zapotecorum mushrooms together.
427	0	a	Rather quickly, time became irrelevant. The ups are hot, I sweat.  The downs are cold, I shiver. I feel the euphoria take over me.  It is hard to handle the feeling, it is so powerful. I feel the euphoria take over me.  It is hard to handle the feeling, it is so powerful. Tracers, morphing, geometric patterns break away into a trance-like state.  I am able to see whatever I want to see. I begin to have visions of Aztek rituals.  I see why they eat the sacred mushroom, it is simply to feel the love of God, and to feel closer to him.  The Aztek shaman I am conversing with asks me to come with him. We leave the festival, and walk into the wilderness. The shaman leaves me, I don't know where he has gone. I see more primitive people.  They are just like us. They do not wear clothing. They too, are consuming the mushrooms. 
428	0	a	The scene seems to play in reverse, although it feels just fine.  I see even more primitive primates.  They are unable to verbally communicate, a mere animal.  I see them consume the mushroom.  The mushroom stimulates them, it gives them ideas.  It teaches them to talk.  It teaches them to love one another.  I feel now, that what gave humans intelligence was the psychedelic experience. At this point, I feel so awestruck, I realize that I am receiving this information from no other than God.  God is not a person, a thing, a place.  God is every person, everything, every bit of this existence that we know. I feel Gods love.  I love him back.  I thank him for his wisdom, we embrace each other for a lengthy period of time.  He shows me heaven, and it is wonderful.  He sends me on my way back, in a different path.
429	0	a	I see now a beautiful scene.  Aliens are here on earth, although they are not so alien.  They are us, we are them.  They love us, and we love them.  We share the sacred mushroom together.  I see primitive men collecting mushrooms.  I see them consuming them.  I see primitive men growing mushrooms in the wilderness, providing them with food, water, performing rituals to worship them.  They truly are a gift from God to these people, and to myself.
430	0	a	I now find myself in a more modern time.  The development of the modern church.  The large masses of humans around has instill fear, anger, and greed into the human soul.  The teachings of God are remembered, but it is forgotten who he is.  The religious leaders proclaim that the mushroom is not to be eaten, it is forbidden. The church has convinced the masses as to their warped perception of God, heaven, hell, what is right or wrong.  They work together with royalty to demand riches from the masses.  But some still remember the sacrament given to us.
431	0	a	A small  group of simple, loving people is consuming mushrooms, laying in the woods.  There are two families, both have children.  A few men come upon the group, they are laughing, and enjoying themselves thoroughly.  The men do not understand what is happening.  They approach, and see the mushrooms.  They see the group is nearly delirious with enjoyment. A situation arises, the parents defend their childrens lives with their own. The children run.
432	0	a	A scene approaches, two of the children are older.  A boy and a girl, trying desperately to live through the winter.  The girl is pregnant.  The boy works for farmers to be able to stay warm through the winter in their barn. They have their child.  They teach him as they were taught, simply to love each other, and treat each other with kindness, as though every person was part of their own family. They use the mushrooms to gain enlightenment on a regular basis.  The child becomes very wise, learning how to portray his knowledge to others in a way they can understand. The church does not approve of his following.  They kill him publicly. His teachings are so effective that his story is told for thousands of years.
433	0	a	I return to the Aztek ritual.  We are on a megalithic structure.  There are thousands of people dancing, chanting, burning fires.  I join them.  Much time passes.  The ritual fades slowly away back to a euphoric feeling. The mushrooms grow from my stomach, wrapping me in strands of their loving mycelium. The mycelium growing from me extends outward, colonizing the world. I feel connected to everything.  I feel I have access to all the knowledge of the world.
434	0	a	I slowly come back to a near reality.  I hear sounds in the room, they don't sound good. I open my eyes to see my partner purging into her safety bucket, she is feeling rough. I rush to care for her, fresh water, fresh shirt, and a cleaning of the bucket.  There are so many swelled mushrooms in that bucket.  The cats run frantically about the bathroom, sure I am insane.
435	0	a	Her needs are tended.  I feel relieved that she is feeling well again, and returning to her experience. I head outside, taking my puppy with me.  It is -15*F outside.  It is the most beautiful snow I have ever seen.  It is fresh, it snowed about an inch overnight. The dog is very concerned   Seems to think there is something with me.  She runs frantically around the house. I bring her to her kennel, so we can have some peace.  She is just a puppy, I love her so much.
436	0	a	I take a couple shots of tequila, 1800 Reservado.  I feel the sweet fermented nectar of the agave fruit absorb into my body, it feels great.
437	0	a	I move to the bedroom.  I have extreme visuals.  Much of the landscape is covered with this pattern.....indescribable. My lover and I contemplate the night/morning, the problems of the world. We turn on some Futurama.  The beginning is intense.  It is short, and just about killed me with amusement. The episode is Benders Game.  
438	0	a	Things slowly calm down.  My partner slowly drifts off.  I smoke cannabis for a couple hours. I finally feel calm enough to rest at about the 13 hour mark. I finally feel calm enough to rest at about the 13 hour mark. The rest lasts about 4 hours. I awake to feel refreshed.  I care for everything around me.  I come to the forums to tell of my experience. I feel like I did not do justice to the awesomeness of this experience.  I could write a novel about this experience.

444	0	a	I then went back to my class and waited for my trip to come on. I first felt it coming on about 45 mins after I consumed them. They hit me in full force right as the bell rang and as I stood up to leave the classroom. The trip was pretty weak at this point because I had quite a tolerance built up from the weeks prior. This was a good thing cause I would not like to be trippin hard in school.  I had no visuals due to my tolerance.
445	0	a	My friend gave me a ride to my other friend tÂs house. In the car there was some funk on witch I could really groove to. When we arrived at tÂs house we smoked a couple onies of some Afghani bud he had picked up in school that day. Cannabis always makes my trip run smoother, it takes the edge off. At this point I consumed another quarter of shrooms with a hot pocket.(approximately 2 hours after I ate the last eighth) We then went for a walk in the rain. The rain felt super intense on my back, almost like a massage. Me and ÂtÂ beat boxed as we walked it was a super fun thing to do when your trippen. After a while we came upon a creek and just as this happened the rain stopped immediately and the sun poked through the clouds. My trip exploded it felt like the entire quarter just hit me all at once. A tingly sensation vibrated through my body. With each second it grew more and more intense. Every time I breathed in I could feel the oxygen going in to my lungs this increased the tingling sensation times 2.  All of a sudden the entire tree line started flying in and out coming at me then receding. ENTIRE trees were moving and swirling around me. This also increased the tingling feeling I was forced to sit down. I looked over a ÂtÂ and his shirt just shattered in to tiny little squares and then sucked back together again. There was one thought stuck in my head (nothing matters). At this moment I cared about nothing else in the world. Things I was typically self conscious about just vanished, I just didnÂt give a shit about anything, all the pressures of life were lifted from my shoulders. I had the courage to say anything to anyone I wanted and I wouldnÂt even care what they thought because I was having such a good time and nothing could kill it. I hitch hiked to my other friend mÂs house and met many interesting people an the way, I had a great time.
446	0	a	That night aprox.10 hours later I ate my final eighth and didnÂt even trip due to my tolerance. This is when I realized I needed to cut down on my shrooming even though it is the funnest thing in the world.

449	0	a	It all started out when me an my best friend (Lets call him E) got the idea to eat some mushies. E had tried them before and said that he felt like a god. So naturally I was compelled to try them too. After alot of contemplating about what could go wrong, what I shouldnt eat, should eat, what to think about, and what not to think about. I have been preparing for this for like three days not doing anything that would get me depressed during the trip. He ate an eight and I ate a sixteenth.
450	0	a	We got up early (10:00) on that day and he came over to my house. We ate nothing beforehand so the mushies'll effect us faster. I got some lemonade to wash them down with. (citric acid supposedly speeds things up) We toasted our mushies and ate em like theres no tomorrow (12:00). Personally, the damn things didnt tase so bad...
451	0	a	Oh well anyway, It was a really nice day outside so we decided to go walk around. E was complaining about how long these are taking to work. We usually like walking around alot but once they hit they really hit. We were like rocks..barely making it to my front door. Whenever I do when I get into my house is put on some trance on my computer and just relax. We were just sitting down on the couch listening to some good trance once they blasted us. They effected E before me but since it was my first time I was totally gone. Since trance always makes me happy I just blasted it and waited.
452	0	a	My walls were pulsating in and out. I tried to stand to get a drink but I felt like jello and fell on my face cracking up. The good thing is that I felt so damn good that I didn't feel pain. I couldn't stop dancing either. My world was now a washing machine spinning in flashy colorful circles. I wasn't expecting to be that blasted but I was wrong. I barely remember what I saw I just know I saw things. I fell into my coat closet and just stayed there so comfortable and just closed my eyes. My musics still going so I was in heaven. I was seeing a whole 3-d neon story unfolding right before my very eyes..in total darkness! Then one of my other friends (lets call him T) came over just to see how we were doing...T walked into me laughing nonstop and E wrapped up in his shirt in a ball like a baby just happily tripping. T and I smoked a joint alil bit after that. By that time E and I were just past the point of making sense. After T left, B came over to check up on us too. Nothing eventful happened while B was here. I was laying on the floor on my carpet just watching it dance and change. E was laying down trying to understand everything.. Why this Why that. It was about 3:30 now and I was still in space. E and B left my house at the same time and I was there alone listening to trance. Thank god I was on my come-down by that point because I wouldnt want to trip alone. Thats about it.
453	0	a	All in all, once you have done the proper preparations in order to have a good trip, trip-away indeed. I felt amazing all over that whole time just listening to music with E my best friend.I had a really good time. And yes I plan on doing it again.

455	0	a	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : General (1), First Times (2), Small Group (2-9) (17)
456	0	a	My very first time doing shrooms was on a bus to Baltimore.  I had 3g of shrooms in my bag, and we decided to just see what it was like.  So we each kept popping little bits of it.  It felt like smoking very good weed; nice, mellow, total-body high.  Very cool.  I remember feeling very relaxed and introspective, and seeing mild hallucinations, mostly involving blurring of color and light.  I liked the experience, and decided the next time I did shrooms, instead of taking around 1.5grams, which my experienced friends suggested, that I'd take an entire 1/8th bag.  And I did.  I blended in with orange juice, and around 45min. later I was tripping.
457	0	a	At first it was a great trip.  I was seeing crazy stuff, sounds were exaggerated, I heard silly music, and everything was swirling and changing colors.  What I didn't know was that this was only a stage in the high, and that many more intense stages were on the way.  Doing shrooms was kind of like getting more and more high in increments, and having to adapt to each new stage.  
458	0	a	By the third stage of my high, although I was really enjoying the hallucinations, I started having a bad head trip.  I felt terrified for now reason at all, and very very depressed about the most minute insecurities I have about myself.  And my emotions were changing rapidly...one minute I'd be cracking up, the next minute crying (literally).  Then things got too trippy for me to handle, probably only because I had no experience with this drug before.  I was with a friend (who was totally sober), and every time I said something I was totally convinced that I was speaking in my friends' voice.  It sounded exactly the same to me.  Then I looked at him, and because convinced that I was looking in a mirror, and that I was identical to him.  I kept shouting at him to tell me who I am, what my name was, that I was my own being.  He thought it was amusing, so he played along.  Then I remember playing a video game, in a different part of my house, and thinking to myself, 'wait, did all that just happen?  Or did I imagine the entire thing?  Wasn't I just in that other room?'  Nothing made sense at all, and this kind of total loss of rationality through me into a panic.  I was very scared of being on my own, of not knowing what was real anymore.  My friend quickly talked me out of it, and the rest of the time was mostly enjoyable.  Next time I'll probably do around 2grams, and see if that's a little more under control.
459	0	a	I learned that setting is very important on mushrooms.  In case I went nuts, I was happy to have someone present to babysit and help me be comfortable.  Taking so much my first time was too much tripping too fast, and it freaked me out.

462	0	a	This experience happened to me almost a year ago today, I was just reminiscing and decided to share it with my fellow psyconaughts.  It was one of those spitfire trips.  You know the kind, 'Hey man I got some real good shrooms wanna trip with me?'  'Shure I've got nothing to do.' This was one of those.
463	0	a	My buddy J. gave me an eighth for $15 dollars.  I ended up giving some away to another friend who just wanted a slight taste of shrooming; I probably gave him around a quarter of the bag.
464	0	a	Anyway J and I took our beautiful fungus with some Peanut Butter, which was very good. We sat in my basement and waited.
465	0	a	(T+0:30) I start to feel that goofy yet growing intensity of a psychedelic experience.  
466	0	a	(T+1:00) I'm begging my journey.  The floor and the wall begin to alter their molecular form.  They became fabric held up by the strings of time.  I feel the loss of control in my psyche that I find soothingly chaotic.  
467	0	a	(T+1:30) I close my eyes and my mind begins to extend it's existence.  My thoughts leave my body and become vapors in the air, floating through time and memories.  The colors in my eyes became so complex that they told a story in themselves.  A purple-cloaked wizard stands on a cliff (a lot like the cover of Led Zeppelin IV but smoother and violet).  Vortexes and spirals are born from one another morphing and melting to bring about new forms, IÂm lost in the world of my mind. 
468	0	a	(T+2:00) I try to watch a bit of TV to grab onto reality, which was sneaking away from me, but it didn't help.  I loose my concentration and the people on the television begin speaking like a severely warped LP.  I can't control my thoughts, fear creeps over me.  There's ominous music in the air.  IÂm lost in the darkness.  Am I going to leave this place, or am I locked in?  Did I offend God?  Help me! Let me out! PLEASE!
469	0	a	(T+3:00) I decide to turn on some music to sooth my soul.  I choose some classical to guide my journey.  I put in Moonlight Sonata and collapse, overwhelmed with myself.  I close my eyes to see what I hear.  The colors directly reflect the music.  The violets pulse with the heartbeat of the music.  The dark reds blast around the melody with deep blues extending beyond my reach.  All painted on a black background of an unknown void.  My thoughts calm as I become lost in this beauty.
470	0	a	(T+4:00) The trip starts to wind down.  The fear is gone, and the glimpse into ultimate reality begins to end.  I cannot help but wish to travel again.  The fear took hold and the trip was scarred by my ego.
471	0	a	This was one of my favorite trips and I will always remember it.  I was extremely scared at one point, but this only reminds me of how much we donÂt know, and how much there is to explore.

474	0	a	This would be the first time I experience mushrooms, IÂm 15 and one day I got some shrooms from a friend and he gave me the BIG mushroom about the size of your whole hand he found plus a few small ones and he said eat them all.. He never mentioned how long for it to take affect IÂm used to weed or that one's chest gets heavy when the effects are coming on. 
475	0	a	So one night my bro and I stayed up and I ate the big one and 2 small ones and he just ate 2 small ones. So we waited for the effects for about 25 minutes and we were thinking nothing was going to happen so we waited more and about 45 minutes after we ate them my chest started getting heavy and it was hard for me to breathe. For some reason I still wasnÂt worried and itÂs a good thing or else I would have had a bad trip.
476	0	a	My body started feeling kinda heavy but relaxing and felt good. We were only in my small bedroom with a cd player. We were laughing at the stupidest things, I took a bunch of pictures with my phone and if they were pictures with our faces our pupils were huge and we had a wide smile, we looked like aliens. Time felt like forever, 5 minutes felt like an hour which was kinda nice.
477	0	a	We put on music that I planned to put on then we changed our mind and ended up listening to the northstar singers Christmas carols 3 times. Then I stopped for a while and looked at a poster of a girl in a bikini on my wall, it was moving and bending bigger and smaller and was tripping me out. I closed my eyes and saw brilliant colorful changing visuals and thought, I feel like a druggie but this is fuckin awesome while my bro was freaking out about Âthe raccoon that was gunna bite him.Â
478	0	a	Then everything stopped. The feeling, the visuals, the laughing. I told my bro to go to sleep and I went to bed too. I laid my head down and I guess the visuals werenÂt all gone there was color underneath my eyelids.
479	0	a	I woke up in the morning with a minor headache, no nausea but, I know I had the biggest fart I ever had in my life. If I was going to bed drinking the hangover would have been a lot worse, but I still didnÂt feel all the way there inside my head the next day.

482	0	a	I ate mushrooms while visiting a friend in the fall.  My mental vocabulary comes from too much thinking, marijuana (often), previous mushroom experiences, salvia, ecstasy.  I have the most experience with marijuana and mushrooms.
483	0	a	This was an interesting trip for me.  I've always taken small doses - 2g was on the larger side.  It was sunset.  We walked up on a hill by some houses to watch as we ate our doses.  Although it looked as though we were well away from the houses, someone came out and helpfully informed us that we were on private property.  I've always hated angering people, even when I believe I haven't harmed them.  This conflict in my mind between the beautiful land, which gives itself freely to all, and anger in the mind of my fellow man stuck with me.  I've been hoping to let go of my control, though, so I proceeded with that in mind.  We left and walked west, and followed the sun!  It was a beautiful time, and though it was a very cold day, we struck out happy.
484	0	a	This was pretty spontaneous.  I've always felt much happier planning out my trips.  I like to make sure I'll be in a place where I won't hurt myself or have any reason to talk to law enforcement.  (I think cops are doing important jobs.  I don't think of what I do as a crime - so it would be a shame to waste resources like that.  Also, bad vibes, me being scared shitless, etc.  Just would rather not.)  The setting we were in was rural/suburban - we walked on a busy main road, populated with houses on either side.  I was looking for a field or a park to relax and be comfortable in.  As we walked on, I felt familiar vibrations in my limbs, and a change in my vision - more contrast, slightly brighter, slightly blurrier.
485	0	a	We reached a point where I could feel I was about to peak.  We could see a field beyond a row of trees.  I was losing my hold on everyday distinctions, but I was pretty sure we'd be on someone's property.  A car pulled into a driveway behind us, and we pushed through the trees, not wanting to be seen.
486	0	a	The trees were like a boundary line.  Once beyond, the dry grass flew outward in beautiful geometry.  I love the visual component of mushrooms.  The whitish grass was gorgeous on the raw dirt, under a purple sky.   I love the visual component of mushrooms.  The whitish grass was gorgeous on the raw dirt, under a purple sky.  We walked a bit, and I fell to my knees.  My intense appreciation for my surroundings clashed continually with my ideas about angry people owning the land we were on.  After letting this roil around for a few minutes, I asked my friend if we could return to his house.  We walked the long way back as my body began to disassociate a bit.  It wasn't hard to walk, it just felt a bit like I was a puppet.  I was very sleepy, or I wasn't, but I yawned deep, deep yawns.  They seemed to begin and end beyond my body's capability to yawn.
487	0	a	When we got back, I felt a small miracle!  It was good to be back in safe territory.  I was glad I hadn't had to confront anyone about trespassing.  I felt very drunk - we collapsed in plastic chairs and relaxed for a while.  We went in the house and spent some time in the dark, which was beautiful.  I decided to take a bath.  I turned on the hot water.  The lights haloed in rainbows.  I was coming down, but still had a ways to go.  I stepped into the tub and crouched down.
488	0	a	That moment was when something clicked for me.  I smelled my body odor, fresh from our long walk.  I smelled the faint odor of my shit.  I was crouched in a fetal position, lightly holding my knees.  I felt newness, fear, overwhelmed by colors, smells, sounds.  I was wet.  I realized then that we are born into every moment.  The music that makes up the vibrations of our atoms swells us into existence in every breath.  I will always be confused, and afraid, and joyful, and new.
489	0	a	The rest of the trip was pleasant and unremarkable.  I learned a lot (and relearned some things).  I have been waiting for an opportunity to take a higher dose (probably on the order of 3.5g).

492	0	a	Before the experience started I asked God to experience something to help me on my spiritual path. I hung out with some friends and took one and a half mushrooms. About a half hour into it, we decided to go to the beach a few miles away. I found myself at the beach. The rainbow sunset was the perfect setting and I remember having an overall sense that everything was beautiful and perfect. I was happy and at peace. On the way back to my friend's house it felt as if time was moving at an incredibly slow pace. It was as if the ten minute drive was taking a half an hour, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and wasn't impatient at all. 
493	0	a	Back at the house, we started watching a downloaded television show and part of the way through I started thinking that I was watching another world on the screen, like I was actually watching aliens living on another planet or in another place. I imagined that was how planets watched each other and learned about each other's lives. It was very real for me and strange to think about now. 
494	0	a	The next thing I remember is that I heard a voice in my mind telling me that I needed to work on my laziness. I heard a voice in my mind telling me that I needed to work on my laziness. A Father figure also asked me to forgive him for raping me. I still am not sure who this Father figure was, maybe a past life memory or something. But I do know that the first voice was Jesus Christ or Adonis as I now know Him to be also. About 6 months after the trip I started talking to him in my mind without being on shrooms. We talk everyday now all the time. I am also talking to Archangel Michael a little each day. 
495	0	a	I am grateful that the trip opened my mind up to new awareness. Sometimes a catalyst is helpful when we don't have enough faith that they [Jesus and angels] can communicate audibly.
496	0	a	Angels and upper dimensional guides are very helpful and I love them with all my heart. I hope you all can meet your upper family and get the help you need. Love you all.

499	0	a	I have been smoking marijuana for nearly a year now, and while I love it I've always been intrigued by other drugs, more specifically psychedelic drugs like mushrooms, LSD, etc. Unfortunately it is rather hard for me to come by things like this...they're a rather precious commodity where I live. However a friend of mine recently said he could get me some magic mushrooms, so I readily accepted. The cost was 30 dollars for an eighth which was expensive for me, but I went ahead an bought a quarter anyhow.
500	0	a	Last night I decided to trip for my first time despite the warnings I've received about bad trips, people being scared their first time, tripping alone, etc. Frankly I knew I would be ok. I broke up half of an eighth into really small pieces, and chewed and swallowed some by themselves, and washed pinches of the stuff down like pills with sprite. It took maybe fifteen minutes to get this done. I got in the shower and listened to some music for a while as I bathed. Not much happened for about half an hour, although I did notice some extremely small effects, such as pupil dilation and rounder doors.
501	0	a	I decided I would take the rest of the 1/8 (I didnt want to overdo it by taking too much at once for my first time) and make tea out of it. Next time I trip, I'm just going to use tea. Its not bad at all, and easier to get down than the raw, dried mushrooms. I broke up the remaining 1/16 ounce of mushrooms and put them in a metal tea ball, and put it in a cup with some honey and a bag of earl grey. Put in the nearly boiling water and let it sit for ten minutes and then sipped it slowly while watching 'the Wizard of Oz.'
502	0	a	Now is when things started to get good. At the part where Dorothy is being interrogated as to whether she is a good or bad witch, I seemed to know I was on to something. I left my room to use the bathroom, and while there I realized I was most definitely tripping. The whole concept of space bent a little bit, and it was hard to judge distances since things moved a little bit. Looking at the rows of brilliant lightbulbs over the mirror, I could see kaleidoscopic patterns in each. Looking in the mirror was more fun than anything else, though. I looked at myself and watched me turn into an old man, and then into a hairy, ogre-like thing. Finally I stared at my reflection long enough that I became nothing but a series of pastel and neon colors collected together in the shape of a man. The whole room took on this aspect for about a minute before it changed back.
503	0	a	For several hours I went back and forth between the bathroom, my bedroom, and the computer room (I spent a lot of time in the WC despite the fact that I didnt have to use it...the light and colors in there were great.)
504	0	a	I listened to some music on my headphones while lying in bed...various things, among them Donovan (who I usually dislike) and drew for a little while, which was pretty fun. Later I just layed in bed while I watched thin multicolored lines of light race around the walls in a fashion reminiscent somehow of a pinball machine or video arcade.
505	0	a	At one point I was lying in bed and felt completely sure that my arm was about a foot away from the rest of my body and completely separate. Slowly but surely I began coming down, and eventually went to sleep still high, but no longer tripping...
506	0	a	It was definitely worth the 30 dollars, I will definitely take more mushrooms in the future, and when I have an opportunity I will definitely order spores. This was far better than weed, and the idea of doing mushrooms in a group setting appeals to me immensely...I hope I can get a nice sized group sometime. Next time, though, I'm shrooming with my friend that got these for me. I hope its just as good :)

509	0	a	I hadn't done mushrooms in a very long time and a friend happened to know someone trustworthy that had some.  So we planned a camping trip, but ended up staying in the back yard. 
510	0	a	After taking 5 or 6 small caps and stems and eating them the effects came on slowly, over the course of 45 minutes.  I first noticed when we were blowing bubbles in the back yard and the colors were becoming blindingly bright, I could see the vibrations of the bubbles as they quivered in the air. Later I looked up at the stars and noticed they were made of 3 colors like a 3d movie, my friends were enjoying something in the house, but I didn't feel light and childish as I had before, instead I walked to the fire pit and sat, staring into the flames.  
511	0	a	I was overcome with sadness and the realization that this was a memory, and that I had seen this same fire, this same flame reflected in a copper fire ring, in another time.  I was watching it through different eyes, but the same because they had once been different windows to my soul. I watched the fire but did not feel comfort from its warmth, the reflection of the heat and light told me a story of when this had been a necessity, when I had been a slave to someone cruel, that I felt hopeless, with no future, no expectation of freedom or change.  I knew I would die, I knew this fire was someone elseÂs fire, that I had seen that reflection in burnished copper in another time, an ancient time.  A time when I had been a woman, and I had been property and not prized property, and the flames and the copper brought up a deep sadness and despair.  I acknowledged this memory, this feeling and I let it go, back to the stars, back to the fire and out of my memory.   
512	0	a	I went to my tent to meditate on this experience; it was deep and difficult, I was happy when the night was over, when it became the day again. Difficult but, so important.

515	0	a	I have been a regular weed smoker for over 5 years now and have been doing ecstacy twice-three times a month for over 3 years. 
516	0	a	The first time I ever ate mushrooms was a year ago when some of my friends had been eating some and they thought I'd eat some with them. I had eaten a relatively small amount compared to the 2nd time I did mushrooms. 
517	0	a	My first time was quite a hilarious experience for me (mexican shrooms), I felt like the world was really funny, people's faces seemed funny and at the same time weird, all their facial expressions seemed very clear as well as their behaviour, I was tripping on every single thing (the car stereo, talking to the trees, and many other funny shit), yet that only lasted for 3 hours or so.
518	0	a	Me and my friend A went to Amsterdam this summer and we thought we'd eat some shrooms over there, we went into a store and the guy selling them told us that a pack of mushrooms would give us a good trip. However, we thought we needed an intense trip (I still regret that till now), so we took 2 packs of Hawaiian mushrooms and decided to eat them next to the fountain in central Amsterdam. My friend A had never experienced shrooms before and this was his first experience. I remember the guy at the store told us to eat half of the pack first, wait for 30mins and then eat the other half. I thought I'd just eat the whole pack really fast and just get on with it. A ate the first half then went to buy some orange juice and came back within 30mins and ate the other half. 
519	0	a	I started to feel it kicking in, while we were sitting a dealer approached us and wanted to sell some X (dealers are everywhere in Amsterdam!). He was standing up and I saw his face make those strange movements which were quite fast, his ears started growing really big and his face looked really small compared to his ears, and I was sitting there and just laughing my ass off! A thought that we were overdoing it with the dude and that we should head to the hotel to grab our jackets...
520	0	a	As we were walking, the walls were making faces and I felt like I was in an absolutely wicked and interesting state of mind and felt that the world was just bright and beautiful. As we reached our room I started to feel really mashed so I thought we'd go and lie on our beds for a while, as I opened the door of our room, every single thing seemed to be moving in the room, it was hilarious! The lamp was just dancing and the pillows were all dotted and light in the room was so bright, A started repeating the word 'shrooms' the whole time and just laughing! He kept on telling me on how this is so fucking good! We were laughing our asses off for I dont know how long (It took us quite some time to figure the time). 
521	0	a	I decided to sit back and calm down from all the tripping and talking we were doing. Then suddenly I felt that my stomach was in deep pain and my whole body was so fucking numb (as if I had been drinking 10 shots of tequila). In a funny manner I decided to ask A whether I had taken too many shrooms cuz I'm feeling really fucked up, he answered me back by saying 'Don't worry man, everything's cool, dont feel paranoid or else you'll get into a bad trip'. The word 'bad trip' gave me a sense of fear and I felt that maybe I ate too many shrooms, I was thinking like: 'shit, what've I done, I've never felt like this before, I hope this ends as fast as possible'. I thought about dying on shrooms and how bad that would be. 
522	0	a	The pain started to increase and I was just drooling all over the floor and I wanted to kill the buzz I was having and just get back to real life. I wanted to kill the buzz I was having and just get back to real life. After I guess 5 hrs or so, I started to calm down a bit. A kept on telling me not to worry and that everything was ok its just a drug and we're going back to real life. I knew I had got into a bad trip and that I have to get out of it by any other way. I felt that the room was really small and uncomfortable, thats why I'm never going to do shrooms and sit indoors. Later on, I was starting to feel physically better; yet my brain was doing so much thinking and I was saying some weird stuff on how this world seems so strange, why are we here? I started to feel more connected to God and felt that he was really the most powerful.
523	0	a	That was my second time trying shrooms, my third time was 2 days after that day, were we did mexican ones in a park and everything was really funny, yet I was doing more thinking about god and how could such a mushroom do so much to your brain! As of having a bad experience the first time I decided to eat those ones really slow and at certain intervals of time. My second time wasn't as intense as the first time but it was definitely amazing. 
524	0	a	I think that after taking shrooms I can see the world in another perspective I think that after taking shrooms I can see the world in another perspective than what I always had, I can now see alot more clearly through things and especially through people, yet I sometimes get mild flashbacks, especially when I'm talking to people, I can see their faces make some strange expressions. Now I look at life in a more detailed way, is that a good thing or not? I always used to go with the flow with things and took life in a really lazy manner, now I feel that I have to be serious with things. Could that be a response from experiencing death (according to my first time, when I got into the bad trip I thought I could almost jump out of the window in order to stop the pain I was going through and just kill myself instead, I felt I was physically being tortured with my second time)?
525	0	a	Why did I get into a bad trip? Is this because I consumed alot?

527	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : Retrospective / Summary (11), Bad Trips (6), General (1), Various (28)
528	0	a	The first time I tried mushrooms, I was 17. It was spring break of that year, and I was staying with my best friend, whom I hadn't seen in two years. This was my first experience with any sort of drug except marijuana, and I was a bit nervous, but looking forward to it.
529	0	a	We started off the night with a mile or so walk to another friend's house, who ended up not being home. We smoked a bowl of weed, while waiting for our third party member to return, which fucked us up quite a bit, being that neither of us had smoked in at least a year. After deciding that she wasn't going to arrive, we walked back to my friend's house, sat around for a little bit, and when we started coming off the weed, it was suggested... 'you want to do those shrooms tonight?'
530	0	a	After deciding there was nothing better to do, we made a little bit of food to wash the shrooms down with, since they tasted horrible, then just sat around talking and waiting for it to kick in.
531	0	a	The ride up was just about what I was expecting, a bit of anticipation, with a generally happy feeling. If I could do this again, I wouldn't have taken the shrooms right when we were coming off the weed though, the tiredness from coming down definitely killed the shroom effects a bit, I think.
532	0	a	After about an hour, we were sitting around chilling out, listening to music, attempting to talk, and it was really kicking in. When I closed my eyes I would tend to completely space out with hallucinations. For a while (it seemed like an eternity, but it actually couldn't have been more than 10 minutes), I kept picturing myself in this game show, with a bunch of flashing lights, which was quite pleasant. By this time my friend and I couldn't talk very much, we just sat listening to the music, occaisionally talking a little, and both of us completely spacing out for a few minutes at a time.
533	0	a	We were listening to Hallucinogen's In Dub CD, which was perfect for the mood, very trippy, it felt like the bass was guiding me. We also drew in paint (on the computer) a bit.. my friend drew a face thing that tripped me out quite a bit, my drawing ended up as a toaster, for some reason.
534	0	a	We sat there spacing in and out for what seemed like forever, but it must've only been 60 minutes or so, since we listened to most of the CD. There was one song on the CD that had some laughing effects (the artist is a user of hallucinogens himself, so I'm sure that this part of the music was aimed to have this effect) that scared the hell out of both of us, but since we both looked at each other, completely frightened, at the same time, we were able to calm each other down, and after it faded, have a bit of a laugh over this.
535	0	a	Thus far, I was somewhat disappointed that I hadn't seen any actual hallucinations, just the closed eye visuals. One thing that I did notice when I had my eyes open, I would look at things, and I'd know what they were, and know they were familiar, but they would still look completely foreign and out of place. I would look at things, and I'd know what they were, and know they were familiar, but they would still look completely foreign and out of place. This latter effect lasted for a couple days actually, everything just seemed like it had something intricately different about it.
536	0	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
537	0	a	At this point we decided to drive over and see if our third friend had returned home yet.
538	0	a	Of course driving after taking mushrooms isn't the smartest idea... I hallucinated a stop sign in the middle of a 60 MPH highway, which proceeded to scare the living shit out of me; not because I knew it wasn't real, but actually the opposite. I rolled up, stopped, looked around for other cars, and my friend asked me what the fuck I was doing. I informed him there was a stop sign there, and he looked at me like I was insane, which I couldn't help but laugh at, and asked him what his problem was. His reply: 'Theres no stop sign dude, you're in the middle of the highway.' This totally blew my mind, I had to close my eyes for a minute, and when I opened them, sure enough, it was gone. I felt like I was driving about two miles per hour, everything was so distorted.
539	0	a	After what seemed like an hour (its a mile drive), we got to our destination, and found she still wasn't home, so we decided to smoke a little bit more weed, since the mushroom effects were tapering off (this was a couple hours after taking them.) After smoking, the effects of both the weed and the shrooms came back hard, my mind was completely buzzed and exhausted at once, we couldn't do much besides sit and trance in and out, talking a little bit too.
540	0	a	Eventually the exhaustion from the experience, and the come down, over came us, and we decided to lay down and try to sleep a bit, since we had a whole week of partying ahead of us. Laying down felt incredible, to just snuggle up in the bed with a blanket, but as soon as we turned off the light, I was wide awake. My companion confirmed that the same thing had happened to him. Rather than try to get up and find something to do, we layed in the dark enjoying the last of the effects, and reflecting about the experience, and life in general. Eventually we both fell asleep, but I ended up waking up every hour or so for the whole time that I was laying there.
541	0	a	We awoke mid afternoon the next day, still feeling a bit exhausted, altered, and generally fucking wonderful. 
542	0	a	I suppose overall the experience was pretty stereotypical as a positive medium dose mushroom trip, but I thought I would share, just because I enjoyed this so much.
543	0	a	There were no long term physical effects, and the only short term was a bit of exhaustion, and the inability to sleep the night after taking them.
544	0	a	Overall, this was one of the best experiences of my life, that left me with no repercussions, no addiction, and an incredible memory shared between friends.

546	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), First Times (2), Glowing Experiences (4), Music Discussion (22), Various (28)
547	0	a	Let me tell you a story about me and my first real magic-mushroom trip (I had taken them before a few times but received a small mushroom high and thats it). It all started with a friend of mine coming to my house with a bag of some left over mushrooms, the bag contained two and a half stems and a cap.I immediately ate these and chewed them into a fine mush and then swallowed them slowly. Earlier that day I had taken three morphine tablets and I had just come down from this.
548	0	a	As the first hour passed I noticed small auditory changes but nothing to intense after about another half an hour passed I thought this was as far as it was going to go. Half dissapointed I laid down on my bed and listened to some pink floyd at about the second song I start to fell this strong pressure that seemed to be concentrated on the back half of my body after a few minutes past this feeling got stronger and stronger. My stomach felt a little weird like the felling where I have taken some pain killers and I can feel it when they start to dissolve and absorb into my stomach.Then I sat up and zowee my whole body felt extremly light and odd I went over to the mirror looked in it and as I suspected my pupils were litarally as big as dimes. After I saw this it was confirmed I was trippen.
549	0	a	I went back to my bed and layed down and this is where the visuals started. I noticed that my ceiling was moveing and swirling.It was also bending out at me along with my closet like a little man was jumping on them.Then I noticed that there was a glare on my wall in this glare I saw a face not a scary or terrifying face just a face. I then stood up agine and my chair seemed to shrink before my eyes. As cool as these visuals were they werent even half the trip.The best part I think was the felling it this peceful almost orgasmic mentel felling I seemed to be at pece with everything around me. I started thinking these deep introspective thoughts and I finally confirmed what I always thought,that money and power really dont mean shit and that humans fuck everything in this world up and we still have the balls to outlaw gods creations it pissed me off frankly, or it would have pissed me off if I didnt fell so damn good. Well that is about as far as my trip goes the experience was incerdible and id like to thank god for putting these here they truly are magic-mushrooms.

551	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Unknown Context (20)
552	0	a	I tried to get a group of 3 people, including myself to go to the park and trip out, this was going to be my 4th time eating mush, but it turned out to be my 1st time at level 2, as the first 3 were level 1. I got to level 2 because I had an empty stomach, and I liked the visuals a heck of alot. I only managed to get 1 friend with me, so we set out to the park with a lake.
553	0	a	Me and my friend munched our shrooms and layed a blanket down. I layed down and listened to Infected Mushroom and similar trippy techno while the shrooms started. Since I didnt wear a watch, I dont know when they hit me, but I started to feel spaced out, then the clouds tripped me out. They looked different, and beautiful at the same time. The clouds would morph, and it would be like a kalidescope. They were thin clouds, not thick. I saw a dragon and other things in them, it was cool. This is when I knew I was coming on. I had sunglasses on, but the sky was not blue anylonger, it would turn shades of light purple too! Only later did I tell my friend, and he told me he saw the same thing, and thats what jimmy hendrix was talking about: Purple Haze!!!
554	0	a	I got a lil worried as my thoughts were getting different, and my 'me' feeling was dissapearing. There was no base feeling. I took a walk, and I couldent really think of anything too deep, as my memory and mind were unable to think of anything complex. I threw some pine cones at ducks and headed back to base camp. I layed back down and told my friend to take a walk and I would watch out stuff.
555	0	a	When he came back were chatting and I was talking random stuff. I was telling him how psilocybin works on the mind, that it removes the natural brain filter, so I can experience what its like to have this filter removed. And that my imagination is at play. I told him I felt like a painter, who could paint any image he imagined in the sky, and his paints were the clouds, and the sky was his paper.
556	0	a	We chatted more, and we were talking nonsense and laughing at what we were saying. I figured out that Carl's Jr. Uses a star as their logo because its like a star. They want to represent themselves as an Energy station. A star is hot, pure energy, and a round mass, much like a breast to an infant, who sucks on it to gain energy.
557	0	a	This and I could talk random stuff non-stop, the words flowed out of my mouth much easier than normal. I enjoyed the after glow, which I am still experiencing actually. We went and saw a movie, then I came home, and wrote this. All in all, I ate a 1/2 eighth, and the effects were: cloud morphing, cool vision, mild tracers, mild closed eye visuals that are connected to my imagination, thinking is altered, thinking is shallow and fast paced, or it can be deep and meaning full, empathy for friends and people. Joy, awe, and thankfullness for your gifts.

560	0	a	On halloween I was planning to get acid because I thought it would be cool from what I've read about it. But I was unable to obtain it, so instead I got mushrooms. I have only previously in my life done pot, ecstacy, coke and speed. These drugs were horibly boring and a waste to me (except ecstacy, that was cool). 
561	0	a	This was my first experience with any real halucinagen.
562	0	a	So I go into subway, buy a sub, put 5 units of shrooms on it. I walk around town a bit, about 15 minutes or so, stuff seems slightly more interesting at this point. My brother is a genius when it comes to drugs. At a school near my house the walls were really cheep and when you hit them they make this wierd 'Bloop' noise. My brother took me here and we were entertaining our selves for a good 20 minutes laughing uncontrollably. We proceeded to home, normally this short half hour walk went by quickly, but it seemed that it never ended, it felt like we must have been walking to home for at least an hour and a half. On our way we were laughing at some of the most stupidest things, I can't recall what, but they were there. After getting home we laid down in my room and stared at one of my posters, it began turning 'electronic'. Another 5 minutes it seemed went by, and my tv and speakers appeared to be moving as if possessed by demons, but I felt calm. It was at this point that silence was really cool for no reason at all.
563	0	a	Then my brother told me to put on the Issues album but Korn. I had a stack of about 40 cd's and when I picked them up they felt like they were melting in my hands. I tried to find the cd but was unable to, he had to find it. It is a wicked album to put on. So we shut of the lights and stared at some tiny lights about a cm in diametre of blue and red. I had hooked them up to my stereo as to light up when base accured. It was amazing.
564	0	a	It seemed as if half an hour had passed when track 2 had begun, at this point I had some major halucinations, first my room began stretching, second my room turned into what seemed to be a black universe covered in green lines (Like in that simpsons episode where Homer goes behind the book case and discovers the 3rd dimension). I was fascinated and having a fun time. Every single minutes went by amazing slow though. Time was at an all time slow for me. I was unable to sit within one spot for long, I tried moving around but it felt like my legs were melted into the floor, and had to walk on my knees. After about a half hour passed (in real time), the black universe within my room had been replaced with purple and pink symbols, somewhat like that scene in The Matrix where neo begins seeing everything as numbers. This was totally awesome
565	0	a	After another half hour had passed by, (real time) we put in a movie to watch (J and Silent Bob Strike Back), this was a terrible idea, all my fun crazy halucinations began to evaporate, for the rest of the night my only halucinations contained walls stretching or moving.
566	0	a	But all in all I had an awsome night. I will definatly be doing them again some time.
567	0	a	A wise note to my future self: Don't watch a movie, just watch your halucinations and see where your mind takes you.

570	0	a	My friend and I ran across some mushrooms, so we decided to buy a half an ounce. I have smoked weed daily for a little over a year and was interested in the 'real' psychedelics.  We identified the shrooms as Psilocybe Cubensis, because they were suprisingly very intact.
571	0	a	I spent five days preparing for the trip, (i.e. listening to calming japanese healing music, hendrix, simon and garfunkel.) cutting out all violence and negativity.  J, my friend has taken shrooms a couple of times and is quite interested in the world of mycology, so I felt everything was safe.
572	0	a	I consumed the mushrooms at 10:00 A.M. with no particular fowl tastes.  Everyone goes to these extreme measures to try and hide the taste, but I found it actually not bad at all, having eaten them in about 15 seconds.  We went out to his hot-tub, where mist arose because of the cool weather.  The enviornment felt mystical and perfect.  
573	0	a	T + 00:30 , no effects yet and suprisingly no stomach discomfort or irritability.  
574	0	a	T + 1:00 , walked up in the mountains and I start to notice fine details within the rocks, but nothing outrageous.
575	0	a	T + 2:00 , some mild hallucinations, but so subtle that they seem completely impulsive. Dresser slowly flowing towards me and small pattern movement in pillows and carpet/rugs.
576	0	a	T + 2:30 , body feels very uncomfortable, literally awkward feeling within my body. I keep pacing because everything I do feels uncomfortable and like I'm stuck between the void of sober and coming up.
577	0	a	T + 3:00 , We start to think they were fake, but they look and smell perfect.
578	0	a	Finally my internal body feelings ceased and I felt normal after about four hours and felt no substantial physical fatigue or aching.
579	0	a	J had to try them himself to prove if they were real or not, so he took 3.5 grams and had one of the biggest body high shroom trips he has ever had.  He mentioned that the visuals weren't as profound as any other trip, but his body was buzzing.
580	0	a	Very interesting that I recieved no effects yet my friend an experienced shroomer felt very hard full on effects.  Hopefully next time well get some better, more potent shrooms and try again.

582	0	a	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : General (1), First Times (2), Small Group (2-9) (17)
583	0	a	This report is about the first time (and only time to date) that I tried shrooms.  It starts off on a thursday morning.  My roommate had recently acquired 6 gelcaps and we were going to wait for the upcoming weekend to try them.  We are quite experienced with cannabis and alcohol but that is all that we had experienced before the mushrooms.
584	0	a	We were a little impatient because the weekend was taking forever to come, so at 12 noon on thursday, we take the pills.  2 each at first.  We stock up on food and take showers before the effects start to kick in.  I notice the effects within 30 minutes though my roommate doesn't report anything yet, just a little disorientation.  I look down at the carpet in my dormroom and notice a well-defined 'breathing'.  I was overjoyed that the batch of shrooms we acquired were not duds.  The white cement wall also starts to breathe and the clothes in the closet start to change color as the shadows cast on them start to move.  I was quite involved with all of this and spend what seemed like a lengthy amount of time staring at the liveliness of our normally plain dormroom.
585	0	a	We finally decide to go outside and walk around.  We go to a nature trail that runs across campus.  I am overwhelmed by the beauty of the trees and awe-struck with their seemingly timeless strength and size.  I now consider myself to be tripping, even though my roommate still claims to feel nothing.
586	0	a	We decide it's time to smoke some of the greens so we pack in a few bowls and smoke up.  This enhances the effect nicely for me and finally my roommate says that he feels some effects that cannabis alone can't produce.  It is around this time that my roommate takes the remaining 2 caps to try to achieve the level that I was experiencing.
587	0	a	We head back into the dorms and decide to sit in our kitchen, which has a beautiful view of the entire campus thanks to huge floor to ceiling window and a couch right in front of it.  I am still tripping nicely and my roommate starts to experience the beauty of mushrooms, probably assisted by the MJ.  We sit and look at the scenery melt and transform for the next 3 hours, never leaving that couch for anything.  I notice the clouds seem to take the form of huge faces that are trying to swoop down and swallow me right from off that couch.  I am overwhelmed by this sensation and close my eyes for a few seconds.  It is at this time that I discover some amazing CEVs.  The most intricate of patterns could instantly be displayed on the back of my eyelids.  The most interesting thing that occurred at this time was when it felt like the entire campus was just an extension of my body, and all the people within it were merely 'cells' traveling to my different organs.  We continue to sit in front of that window until we notice a slight come down.  
588	0	a	All in all this was a beautiful first shroom experience, though I'd like to have taken an extra cap just to enhance it that much more.  It was completely in control and somewhat enlightening.  I will try it again sometime and try to spend some more time outdoors, probably in the spring.

591	0	a	This was my second experience with mushrooms and boy was it overwhelming.  The first time I ate less than a half and eighth and only had mild effects.  Mostly lighting changes and shifty movements.  Anyway,  prior to the experience (the day before, tripped friday, so this is thursday), My friend and I spent the whole day driving around doing various things, shopping to going to the movies. The movie that we saw, was 'waking life'  this movie is nuts. Basically what it comes down to is the main character cannot tell the difference between his waking life and his dream life. He's stuck in a dream and cannot escape. This movie played a major role during the course of my trip.
592	0	a	Me and four other friends, ate the mushrooms around 7:30 and then around 8:00, they took it's first effects.  We decided to venture outside and head towards the videostore, a mere 8-10 blocks away. It was totally frigid out side, around 30 degrees, so we bundle up, about three layers and head for the store.  So far things and going pretty well.  We're walking and talking, when we get to the video store and as soon as I cross the threshold, I'm catapulted into an explosion of light and color.  The videos are rumbling and seem a bit shifty. We rent 'the big lebowski'.  My friend is cashing out and I'm busy staring at the floor and it's swirling spinning. We venture out in the frigid cold and head back to my house. The walk home was interesting, every 5 mins, someone would honk are yell at us from cars.  Some people seem to have nothing better to do.
593	0	a	After many conversations about the cruelty of some people, make it back to my house. The four of us head into my basement.  Meanwhile my parents are up stairs oblivious to wants occurring. We pop in the movie, turn on the black light and get comfortable. I'm curled up in a nice comforter on the futon.  So the movie gets going and then I'm in the middle of the trip.  I start having crazy visuals (due the blacklight and the black light sensitive paint splattered across the walls and ceilings of my basement.
594	0	a	Eventually, I tune out my friends and the movie and begin to recall the movie from the night before.  I start pondering whether or not I'm in a perpetual dream.  I'm debating in my head whether I'm dead or alive.  After many thoughts I begin to rule that I'm caught in a dream and nothing is real.  I'm beginning to freak out. I'm disconnected from reality and all that surrounds me.  Meanwhile my friends are talking about god knows what and all I can think about is that I'm sitting here caought in this never-ending dream from which I will never wake up from.  I begin to give thoughts of love to my parents and loved ones.  Eventually I begin to regain control of my thoughts and become aware that in fact I'm alive and in control.  It took my the longest time to convince myself that I was just on mushrooms and eventually these thoughts will dissapate.  Soon I came back to the real and was happy to find everything in tact. The time is between 1-2 that I finally drift away from the trip and return to baseline.
595	0	a	After this experience I've had seconds thoughts about drugs in general, particularlly strong psychedelics.  I have planned to stay away from them for a very long time, even marijuana for a while. This was just to overwhelming.  I guess I should have followed the guy's disclaimer before eating an 1/8:  'I don't recommended eating an entire 1/8th.  These will rock your world'

598	0	a	Shrooms are a crazy drug, but when combined with weed can be extremely crazy.  I had done shrooms before this, and it was fun, so me and 2 friends G and P decided to shroom again
599	0	a	Before we digested the shrooms straight out of the bag with a little help from water and juice, me and G smoked a bowl each so we were feeling relatively stoned.  Weed also helps the shrooms kick in faster.  
600	0	a	Shrooms usually take about 30-45 minutes to kick it, and when they do the body high comes in. Everything is funny, you feel light, giddy, humorous, extreme energy, happyness, etc.  However, this time because I smoked weed, this stage was bypassed completely.  After 30 minutes me and my friends walked to the park near our house.  As we hiked down to this spot we had previously decided to trip at, I noticed my vision getting very starry, blinking lights were everywhere.  We got to the spot and sat down, all of a sudden I could not understand a work my friends were saying.  It sounded like I was hearing the english language for the first time.  I looked at the scenery in front of me but I couldnt even comprehend what it was.  Everything had turned chrome, even the trees,  Everything was extremely bright and I could barely focus on anything.  The hill in the distance had turned into a dinosaur shape, the sky was completely silver, the foilage all around me was completely chrome and silver.  Objects such as my cigerrete butt had taken on life.  THe cigerette wrapper was having sex with the cigerette filter.  THe smoke coming off my friends cigerettes looked like jet fighters.  This is the intense hallucination stage one might experiance from shrooms.  It will probably last about an hour or so, then the hallucinations and trip will begin to wear down.  
601	0	a	After an hour, we left the park to go smoke a blunt, I was feeling pretty good.  The intense hallucinations were gone, replaced by milder hallucinations such as ground patterns and walls breathing when focused on.  The giddyness feeling was still there.  I was able to understand english again.  However, after we smoked the blunt my friend P started to really trip.  Marijuana intensifies ANY drug I take alot!!!  The marijana propelled him into a state of complete 'what the hell is going on'.  He crazily stumbled around the room and halls of his apartment bullding that we were staying at.  He must have said 'what the f*ck' at least 100 times.  At least me and G were their to help him calm down, which you should always do on shrooms. This is at about 3 hours into our shroom trip.  I was already mildly coming down, I could still see patterns on the ground, and people looked really weird
602	0	a	At about 4 hours I was still seeing patterns, especially of this figure of my dad pointing his finger disciplining me, which I found really weird, as if this pattern is trying to warn me that I am trapped by my parents or something
603	0	a	At about 5 hours most effects were gone, I could only see patterns if I focused really hard on stuff, at about 6 hours almost all effects were gone
604	0	a	Some basic things I try to follow when shrooming
605	0	a	3. If I'm are having a bag trip, just think to myself at all times 'this will be over in a few hours, I'm just tripping, what is happening in my brain IS NOT happening in reality'  This really helps me when I trip bad on shrooms
606	0	a	4. Try and remember some shit to think to myself when shrooming...sometimes I want bring a peice of paper and try (if I can) and write down the stuff I think.  I can be in a deep though process in which I can have revelations about life, relationships, etc.

609	0	a	Wow. Saturday night I had an old friend over from out of town ('R'). She had some X, I bought some shrooms and about $30 worth of weed. I usually eat 2 little shroom chocolates, but I shared with my roommate 'D' so I only had 1 that night, 'D' had one, and 'R' had 2 pills of x . I was worried I wasn't going to trip that hard.
610	0	a	No worries. What a beautiful night. We started out at about 11pm, smoking and just watching TV. Eventually, I went into my bathroom alone with a candle and just started meditating. I watched the candle explode into a flower with infinite rainbow petals. I closed my eyes and watched the flower become impossibly intricate. I started thinking about how words and numbers and even colors in the real world really fail to explain all the things we want to explain. I started thinking about how everything is just an excuse, an inadequate explanation for what we really want to do/feel/see. I felt reality fall out from underneath me...just crumble in a spiral under me. I followed the sprial down and around and suddenly...there it was.
611	0	a	It was like I came face to face with god. Or at least...god as I know it now. In my brain, there was no god. We are all god. And our collective conscience makes up the world we live in, the human being, the afterlife. I had experienced death and lived, only to not be able to put it into words.
612	0	a	It was too much. I screamed and moaned and cried and laughed for a good 5 minutes...it was like joy and life were just exploding out of me. My fellow trip-mates were worried at first, but after seeing the look on my face and hearing about my experience...lol, they knew there was nothing to worry about.
613	0	a	'R' had a similar experience once before and her and I spend a good hour talking about what 'it' was all about. I spent the rest of the night talking and dancing to any music I could find. 'D' was talking to the mirror for a good while and eventually asked me if I had a copy of alice in wonderland, he wanted to read about the jabberwocky! We were all really comfy and happy and took lots of pictures and went out in the snow once or twice.
614	0	a	About 4am, another friend came over and we smoked out. Around 5am, I took a shower (which felt amazing). We finally fell asleep around 7.  I felt great the next day...a bit tired and RAVENOUS (I ate almost 3 plates at Ponderosda).  Even up to a week later, I was still caught up in the afterglow of my experience.

617	0	a	Throughout the course of this year I've triped about 4 times on the divine food of the gods, magic mushrooms, but my first trip was by far the best.
618	0	a	I bought the shrooms at school the day I took them, I wasn't planning to take them until that weekend, so you could say I was unprepared, but educated, because I had been reading everything I could find about them, I had my friend 'N' come over to keep an eye on me so I didn't do anything stupid, I only meant to eat one gram but before I knew it they were all gone and I had eaten both grams.
619	0	a	I didn't feel anything for about 45 minutes (me and N were begining to think perhaps they weren't the right kind of mushrooms, but at that 45 minute mark they came on strong, I took a walk in my back yard and I was starring at the the large tree in my neighbor's yard for what seemed like hours and it actually bent over and shook my hand, this freaked me out and I ran back in the house, I figured I was outside for hours so I thought the trip was almost over and I was really disapointed, but when N informed me it had only been 15 minutes I was excited cuz I knew it had just begun. I, for some reason thawt is beyond me found Opera Whinfrey (spelling?) very amusing but while watching half of her face melted off and sorta like in terminator 2 there was metal underneath (she was a robot)  
620	0	a	N had to leave and I was all alone, thats when the really deep philsophical thinking started, I felt like I had the universe figured out in my head but when I tried to put it into words nothing made sense, needless to say this frustrated me and got me very upset, I went to get somthing to eat, but on the way to the kitchen, somthing caught my eye, the fake tree in my living room was on fire!! I started to freak out but then I realised that the flame wasn't consuming the plant and when I touched it, it didn't burn my hand, thats when the tree started to talk to me, about my life, about the universe, about all the questions in my head that were frustrating me and then everything became so clear, not that I figured out the universe like my original goal was, but that it was clear in my head that I wasn't meant to understand the universe, and that certain things are meant to be a mystery and since the whole situation reminded me of Moses and the burning bush incident in the bible, I figured the voice was God himself and I realised that there is too much that can't be explained and too much beauty and too many questions with no answers in the world for there not to be a God or heaven, and that heaven must be so wonderful because there is where you'll get all the answers to your questions, that experience brought me to beleive in God again and ever since that trip I've beleived in God and 'most' of my religion and my life has been better because of it.
621	0	a	I still trip on shrooms but never have I had a religious experience since my first time.

624	0	a	I have taken mushrooms seven or eight times and right from the first time I took them I experienced the same trip, it usually happens during the visually intense comedown and each time it is always a continuation of the last trip. The first 'episode' of this trip was on my first experience with mushrooms. It was in amsterdam with some friends. We got about 12grms of mexican mushrooms each and headed to a park. This was great fun and we just walked around in circles for hours laughing our asses off. I loved it. The sunshine made rainbows around everything I looked at and all the trees and flowers seemed to be laughing with us.
625	0	a	It was later, after we had found our way home that the real trip began. Everybody was very confused and tired after the comedown and we all had some joints and went to bed. I lay there for a while, still tripping like mad. Watching the curtains change shape and things like that. When I closed my eyes I stopped thinking. All thoughts were projected into my mind. I just lay there, taking it in. I could see myself rising high above the city and spears of light shot past me towards the earth. I was flying upwards at an amazing speed. Then all the spears of light faded and I slowed down. I was now hanging suspended in infinite darkness. Tiny lights began to apear everyhere around me. They were very much like stars in space but somehow I knew this was not space. Curling beams of light shot between each 'star'in the same kind of movements as a snake, except very fast. Something in my mind told me ehat all of this meant. I could somehow understand it all. The tiny lights were people and the snakes of light were the paths through life they take. The paths connected with other people and this is what made them seem to swim this way and that, they were influenced by the paths of everybody else. The image of this was enormous, I knew it went on forever. This was some kind of map of life. It made a web of lights as far as I could see. It is hard for me to remember all the thoughts that were appearing in my mind during all of this but I do remember being amazed by the profoundness of the thoughts and the fluidity with which they came to me. When I came back to the real world and found myself in my hotel room everything seemed so fake and trivial. It took me a couple of days to regain the feeling that the world we live in is reality.
626	0	a	My other experiences were with the irish liberty caps, of which I would take about 100 each time. The trip continued from before and this time I found the life path of me and some other people I know and followed it into the longterm future. I could not see incidents of the future but I knew who I would still be friends with, who would take a different path and I also got a glimpse of some of the more influential people I am to meet. I have no real expectations of any of this to come true but I would not be surprised if it does. I will go into more detail on all of this some other time. At the moment I am cultivating some mexican mushrooms in my home. They will be all ready in about a week and I look foreward to the next revelations of the map of life.

628	0	a	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : General (1), Retrospective / Summary (11), Mystical Experiences (9), Various (28)
629	0	a	It was new year's eve, me and my friend N went to my buddy M and his gf's little dirty appartment in toronto. So when we got there, M's like hey I'm giving you guys some shrooms. We were pretty happy cuz we didn't know about that. So I was ready to get real fucked and have a good time (which might've been a mistake cuz shrooms should be treated with respect and probably should be taken for a purpose, I dunno). It was a long time ago, so I don't remember the exact dosage. Well we didn't weigh it out, but we had about 2.5 to 3 g's each I'm pretty sure.
630	0	a	These were some fuckin potent shrooms. Kicked in real fast, and it was good at first, laughin my ass off the way shrooms usually make me do, started seein cool lookin geometric shapes on the walls that were always moving and changing. Usual patterns. We were watchin dumb and dumber and the people's noses, mouths, eyes and ears were sectioned off into squares and popping out. I was laughin at that for a while, but after a while it got a bit annoying for some reason. 
631	0	a	So my buddy N started to feel like he wanted to go outside for a smoke, either he was claustrophobic in the small place or it was too smokey in there, and we had a little conversation on whether or not we should go outside, but to me it felt like it lasted an eternity, and after what seemed like a while (but wasn't that long), the idea of being inside and being outside started to seem really really trippy to me for some reason (well shrooms). So when we went outside, there was this security dude walkin around, and we were talkin about how fucked we were, and for some reason that made me paranoid at the time and it didn't occur to me that hey it's new year's, of course we're fucked up, the security won't care. Then the security guy came and talked to N, and I couldn't understand what the hell anyone was sayin (the old 'bluhbumehengrenereh' sound that replaces people's words sometimes), so I got kinda worried we'd get searched. But it was all good. But that started makin the trip go downhill for me.
632	0	a	Anyway, back inside, and I reeally feel time slowin to a craawl, and eventually felt like I was trapped in time (this has never happened to me to that extent, so I was kinda scared at the time, but I'm sure that it's a normal thing that happens). The cool jagged snakey pattern things were pretty much takin over my whole field of vision and it made it hard to see, and when I closed my eyes it was nothing but totally different undescribable spinning patterns... So after a while of everyone actin kinda crazy the way shrooms make ya do, I got tired and laid down to try and sleep (which I shouldn't have done, come on I'm on shrooms and it's new years fuck), but sleep was impossible anyway.  
633	0	a	Here's the unusual part where my mind starts fuckin with me. So I'm lyin there and after a while of not knowing what's goin on and forgetting that period of time, I started hearing people outside who were yelling really violently (or maybe it was just the shrooms, I dunno, but it is toronto, always crap goin on), and to me the shrooms made it sound like it was the voices of my family members fuckin yellin at me like more pissed than I've ever heard them. I know I live far away from toronto, but I was convinced it was them cuz of the state I was in. Strangely enough, I got up, looked outside, and actually said 'I gotta go out there' (to deal with the yelling) and I was gonna do it but my friends told me not to. I started thinking I wasn't actually there where I was, that I had gotten too fucked and done something really really horrible and couldn't remember it. So lying down again, it felt like I could barely move at all it felt like I could barely move at all, I don't know if this is normal for shrooms. I was hearing car alarms and lotsa sirens from outside, and it made me think this horrible thing I thought I'd done involved me stealing a car and crashing it while killing people, being the reason why I'm on the ground and can't move and I'm hearin all these sirens and people freakin out. It was all in my head, it was nuts. These sounds were really amplified to me so it seemed like everything was goin on right around me. 
634	0	a	It was so weird how my mind was makin up these little realities that weren't real. I kept forgetting stuff that just happened, so it was hard to put the pieces together and remember it's just a weird trip. So I thought I was dying cuz I couldn't really move and that whole theory that I had been in a car crash, even though I never actually left the place, and was finding it hard to breathe, pretty scary in the mindset I was in, after a bit I felt like I was in a state of purgatory and peace and I was accepting the fact I was dead. (finding it hard to breathe and having a feeling of great peace are pretty normal for shrooms, but I didn't consider that at the time) But a bit later I dismissed the idea of being dead (cuz... I'm alive). But not the idea of being in the whole situation. 
635	0	a	Next thing I know, M's gf is talking to me, making sure I'm ok, and for some reason I just couldn't recognize her at the time, this was weird, I didn't even know it was her, I just assumed it was a cop talking to me, asking me how many times I've done shrooms (I thought it was because of my 'murderous rampage' but it was just cuz I was actin real fucked), and strangely I said a couple times, when it's been sooo much more than that. Remembering the voices yelling at me, everything I thought might've happened to me but didn't, I said 'where's my mom?, I wanna talk to her', and this must've been really fuckin weird for them to hear me say that (later I kinda explained myself though). I was asking everyone, what did I do?! And wondering why no one would answer me (no one knew what the hell I was talking about!). So, I heard someone say it's gonna be crazy to explain this to him in the morning (talkin bout me). Still making me think I did something really really bad and stupid. What was really goin on was nothing compared to what I thought was goin on. What was really goin on was nothing compared to what I thought was goin on. So eventually I came to my senses and realized I'm in M's appartment and everything's fine. 
636	0	a	These were some fucked up shrooms. That's not a normal trip, I've never heard of anything like that happening to anyone on shrooms, maybe it's just my weird mind in the state it was in, interacting with all those little things that were goin on, transforming them into perceptions of something very different. I've done quite a bit of shrooms before, every time other than that one, I've handled em very well, had amazing times and loved every second of it. This was a weird trip.

638	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : Difficult Experiences (5), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
639	0	a	Tonight was a great night.  I had done mushrooms before but never at home, only in my college dorm.  Quite a different experience.  We were in one of my best friends' basement and he had never tried them before.  I tried to explain what he could potentially go through beforehand but I felt like there just was not a vocabulary to describe it.  During my trip I wrote the following:  
640	0	a	'I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be writing at the moment. Everything around me has been redefined. Every little challenge and problem is magnified into a full blown dilemma. We sit and overanalyze every decision, every idea, and every action. The lines between our world and the world around us are blurred. Lines which are so permanent in day to day life are broken down and become unclear. Lines which are so permanent in day to day life are broken down and become unclear. What is reality? Because what I am feeling right now is certainly real. But, I know tommorow is a different kind of real. I think I like that one too.'  
641	0	a	Anyways, on to the logistics of the trip.  We ate the mushrooms at about 830 pm after a long day of exercise.  We had biked sixty miles earlier in the day so physically, we were spent going into the trip.  At first I was concerned that this may be a factor but it did not prove to be a problem.  
642	0	a	The first sign came at 9 on the dot when the tv began to subtly ripple.  The coming up, for me, is really all about anticipation and until 45 minutes or so I am fairly normal.  I have yet to puke but I always feel like I'm pretty darn close at about this point.  For the next hour we watched Elf and enjoyed the limited, and often overstated, visual hallucinations.  I have never found the visuals to be the highlight of a trip as the media would have outsiders believe.  And by outsider, I mean those who have never ventured into the shroom world.  
643	0	a	After the initial effects of the mushrooms our minds transitioned from light thoughts to the profound revelations that the drug provides.  My friend, began to become uncomfortable with the blur between his ordinary life and his mind on shrooms.  According to him, he felt so normal physically except his mind was racing and he hoped it would stop.  This effect peaked at about 11, or 150 minutes into the trip and what I would describe as the the climax of the night.  Having never directly experienced this fear I cannot completely relate but from what I have read it is not an uncommon feeling.  
644	0	a	By 1130, we decided some weed would be a great way to put a familiar spin on the trip and chill us out.  We went outside, the change of scenery certainly was welcome, and smoked in the warm spring weather.  It had to have been at least 60 out at midnight.  Having now grounded himself, my friend was able to look back on the experience in awe and equally, admiration.  As much as we feel in control while on the drug, the mind is a powerful thing and it can be unpredictably unpredictable.  Laying out and watching the open expanses of the glowing sky brought back a few visuals but our minds were at peace by 12.  
645	0	a	I am laying in bed at 2am now and my mind is still racing only from a much more familiar perch.  As with any drug, there is a time and a place but mushrooms are definitely a favorite and are truly a way to bond with a close friend.  Enjoy and remember: 'go with the flow' and 'stay positive'.

647	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
648	0	a	My Friend and I were going to local national park in late autumn (in Finland) where we had tripped the year before, this time we chose to go there with bicycles so we would not have hike from there the 20+ km by foot. 
649	0	a	We arrived to the national park and camped in a cottage which was free to use. It had wood stove and plenty of firewood, though we had to split the wood by ourselves from the logs. Left our backbags in  the cottage and hiked to near by hillcliff to smoke some herbs. Up in the hill the view opens large areas of swamp and forrest. The memories from the trip before came to my mind where we danced the hillside up and down in total darkness to drink more mushroom tea and back up to watch the stars. Also remembered our tactic to fight off the bears if we would ever meet one in the darkness, stick together, look big and have your knife ready....and other things that had happened.
650	0	a	Came back to the cottage and smoked some more while preparing for the trip. My friend chopped some firewood and I scaled our doses, 3 grams handpicked psilocyben semilaenca + leftovers from the jar. Took them with classic style... grinded and swallowed with water.
651	0	a	We both had prepared for the trip by fasting so the mushrooms started to hit after 20mins. We were good friends and had tripped together multiple times so we knew how the beginning would go, both in our own ÂspacesÂ and we would meet at the ÂothersideÂ.
652	0	a	The trip started for real after an hour or something when I sat up next to my friend and broke the silence with words... Âdoubt breaks the spellÂ (in finnish = epÃ¤ilys rikkoo taijan). My friend turned to me, thinking what I have just said for a moment and replied Âyy..yes!...YES!Â I don't remember what lead to those words but my friend totally got the idea...
653	0	a	After this we felt something between us, like we were in bubbles that connected, and we knew it when we separated, like if you imagine two soap bubbles that connect as one and then separate them. We felt each other in our minds and to be sure this was not just something that we imagined we started to test this connection. 
654	0	a	We both closed our eyes and turned around and started requesting Âsound alertsÂ from each other in our minds. Beep...Buub....Beep ...Buub back and forth, also switching that only one of us asked the sound alert and other said it out loud exactly when he got the ÂsignÂ to check that this was really happening. 
655	0	a	At first I started to doubt this and thought my friend was messing with me, but already when this thought came to my mind I knew that it wasn't so because I could feel the doubt physically and my friend felt it too...when the doubt tried between us... 
656	0	a	After this we dived in to it fully... no doubt that we just had connected ourselves telepathically and slowly when our bond and mental link grew stronger we slipped deeper in to the trance state and started  screaming and roaring...laughing from the bottom of our hearts that were now connected we just had connected ourselves telepathically and slowly when our bond and mental link grew stronger we slipped deeper in to the trance state and started  screaming and roaring...laughing from the bottom of our hearts that were now connected.. We felt each other in our minds and the feeling the other had, which superscharged our situation even more... I could ROOOOAAR it out loud when my friend supercharged it mentally and switch.  
657	0	a	The moment of madness was crowned by a situation when my friend went to take piss outside and I stayed inside the cottage, we still had the mental link and for my moment of ÂaloneÂ I started thinking something in silence (that I dont remember what it was) but for a weird way my friend recalled from my thought Âsomething his father used to say...Â and I said it out loud... (dont remember what it was), it was multidimensional humor where I found it funny that to my mind there was no connection with my thoughts and what his father used to say and by the fact that I said it out loud what my friend though about my thoughts, in a situation where we had this conversation without any words but those few that I said out loud. (my friend could not see me but he could hear me) We started shouting, screaming and laughing again in a mad telepathic trance state.
658	0	a	When my friend came back in we started to flow together in a river of feelings where we felt what the other felt, we shared our ÂuniversesÂ.. For a moment I stared the dark corner of the cottage and sad thoughts came to my mind and fear... The worst part in that situation was that when I went in the Âdark part of myselfÂ I felt how it made my friend feel who was hugging me in total sadness and trying to get me out from there... that got me out and the Âdarkest hourÂ was behind.  
659	0	a	The stove only had ember now and we tried to put more wood in to the pit, but this was a hard task when we were constantly interrupted by all the conversations we had in that telepathic link. 
660	0	a	We had very long and complicated conversations and there were crossroads in those where we said  something out loud as a Âagreement pointÂ or conclusions. 
661	0	a	We got frustrated by the constant sidetracking and the stove still needed more wood..
662	0	a	We started shouting again...this time we shouted fire Â FIREEE NOW LETS MAKE THAT FIREEE!!! supercharging our roars mentally..... and magically.... the embers lit up... 
663	0	a	This got us laughing hysterically and after that I added more wood with my shaking hands.....we were winners...
664	0	a	Slowly the mental link started fading to the level of sound alerts until the ability for telepathy dissapeared entirely..but the bond we had was stronger than ever and it felt like we could never live without other ever again, that we were bros 4 life.
665	0	a	It was morning already and we backed our stuff and without any sleep we drove back to my friends place with our bicycles. 
666	0	a	Getting so close to other person is a great thing but also sad because no other ÂfriendshipÂ feels so deep anymore.....or maybe its just me..letting the doubt break the spell :D

668	0	a	Mushrooms - P. semilanceata (90) : Relationships (44), General (1), Alone (16)
669	0	a	We were camping at one beach in my country, not crowded at all, we were basically my friends and me. I ate 2 hours into their trip, and there was a sober friend. I completely acknowledge that this kind of substance in this kind of dose can really really go bad, because I had no control of what was bombing my mind at all, even when I had done enough research before I ate it. The dose is unknown and will remain like that my whole life, which was definitely irresponsible.
670	0	a	I can't just say everything was good, I had a ton of time where everything was confusion, I had fear, I experienced the worst fear I have had in my life. But at some point on the trip I accepted everything.
671	0	a	At some point when it started hitting and were I would go to different 'movies' that were projected directly into my sight, which at those points wasn't looking at reality. I accepted that I was a complete ignorant, not only of the crazy shit that was being on a trip, but about a ton of aspects on my life, and that I take it as a teaching.
672	0	a	Up until I accepted that I was an ignorant, and really accepted it as something that didn't make me any less than the others, which is when I started happily telling my friends that 'everything was pure shit', 'nothing really matters'. At that point I had accepted that all that was importance was existence, it was the only true, I was there on a small piece of land with 5 other entities just like me, because at that point I didn't have a body, my body didn't matter at all at that point I didn't have a body, my body didn't matter at all, I would look at it in such a funny way like something that was there and was mine, but I didn't have respect for. I thought 'What if I kill myselfÂ¿' and that didn't have a meaning because, time didn't exists, I was trapped in that state forever, if I'd kill myself, I would just continue on in that state after my body died. Money was meaningless, I would grab my phone and throw it around the sand. Sexual morbo wasn't part of that state either, when I had control I asked if I had been nude at some point because It just didn't matter to me. My friends were trying to get me to see the stars, which were amazing, one could see the galaxy at naked eye. But I felt the worst fear of my life, I wanted to run away, I wanted to cry, they meant to me that whole bunch of stuff that I can't understand and that I've felt fear for during my whole life.
673	0	a	That was much of the time I was learning a lot of stuff. Then comes the time where I am reconstructing myself, my body was still meaningless, and the picture of that guy I was seemed to be so far away from what I was at that time, but my friends would say something about me, who I was and I would have flash backs, I would have like photos of how I look go through my brain, and I was accepting that was me but It felt so distant. Then at some point I learned to reason, to make a conclusion, because all the time on the trip thoughts would just come at me, I wasn't reasoning at all, and just slowly felt myself coming back. But that only happened completely the next day when I woke up.
674	0	a	During that whole trip everything was in symbols to me, nothing of course is as clear as I have pictured on what I may have learned. Emotions were 1000 times greater, I felt empathy as I have never had, I felt love for my friends as I never did. The trees had life, there was one judging me, another that was too ugly. I would see the face of one friend turn a bit into a demon. I would see my body stretch into a super thin being with a friend being massive in front of my feet. I would see a friend dancing and a whole of tracers as he moved. Colors were amazing. I would go again into places that I cannot describe. I would associate temperature with some friends, one was warm and the other one was cold, I grabbed my warm friend with my hands and it felt so nice, if the other tried to touch me I would slur him about how cold he was. The tastes of stuff was so odd too.

677	0	a	It was a beutiful sunday and a freind and I planned on tripping mushrooms. We split a rather large cap and took some where around 2 - 2.5 grams each. I chewed my mushrooms very finly and chased it down with a little bit of orange juice. We then smoked some pot to curb the naseua to ensure we tripped well. We walked down to a public park near by the river. We sat and smoked more pot to some Bob Marley. I had a bit of anxiety due to the excitement of consuming mushrooms for my first time. We sat there and waited for our trip to begin. I noticed that every once in a while I would breifly see strange spider webs that had a supernatural shine to them. But I wasnt sure if it was anything.
678	0	a	I closed my eyes and it hit me like a brick to the face, I was getting intense closed eye visuals, it was beutifully brilliant and colorful, patterns fly all around. To see this made me feel very overwhelmed. So I opened up my eyes to see that my surroundings had changed immensely. All of the trees seemes to breath in and out. The leaves and vines curled up into odd shapes. At this point I new I was tripping and there was no backing out now. Everything seemed to have a Dr. Seus apearence to it. I squeezed my jaw and I crushed it into ball, when I let go of it and it sprung back out to its natural form.
679	0	a	I began laughing nervously as I looked over to my friend , wondering if he had began tripping to. It took me by total suprise when I saw my freinds face had skeleton bone patterns moving all over. It was suggested that we smoke more pot but I was going to crazy from my surroundings to gather my thoughts to get my pipe and pot out. I was in awe of my freinds face melting away. I eventually managed to load another bowl and we smoked. My arms looked like they were under kalida-scope vision and I saw mesquito bites on my arms dancing around. My veins in my arms began to change and make diamond patterns. 
680	0	a	At this point I was seeing fractals all over the ground and trees. Hypnotic lizard patterns were every where, it was overwhelming, we later left that spot and started walking, I looked over at the river and stared into the water. I met up later with my freind, he was peaking at this concrete structure and colors were swarming all over us. 
681	0	a	My moods changed from extremely happy to scared off and on. We found a gazeebo and thats when everything turned into a nightmare. The trees and vines all began turning evil and wicked. I was dehydrating and started having a bad fucking trip. My freind came to the rescue with water and I felt like I was on top of the world again. 
682	0	a	I spent most of the trip watching the trees drop beads of sweat off of themselves. The tree limbs contorted and twisted into spirals. The trip itself lasted about 4 hours. After the trip I felt peaceful and calm.
683	0	a	Overall I enjoyed myself and I enjoyed the profound experience that the mushrooms gave to me.

686	0	a	It was just about two weeks ago when I tripped for the first time.  I am sixteen years old and I had been reading up on shrooms and was all for it.  My best friend(Ill call him Z) that I was going to do them with told me not to underestimate the trip or else it might turn bad.  
687	0	a	I got some a quarter ounce of shrooms off of a friend that I have known for a pretty long time.  He told me that they were pretty potent.  My family was going out of town to visit my brother in college so I stayed at Z's house for the weekend.  We started a little campfire in the back yard and then went inside to eat the shrooms.  
688	0	a	I heard that they tasted awful so I got a cup of orange juice ready.  They werent bad at all.  I ate them 1 by 1 and chewed them up very well.  Ive heard that the better you chew them the more affective.  It took about 5 minutes to finish them off.  We then went back out to the fire.  
689	0	a	After about 20 minutes I started staring at this bush in the woods that was bright yellow and completely stood out from everything else.  It started twisting and pulsing and growing.  That was just the beginning of a great first trip.  It started raining a few minutes later.  I couldnt actually feel the rain drops on my head but I could feel my head getting cold.  
690	0	a	We went inside and started playing on the piano togethor.  It was AMAZING!!  We arent that good at the piano in the first place, but I didnt even think about that.  It felt like every note was an addition to a masterpiece that we were creating.  The keys on the piano were rolling like waves.  I played like I was expressing my feelings.  Then when me and z were playing it felt like we were talking to each other through the piano.  It was by far the best feeling ever.  
691	0	a	After playing for about an hour we just sat around talking about how we felt and about the world.  It felt like everything we said was really deep and thoughtful.  Some things actually were and some things were pointless.  Z and I have been best friends for about 9 years and we were agreeing about everything and we understood eachother on every subject.  
692	0	a	After about four hours of tripping we decided that it was one of the best experiences of our lives and was time to got to bed.  That night had finally come to an end.  It was the best feeling in the world.

695	0	a	My story: It was about 2:50 am and I had some shrooms under my bed. There were 4 stems and about 2 crushed up Caps. I decided to eat them all. So I put them in my mouth chewed them up pretty good and swallowed them. I heard that Oranje Juice made them stronger so I had about 5 glasses afterwards lol. 
696	0	a	20 Minutes later: I started feeling wierd and numb kind of inside and thats about it. 
697	0	a	1 hour into it: I felt heavy numbness but still nothing to much and I started gettin mad thinkin they weren't going to work. 
698	0	a	1:20 Minutes: I walked over to my bed and I felt I had spider legs. Like they were really long and pointy. So went back to my computer and listened to some techno music and closed my eyes. It was INSANE! As my eyes were closed I felt and saw things as if I was traveling through space. I counted about 12 different worlds that I went to. Then this lady took me to space and I was really believing that it was happening to me. Then I opened my eyes and I was like WHAT! I'm still here. So  I went and layed down by my heater and I heard lots of voices talking to me. I would have conversations that lasted years with them, only to look at the clock and only seconds have past. Time seemed to take forever, and before I took them I never thought it could seem so long. I thought people exaggerated but its true. Time seems FOREVER!
699	0	a	Then I was typing on my keyboard and all the keys stretched out! They reminded me of an army marching around. Then I went and layed back down by the heater and my foot melted into the door and I saw a boat sticking out of my ceiling! So I went and layed back down and just had crazy thoughts. Going to different planets, falling through my bed and stuff like that. I then opened my eyes and my room was only 2 dimensional! CRAZY! I didnt know how it was working like that. I couldnt understand why I was stuck in such a small place. That seemed to had lasted 20 minutes but when I looked at the clock, not a minute had passed. After that I looked at pictures on my wall and they spun around eachother. Things seemed to move out of place alot that night.
700	0	a	After that it was like 5:30 in the morning so I took a shower. The water felt like it was falling through my back but I couldnt see it coming out my stomach. It was wierd. Then I had to get ready for school and the rest of the day I had trouble thinkin hard and stuff like that. 
701	0	a	In conclusion, mushrooms are a magical drug. I still have crazy ideas and creative thoughts. I. Before this, was very uncreative. Now I seem to be able to imagine crazy things really easy.

705	0	a	The night started on a wafting boom. My cousin had previously bought the shrooms and we were both excited about taking them, since this was the first time for both of us. My cousin hadn't even tried marijuana before, let alone a psychedelic drug. I admire her courage. Though she said it wasn't courage, just curiosity and shrooms are easier to take in public.
706	0	a	Anyway, I left the dosage up to her and I had approximately 2-4 grams, she had the rest, which was about 2.5-4.5 grams. We ordered a pepperoni pizza, so as to disguise the taste and drank orange juice with the rancid tasting things.
707	0	a	We popped in the Powerpuff girls movie and I don't know how long before time had passed before I started to feel weird. A different state of mind came over me. We were sitting in her basement, it was dark outside and her dog kept howling outside the glass door. Pretty soon, I became completely confused on what was happening during the movie and it became almost intolerable to watch. I noticed I was clenching my jaw alot, but this just might have been because I couldn't wait for the movie to get over. I felt like I was going to jump out of my chair. Then the movie was over and we went outside-to her barn. It was so peaceful out there. I just sat in the snow and listened to her horse eat. I went into my own world.
708	0	a	The world seemed to be 2-D, like I could just step out of it and into the 3-D world, but I had to find the 3-D world first. Then a paranoid feeling came over me that I was solidifying. Everything seemed to solidify. I needed to keep up with the solidification because 'they' were going to catch me in my unusual, 3-D, unsolidified world. I talked myself out of this nonsense, or else it might have ruined the trip. I remember glancing in the mirror and my pupils looked square. I looked closer and they were still square. I would have looked at my cousins eyes to see if they were square, but she seemed to be in a very angry mood and I didn't want to deal with that. I'm sure my pupils weren't actually square, I really don't think they even dialated (I'm prone to dialation).
709	0	a	We went outside again and smoked a joint. After that, I became completely at peace and felt like I should do some stretching. I laid out on my bed and stretch some yoga moves and it felt incredible. I must have fallen asleep watching television, as did my cousin. The next day was painful to wake up to. My body felt dead, but my mind was more clear than I could remember. I had been a heavy pot-smoker for two or three years before and craved it daily. After my mushroom experience, I did not seem to need marijuana. It was just something people did in their bored free time. I had also tried other drugs, like acid and dex, and now feel disgusted of ever doing them. I most likely will never take shrooms, or any other hard drugs, again. I might smoke weed now and then, but it feels good to know that I don't need it to live life.

712	0	a	Me and my Seattle, have been growing mushrooms for quite a while now, and we are on our third batch, we have a whole selection of different types. Well we have gained a considerable amount on knowledge about psilocybin and its mother the mushroom. What we wanted is the absolute STRONGEST ( azurescens) mushroom available, and then we would mix it with the HIGHEST YEILDING (we chose the B+ strain) to make a good batch for people to buy. Well we grew them, and treated them like our children, till one day we had what looked like a sea of sacred mana. We had learned that the aborts (ones that didn't fully grow) were the strongest. So we decided to take ALL of the azurescen aborts to our domes. 
713	0	a	It was 5:00 and we were ready to trip, we brought along a couple other friends ill call them Goober and Datsun. We each took 1.5 grams and soaked them in warm water and drank the tea, and ate the other half raw. Within about 15 minutes the effects were coming on. I felt like my heart was being pulled down and I had a little bit of vertigo. I asked Goober how he was doing and he replied with a wide eyed smile. Everyone else was inside Seattle's house playing X-box, me and Goober were outside having a Djarum. 
714	0	a	After talking for 15 minutes with Goober I felt a WAVE of vertigo overcome me, and I became almost sea sick. I told Goober and he just looked at me with this empty stare and began laughing! For some reason this pissed me off. Yet I just simply started laughing. The body sensations seemed to be tickling my brain. The world became a confusing mess. It was almost as if I were tanked, and standing on the edge of a building looking down. We just LAUGHED and LAUGHED, before I knew it we were laying on the ground running in circles (homer style). In five minutes Seattle and Datsun came running out of the house. But Datsun just bashed into the screen door *THWAP* the sound warped in my mind and played over and over. Then we all just started laughing. Laying on the ground laughing out asses off as Datsun sat there Dazed, rubbing his head. By this time the body sensations were becoming a little intense.
715	0	a	All in the same mind set, we decided to stumble into the house and partake in the pop rocks we had purchased earlier. It was simply amazing, It felt as though my mouth was a volcano, my tongue felt numb but the top of my mouth was exploding. I then said 'ITS STARWARRRRRRS IN MY MOUTH' this was a mistake, because the peak of the trip seemed to hit everyone at once. I looked at Datsun's face and his sideburns turned purple, I just said 'wow...' and trailed off. Datsun tried to utter a 'you fucking idiot' but it sounded more like 'Joo Trucking IDOT!' this made Seattle go wide eyed in expression, he ran to his room and crouched over an empty box of ritz crackers and started dry heaving. We all heard him horking from the other room and we started to panic. I layed down on the ground and closed my eyes, and the visuals suddenly hit me like a cosmic truck full of, well... Psilocybin. The colors swirled around each other and danced. I could ACTUALLY see buddah with a spinning star around his head and a swirling vortex of a background. But wait... I was being sucked into the vortex. I felt a chilly wind on the back of my head. Although I was laying on my back. And was squeezed through the little hole in the middle of the vortex. Buddah seemed to be inviting me into his land. I entered the vortex and entered a room in my consciousness. Confusion overtook me as swirling patterns convulsed all over the hundreds of walls. The sun rose behind my eyes, I saw myself as an old man. I saw so many unbelievable things. I had kind of broken through the tension of the come up and broken into an ego loss state. This continued for an eternity.
716	0	a	I woke up to a cold splash on my face. It was seattle, he asked me if I wanted to play X-Box for some reason. I shook my head, the outside world moved to the music in the background (shpongle). The lamp beside his TV literally danced. It took a bow. Then I picked up the xbox controller and walked to the couch and sat down. Somehow I was starting to exit my state of terror, I almost felt... Good!. WAIT I FELT GOOD. I threw aside the controller, and went to find Goober so we could talk some more. I FELT HAPPY! I eventually found him in the kitchen drinking tea. we sat outside, and talked about our adventures while smoking Djarums. Eventually we came down. 
717	0	a	The whole trip lasted around 8 hours. The next morning I woke up with a slight hangover, and objects still slightly moved when I would stare at them.
718	0	a	I have tried many drugs, such as; salvia, 2c-b, marijuana (although I cant smoke anymore), DMT, 5-Meo-DMT and 2c-t-7. But this trip was by far the most spiritual. While I was in my dream state, I decided to start seriously meditating, I decided to get more active and get physically fit. Above all I learned to respect drugs! This trip report is but a fraction of what happened.
719	0	a	All in all I guess this trip report was just another brick in the wall. Peace.

722	0	a	I have tried many drugs and have decided that there is nothing I like more then a good psychedlic. So far my list of experiences includes Salvia (5-10), Peyote (1), LSD(10-15), Psilocybin (15-20), DPT (1), DXM (1), MDMA (5-6), 5MEO-DMT (2), Syrian Rue (2), and my most intense and most terrifying, Ayahuasca (4) with my last trip (20 grams mimosa 5 grams syrian rue) leaving me cowering in the corner swearing to myself that I would never touch a drug again if I came back to reality. Of course I came back and was more then ready to dose up a month later. I still have not totally recovered from it (3 months ago) so I have been dosing much lower and with less frequency. I have also been slightly depressed as of late so that has effected how deep I am willing to go.
723	0	a	For the 4th of July four of my friends and I took 2 grams of mushies cultivated by myself.  After I dried the mushies I ground them in a coffee grinder and put them into chocolate. I mixed up a large amount of chocalate (50 grams mushies) and stored them in the fridge for six months and they never changed in potency.
724	0	a	The trip was mild for me but every one had a great time (plus plus). We dosed outside at a friends house and walked to a forest preserve when they started to kick in. With the mushies in the chocolate they kick in almost twice as fast. On the way to the forest someone lit off a firework that shot a 1/2 stick 100 feet in the air. The blast felt incredible (I felt the air get sucked in and blown out) and my vision totally changed after it went off. There where strange orange neon blobs in my peripheral vision and I felt as if I was observing everything a foot or two above my body.
725	0	a	At the peak of our trips we sat in a huge field and watched the sunset. It was very beautiful and the wind felt great flowing around my body. The remainder of the trip was spent sitting around a fire and watching the fireworks. Most of my visuals where gone (2.5-3 hours in) but I still had some spatial distortion and more vivd colors. Everyone else still seemed to be pretty good as they ran around carefree lighting off fireworks and laughing at everything.
726	0	a	All in all it was a great time that I would love to repeat.

729	0	a	I waited for my husband to come home from a cow pasture near our house and bring me the mushrooms. I had previously asked a student of oaxacan psychelic usage who told me mushrooms are used by some pregnant women in that culture. And that they are not seen as dangerous for the baby or the mama. So I tried them. They were 7 mushrooms medium size in average.
730	0	a	That I ate with some orange. About 30 min later, I couldn't stop myself from laughing almost hysterically over anything I could think of. Aware that the trip had started I felt pleased and hopeful. I felt that I was being gently pulled towards a tunnel made of whatever the whole universe is made of. I tried going deeper into it but it just faded. I was using the will of my physical body to transport me there and not my ethereal will. Thats what I felt like and eventually heard it. 
731	0	a	Then it was there. My mother. The mother. She was there by my side. Talking to me. Telling me things. Showing me the beauty of my physical body. And wondering why I would mistreat it like I usually do. It was the first body to take care of. The only body that is under my care for as long as I live on earth. I rubbed it and touched it with awe. I was my own daughter and my own mother. I was in ecstasy, being pregnant of myself. That love and care that I'm supposed to take for my body, for myself is the only thing that I need to exercise in order to be a good mother for my coming baby. Who was completely calm. (I usually provoke some of his moving by having stressful thoughts or sudden reactions to a situation.) And that self love was way more profound than meaning to put my 'personal needs' before my baby's. It went into higher meaning. Loving truly the human I'm wearing since I was born, allows my being to love in the same unlimitted and unconditional way for every single being. 
732	0	a	So then I asked questions and she showed me pictures. I thought of Jesus and understood his attitude in front of the crucifixion. Either it happened or not, I decided to do the same.  I gave up all my 'belongings'  the self image I want to show others and my body too. I still had it all but it was no longer mine. I gave it all up. ( surprisingly, that same day a neighbor knocked the door and asked for me so I could lent her some money. I knew before that she wasn't serious to pay back but I asked my husband to give her the money. Coz there was no sense on keeping it if she needed some and asked me for it) Anyway, my ego came back slowly and a question arose. Will you be here for the great day, mother? She said 'of course' what can I do if my baby wont be born during the mushroom season? She said 'just call me when you need me, I'll be here with you'. I felt her leaving soon after and begged her to stay. But it was ok, she showed me the life I was missing. And without that life I could never be a 'good' parent. I had lapses of paranoia and sadness for the human race. But I had one person in the world that I could surely save. Me. 
733	0	a	The great day happened. We planned a homebirth. A beautiful experience intimate and sacred for my husband and me to enjoy. It became overwhelming. We had a little of dry mushroom extract that I tried to help me cope with the labor. It didn't work. So I rushed to the hospital because 'it hurt too much' . I had a traumatizing delivery there. My husband and I were not allowed to be together. I thought for months that 'the mother' had failed me. But I see now that she was there all the time. 'She' is with me all the time. I just have to learn to turn the volume down of my ego and I'll be able to hear 'her'. I think mushrooms take us to the state of mind that we are supposed to live in. But then is our job to remember and work our way back there by ourselves. 
734	0	a	My baby is now 24 months old and people say he is brilliant but I think he is as smart as any kid of his age. I love him very much and I thank him for choosing me as his parent. He is my spiritual master.

737	0	a	It was a normal night in April like any other night, but a friend of mine who shall be referred to as M had found someone to sell mushrooms to us. We met this person and each bought an eighth (approximately 3.5 grams) of dried mushrooms. Neither of us had done mushrooms before, but the person who sold them to us suggested that we both ingest a whole eighth.
738	0	a	We went to M's house and ingested the mushrooms and drank soda to diffuse the foul taste of the substance at around 11:30 P.M. At around 12:00 to 12:30 the effects began to hit us. An extremely overwhelming body high and euphoric feeling came over us very suddenly. Soon after M and I began to see colors much more vividly and patterns seemed to shift. This seemed to be an amazing substance that I couldn't believe I hadn't experienced before. We went outside to stare at nature and the moon for about an hour or so and his younger brother came outside and hung out with us fully aware of the circumstances.
739	0	a	At around 2 A.M. we went back inside due to being cold outside and wanting to be able to see more during this experience. We went inside and sat down on M's couch to talk and look around. M's brother went back upstairs around 2:30 A.M. to go to sleep.
740	0	a	At some point around 3 A.M. I completely lost all control of my own body. It was very similar to a the anterograde
741	0	a	amnesia often associated with the over-consumption of alcohol. I had what at the time seemed like a very vivid, but unrealistic dream that included M pushing me out of the door to his house and screaming 'Get the fuck out of my house!' at me and another sequence in which I threw a glass of water onto M's father and finally ending with a sequence of me in my car throwing things out of my bag around the inside of my car and hitting the windshield. It was at this point around 4:00 A.M. that I regained consciousness in my own car with my rear view mirror broken off and all of my personal belongings strewn around my car and I noted that I didn't have shoes on as I looked down at my grass stained feet. I looked to the left out of the driver's side door and M and his parents were all standing there looking at me in shock. I was then driven to my home while I sat in the back seat wondering what in the world could have possibly caused this strange state of unknowing brutality that caused M to get in a fight with me to get me out of his house. I later looked on the internet for similar experiences, but I couldn't find anything. It should be noted that I am prescribed amitriptyline(20 mg) to take at night to help me sleep, but I did not take it on the night of this occurrence. This medication could have had some interaction, but I could not find any further information documenting the interaction between these two things.

744	0	a	The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
745	0	a	It was Friday night and I had acquired a rather large amount of cubensis the day before. I had a quarter ounce of what I believe to be liberty caps and a half ounce of some huge white mushrooms with blue-black stains on them. I had given about 3g of the liberties to my sister and her boyfriend, and we went to laser tag which was a blast. I was waiting until I got home to take my shrooms but they had a pretty good trip while they played. 
746	0	a	As soon as I got home at about 7:45 I ate up my shrooms. I had taken out about 2g of liberties for my friend S who would be over in about 30 minutes, it would be his first time taking shrooms. I have had a fair bit of experience with LSD and shrooms in the past and consider myself well-prepared mentally for a heroic dose, so I ate all the powder and most of the liberty caps, and then all of the half ounce of big white shrooms, coming to about 17g total. I threw up while swallowing down the big white ones, but I swallowed it back down because I didnÂt want to waste the shrooms.
747	0	a	I began to feel great after about 5 minutes and when I closed my eyes I had the most amazing bright and colorful visuals. It was amazing! I began to trip harder and harder and by the time S showed up I was really messed up. IÂm pretty sure around this time I smoked a bowl of some dank weed.
748	0	a	Monday was going to be SÂs birthday, so I gave him his shrooms for free and was going to smoke him out when they began to take hold. After he ate them it started to get pretty crazy for me. I cried and told   him how beautiful life is and how weÂre going to be dead one day. I felt like I really knew what that meant. It was so so amazing. I felt great about the whole experience so far.
749	0	a	After a few minute of enlightenment and euphoria, I can only describe how I started to think as rapid realizations and thoughts about life. I started to ramble on about ÂWhy am I me? Why are you you? What do you think being a dog is like? Why do we get the privilege of being human beings?Â I also felt like everything else in the world that I had only read about or seen on TV, such as foreign countries and everyone in the government were all just made up or something. They just didnÂt feel real.
750	0	a	My friend thought I was acting a little crazy so I decided it was best to relax and listen to music. I plugged in my headphones and couldnÂt even focus enough to plug in my iPod. I just laid there and felt so ridiculous. I didnÂt need music because I could start to hear this horrible, haunting sound. I canÂt really explain it, except that it scared me. This was the first time IÂd felt scared on psychedelics. I started to feel disconnected with my body, as if all I were was a floating brain, beginning to rise out of my body, very gradually.
751	0	a	I yanked off my headphones and asked S how he was feeling. He didnÂt feel anything yet. I sat there and listened while he was watching Avatar: The Last Airbender and it sounded so strange to me. The speech seemed slow and dim and I couldnÂt really understand any of it. Suddenly S said ÂI think IÂm starting to feel something.Â Which got me pretty excited. My friend S takes anti-depressants and I think  this is why things went how they did for him. By this time S had smoked a bowl of my dank.
752	0	a	He started to feel great and I knew exactly what he meant, it was how my trip started out. But by now things were extremely distorted for me, my body didnÂt feel or look like it was mine. I laid in bed in amazement at how strong this was coming on, maybe about 45 minutes to an hour after I had taken them. My reality became unrecognizable My reality became unrecognizable, I felt completely dissociated from my body. I was absorbed into the fabric of the universe and felt indescribable. It was terrifying yet extraordinarily amazing. I couldnÂt feel my body, everything looked jumbled and colorful. When I tried to touch something I couldnÂt feel myself touch it of feel that I was using my arm. I couldnÂt really do much. It occurred to me that S was having the same trip, but on a much lesser dose.
753	0	a	 After what seemed like an eternity of the most intense experience of my life, I finally calmed down enough to talk to S and see how he was doing. He calmed down at the same time as me (I donÂt think his peak was quite as bad) and we decided to get something to drink. Before we went we started laughing hysterically at what just happened to us, and we both felt great to know we were returning back to normal. We went downstairs where my grandma was, and into the kitchen. She came in and I tried to hide my face from her by looking busy with my hoodie, trying to zip it up. But I was struggling immensely. ÂWhat are you doing?Â she asked me. ÂNothing just, er, fumbling with this,Â I said extremely nervous.
754	0	a	When I finally get it zipped up I turn to the fridge to get a drink but sheÂs standing behind me staring at me. I look at her and canÂt keep from smiling and immediately she knows somethingÂs up. S ran away upstairs freaked out. After a brief exchange in which Definite Overdose
755	0	a	I told her nothing was going on, she went back into the living room, very upset. I went in and apologized and felt horrible. We talked for a few minutes and I apologized. I told her I took mushrooms and tripped out so bad that I never wanted to do drugs again, and we talked for awhile about it.
756	0	a	 After that I went upstairs and S and I hung out for awhile. I was still tripping really hard but it was mostly just a happy joyous feeling. We smoked some more bud so weÂd feel better but it just made us trip out again. I laid in bed and commenced to make strange howling noises in the middle of which we broke out in more extreme laughter. We felt great at the time and got on the computer and smoked some more bud. The next two hours or so just consisted of us talking about what just happened and finishing off our weed, which by the time we finished it was making me trip rather hard again. S laid down and eventually fell asleep, while I attempted to play some Skyrim. The bud proved too much for me though and I promptly passed out while sitting in the chair, later awakened by my grandma. I climbed into bed and felt amazing as the breeze from my open windows swept across me.
757	0	a	I woke up this morning feeling extremely hung over and definitely not all there mentally. I still remember vividly what I felt last night, and I hope I do forever. After that experience I have no desire to acquire marijuana or any drug for that matter. I feel like IÂve gotten what I wanted out of the trip and I feel great about life. S and I have no regrets about what we did but we both agreed it wouldnÂt be happening again.

759	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Small Group (2-9) (17)
760	0	a	Well me and 3 of my friends bought a quad of mushrooms from this guy I just met at school.  I had done shrooms numerous times before but (after this experience I know) they musn't have been that great.  So we smoked probably an 8th of weed, then  me and my friend Sean split the shroom sack.  It was Seans first time so I was kinda sketchy on the idea.
761	0	a	We start playing football with some friends(BAD IDEA). Then the shrooms started hitting us so we walked back to my house.  We both lied on the grass in my backyard and staired at the stars.  I felt a more extreme body high then ever before but my mind kept telling me I wasnt on anything.  The stars were moving but I convinced myself there were just a lot of shooting stars that night or something.  I looked over at sean and he was rubbing his face on my stucko wall proclaiming how great it felt.  My dad came home with mc donalds so I grabbed a bag of food and left.  We went to walk seans dog. 
762	0	a	We were walking down the street when I start tripping hard(but still good) I was feeling great.  I kept putting my food in my mouth and spitting it out cause I couldnt swallow. SO I dropped the food and went to a wall to take a pee.  I turned from the wall and found sean and his dogg eating the mc donalds off the middle of the street.  My legs felt really warm so I asked sean repetedly if I had peed on myslef.  I was really confused.  This is when my trip turned bad because sean breaks out in a sprint down the street screaming at me to get away from the 'people' chasing us. I was still feeling my pants trying to understand whether I peed on myself or not. I finally got what he said and looked back.  I just saw 1 huge shaddow coming towards me so I figured it was a lot of people packed really close together.  I was terrified!  I started running with me. He then told me that he was sure he was dieing and he didnt know what to do.  That made me start thinking about dieing, and I thought I was dieing too.  We split up and went home.
763	0	a	I walked into my house and went strait to my room where I couldnt sit still. I was scared out of my mind. I was extremely hott so I went to the shower (DUMB DUMB DUMB).  I dont know what happened in the shower, but when I got out... I didn't know who I was, where I was, or how to put my clothes back on (or even what clothes were for that matter). I didn't know who I was, where I was, or how to put my clothes back on (or even what clothes were for that matter).  So I held my towel and emediately walked to the kitchen and grabbed a gallon of milk.  My dad found me in the kitchen naked with a gallon of milk in my hand.  He said, 'What the F*** are you doing?'. I then said, 'I am dieing and I dont know what to do.'  My dad told me to put on my clothes but I still didnt know how so he sat me down and attempted to calm me down.  I called sean and our conversation went like this, I said 'sean?' and he said 'Nathan, I am freaking out, I'm sitting curled in the corner of my room and we are out of milk! Am I going to die?'  I was trippin to so I tried my best to calm him down. He then screamed 'ahhhh!!, I got to go' and hung up the phone.
764	0	a	I threw up and within 15 minutes and I wasnt tripping anymore.  I was very relieved.  Ever since then sean has been to mental hospitals many times. He doesnt talk to me anymore and pretty much keeps to himself I guess. I still do shrooms but I barely have to take a gram to trip. I dont think ill ever be the same since then. Thanks for reading.

766	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Bad Trips (6), Various (28)
767	0	a	One day out of the blue, I decided I wanted to eat an 1/8th of mushrooms.  My boyfriend at the time, me and two of my other guy friends all ingested them quickly swollowing them down with orange juice.  We heard the mushrooms are much more intense when ingested with Vitamin C.  It was one of my friends first time taking them and he also took 1/8.  We will call him Mike.
768	0	a	My last trip was about 3 months ago, so I was ready to feel good.  However, I did not know what was about to occur.  About 45 min. later I started to feel my trip coming on.  Right at the beginning I knew it was not going to be good.  I was afraid to look at anything and just wanted to close my eyes.  My friends were all wide-eyed and happy while I sat there with eyes closed.  I dont know why I was so terrified and I could not stop it.  We all then went into my boyfriend's room and sat and listended to music.  This is when it started to get really bad.  My mind took over and I could not control anything.  I sat curled up in a ball telling everyone I was going insane.  And I really thought I was.  I started to cry and shake.  My friend Mike who was trying it for the first time and my other friend left and went for a walk but I could not move because i was so terrified.  I constantly felt like I needed to pee but I couldnt.  My stomach hurt incredibly bad and I felt like I was peeing myself but when I went to the bathroom nothing was there.
769	0	a	After 3 hours of going insane, crying and shaking my friends returned to get me and my boyfriend at the time.  My friend Mike was also going insane asking everyone the question..'Am I real...what is real?'  We had to leave him behind because he could not handle the walk we were about to take.  Once I left the room and went outside I felt much better.  We walked around and I felt extremely close to the people I was with.
770	0	a	In short, I believe I ingested something into my body without thinking pleasant thought before doing so.  I would have had a better trip if I would have done this.  Also the people with who I am tripping is a huge deal as well.  After this experience I broke up with my boyfriend.  I had somewhat of an epiphany and knew that if I could not overcome my insanity during that time with his help, I could not be with him because it was doomed.  Maybe that was a bad reason but all is well now.

773	0	a	My first psychedelic mushroom experience occurred on Sunday, June 11th, 2006. It lasted roughly four hours, not counting the after-effects, which lasted roughly three or four more hours.
774	0	a	Both I and my girlfriend ingested 2 grams of mushroom material each in the form of a tea. We ate the soggy mushroom bits after drinking the tea. At first, not knowing what to expect, I sat around waiting for the walls to melt. Instead, when nothing happened, I decided to go for a walk.
775	0	a	This is when it kicked in. We were climbing a hill when several of the larger rocks started swirling (their surfaces, at least). P, my girlfriend, did not notice this, but she noticed that everything seemed... Well... Odd, and bright. Out of place.
776	0	a	We talked, for a while, to a friend of P's that we met when we crested a hill that led onto a road. She had been riding a bicycle, and for some reason I couldn't help but imagine that it was alive. It seemed to be watching me.
777	0	a	After she left, we continued and climbed a small mountain (easy going, not too much work, and relatively safe). Here, we rested.
778	0	a	I kept screaming 'It's so big! Everything is so BIG!!!'
779	0	a	The scenery was ethereal, fantastical. It was beautiful, but in an epic, immaterial, and dreamlike way. I loved it. The clouds were radiant, and the sun was setting in the far distance, but they seemed rather eerie, in a manner I can't seem to put to words. At this point, we decided to head back to my house.
780	0	a	We spent the rest of the trip proper in the confines of my room, except when I walked her home.
781	0	a	While in my room, we talked and just chilled, watching the unpredictable scenery.
782	0	a	Unfortunately for me, things turned a bit sour. I got scared and panicky, which led me to believe that my family was out to get me. I looked out the door of my room and into the hallway where my brother was standing. He was very scary, and he was angry at me for something, so I retreated back into the haunted sanctitude of my room.
783	0	a	I thought I was going insane at one point, and needed my similarly overwhelmed (perhaps moreso, with her smaller body weight - about half of mine) - yet much more calm girlfriend to calm me down with soft, reassuring touches, friendly noises, grapes, and then a back massage.
784	0	a	Overall, it was GREAT, and it blew my mind. I can't really explain it in a different way, it was inconstant and hard to explain even to my fellow tripper.

787	0	a	 It was around July when me, my friend kyle, and my friend eric decided to take an eighth of mushrooms each. It was my second time eating them and the first time I took them I didnt really trip hard because I had only taken a half eighth and just got a big body buzz.
788	0	a	Anyways, it was about 7 or 8 at night when we took them and we were heading over to my friend erics sisters house who was cool with shit.For the first hour or so we were just laughing hysterically for no apparent reason. Not long after the laughing died down we started getting into these very deep conversations about life and who we are. I had been in some pretty bad groups and done some pretty rotten things and they started to come out in my trip like I was viewing my life through someone els's prospective. I started crying very badly and couldn't explain why I was so sad.My friends finally got me to get a grip and let me know it was going to be alright. After all the crying and everything we got into some other talks about things, it was freaking me out though, when we were talking and analyzing shit it was almost as if I could feel what they were feeling just by looking into their eyes, I knew what my friend was thinking and he knew it too, we would be sitting there and we would meet eyes and we would both be like what? Because we were both reading each other but didnt want to admit it, it was very wierd.
789	0	a	That night I learned alot about myself and my friends and how reflective things in your life are of oneself. After that night I started thinking about life alot more and realizing the beauty that we dont realize in our everyday fast life. I found out that everything has a soul, noone is alike, and shrooms, if used right, can be the key to solving some problems one has in life and finding oneself. 
790	0	a	Overall when I took those shrooms, it's a little scary and overwhelming at first but gave me a great outlook on things that are deep inside of myself. They are very theraputic for me, and most of the people I talk to have something positive to say. Well I hope you like my story. Thanks

793	0	a	I decided to do shrroms for a third time as I had great experiences with them in the past. I decided to take an 1/8 since its what I had done twice prior. I made a tea out of dried shrooms and drank them quickly along with my friend. 30 minutes into it we both began feeling the effects. It began with euphoria and complete understanding of what we were as humans. We were having a great time untill it slowly began to intensify. It didnt neccessarily turn into a bad trip but it certainly wasnt fun any longer as both of use began to lose all conception of reality. I began to believe that my entire life was an illusion, that nothing was at all real and I could go anywhere I wanted if I so chose to. It was an entirly schizophranic existence for both of us. I took the shrooms around 630 and at this point it was about 9 pm although it seemed like much longer. At this point I walked into the kitchen to get some water in which case I remember waking up on my kitchen floor and my friend violently shaking me and telling me I had fainted. He kept telling me I was an 'ashin' color and I began to shake violently and go in and out of consciosness. It was at this pooint after I drank some water that I began to feel better. I decided to call my girlfriend and have her come take care of us as we both were completely out of our minds talking nonesense to ourselves and eachother. When my girlfriend got there I kept going in and out of consciousness untill finally I woke up the next day and felt ok. Over all, I'm glad I had someone responsible taking care of me. Pot is great on them but I need to pace yourself and know my limits. It can be a great experience (better than sex, ecstacy, cocain, anything imaginable) although it can be the most terrifying experience of my life. I like to be around good friends, they make it much better and its more fun.

796	0	a	One evening a friend of mine informed me that she had 3 grams of mushrooms sitting around, and proposed that we eat them. I agreed.
797	0	a	Being relatively inexperianced, we decided that I would eat one gram, and she would eat two. 
798	0	a	The important detail is that she said they were old - she'd had them sitting around for about 3 months.
799	0	a	We swallowed them around 11:30 or so. After we each had a drink, and then headed to a local club.
800	0	a	We hung around at the club for a while; there weren't a whole of people around. A little while after eating the mushrooms, I'd had some gas and a slight feeling in my stomach. Nothing else came. It was now 12:30, and I was feeling nothing. My friend reported no effects either.
801	0	a	We waited another hour or so, and still nothing. We concluded that they had been ineffective.
802	0	a	I later went home, and stayed up a more hours; they never did kick in.
803	0	a	Since it's pretty hard to take mushrooms wrong, and I have defintly felt effects off of one gram before, I only conclude that it was the age that effected them. I hadn't had a lot to eat, at no point did I vomit or anything, there shouldn't be any reason they didn't work. But did not. My friend, the next day, also reported never having felt any effects.
804	0	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
805	0	a	So before I even start this I gotta say this trip wasn't good, but it wasn't bad. It wasn't fun, but it wasn't boring. It was the most strange things I ever had happen and I'm gonna try and put it into the best words as possible.
806	0	a	I've always been interested in things that can help ones body and mind and I'll leave it at that ,not being a fan of substances that are bad for the body. I've smoked pot heavy through my teenage years I've done salvia once or twice and done mushrooms a few times not having any serious effects ,also never doing more that 2g (which I realized now was some weak mushrooms) and drink heavy on the weekend.
807	0	a	The past few months I've been interested in growing mushrooms and as my first time I didn't follow the correct colonizing/fruit temperature causing them to grow insanely slow. After growing a heavy yield and selling a few grams to friends I decided it would be a good weekend to try my grow. The plan was to have my friends who I wont name do them with me around our fire pit in the woods by my house where we always hang out in and drink(I figured it would be a great setting because of how much fun we always have and also growing up in these woods my whole life I feel very comfortable (because we were doing them at night). But as the time comes some of them back out because of work and girlfriends and I figured I wouldn't do them alone so I'll just drink (it was Saturday so it turns out to be and 4 friends M,A,M,D,T. M and A were originally going to do mushrooms with me but end up doing acid instead and talk me into trying my product anyway so I said fuck it I'm gonna take 1 mushroom to see how potent they were(this mushroom I took was maybe a gram at most) the worst I'm gonna get is a mood change and maybe a few patterns on the floor (I haven't ate in maybe 4 hours) and id also drink a few beers so we got our cooler and went up to the woods.
808	0	a	So we get to our spot and I eat this little thing and after maybe 20 min like usual I start getting very clear headed and trees look so nice. I also start getting the happy grin on my face and get waves of tingling in my arms and legs and as time goes on I also start feeling nauseous which I'm trying to ignore so I started looking out in the break of trees at the sky because the sun is almost completely down and I start seeing a purple orange blend of sky so I call M over who's starting to come up on his acid and we spend maybe 10 min starting at the sky mind blown about how nice it looks but than I started to get sick and dry heave so everyone lets me be for a few.
809	0	a	After this I'm still feeling nauseous but I start tripping hard, fast. My pupils are huge and my body feels like a feather, I keep waving my arms which are getting this tracer effect looking like 4 arms are following my one and I'm mind blown. My legs are like jello and I cant stand well which I thought was hilarious and start having a laugh episode. Its all fun from here but I'm still coming up for some reason as everything starts to feel warped.
810	0	a	After maybe 10 minutes of sucking on ice cubes from the cooler hoping the water would ease my stomach I'm just out of it and I start feeling very plain in my head like I'm not tripping but I still am and it shouldn't be this intense but I don't feel high so I go, not able to walk straight T and D have to hold me up as I attempt to grab a bud light lime(which I didn't even want) and the frosted mini wheat cereal I forgot I had hoping maybe it would calm me down, they bring me over to my seat. I I start getting scared with the feeling I start getting in my head ,I'm also not hearing a word any of my friends are saying and I'm trying to string together sentences which feels impossible. By this time its pitch black and the light from the fire is causing these 'sun streaks' in my eyes causing my to bury my head in my hands with these streaks lasting a few seconds with my eyes closed and all of a sudden out of no where it feels like when you get hit in the head and see stars or when you stand up too quick and get dizzy (this is what my brain feels like the rest of the night) I'm thinking I fucked myself this time. All I can remember for the next hour is getting these traveling lights everytime I look at the fire and and everytime I look into the darkness. I'm also being stuck in conflict with myself about weather I should take a drink of my beer or a frosted mini wheat and this leaves me sitting with the two in front of me for I don't even know how long just debating on what I want ,at the same time telling myself I have a good life and friends, While being scared about fucking my brain up telling myself it's just the psilocybin doing this. I than look out into the trees hoping to stop my thoughts and looking at the trees in the distance (it's completely black out) they start morphing into this huge spider god coming to get us and I'm looking at it and as my mood changes from scared to totally accepted of it being their I look over to the fire again and swear I shifted my seat a few feet to the left which leaves me confused as hell, than look back at my 'spider god' which is still their and now has baby spiders climbing around everywhere and I stare in amazement and out of no wear I get energy to stand up grabbing a stick out of the fire and I start walking back and forth, feeling like I'm a wizard and using it as a walking stick (it's completely on fire exept for wear I'm holding) feeling magic in the thing and pretending to blow stuff up by slamming it on the ground like I'm the wizard of this forest and these are the monsters you need to get through.
811	0	a	I than start getting over being scared and I feel fucking insane ( my pupils are huge, everything around my eyes and my eyes themselves are beat red and I got a sick smirk on my face) I still feel in my head like I got punched and I'm dazed and I start getting firewood ,throwing it in and talking to myself ,Blocking out what my friends are saying to me I'm talking to the plants I'm walking past like they were hanging out with us.  
812	0	a	After standing up for a while so proud of the fire I created which thinking back to it I'm shocked didn't burn down our woods I just feel out it and I feel like I smoked a shit tone of weed. I feel like this the rest of the night. After going home I call my cousin who's trying to calm me down cause I have no explanation on how this tiny ass mushroom I ate fucked me up so bad, he tells me a story about something similar that happened and the feeling in my head was probably blood pressure from getting a little overwhelmed from the visuals and it just made me tweak out the rest of the night cause of what the shroom chemical does mixed with it my slight panicking it. After trying to go to sleep(I'm wide awake but tired if it makes sense) I get this feeling every time I breath like I'm sucking in way too much air I eventually fall asleep waking up to feeling great with not the slightest feeling in my head like I did a drug/medicine whatever you want to call it
813	0	a	This is the best I can do putting my experience into words. Ovcourse I left out allot of things but this is for the most part how it went
814	0	a	Will I ever do mushrooms again? Yes. In the day time. 
815	0	a	Do I have words for what I experienced off of such a small little dose?
816	0	a	I also didn't gain anything from it which next time I'm looking to do but the only thing that stayed with me is knowing I have good family and friends and being happy with my life which was the one thing that stood out to me the whole trip.

819	0	a	This all began when I ordered some mushrooms from a dutch website (sorry but they no longer provide this interesting service) I recieved my package and examined the twisted fungi with awe. Me and a mate were to trip together that summer but I wanted to try them out right there. It was about 6pm in the summer and I had an exam the very next day. 
820	0	a	I gulped them down with some orange juice. I hadnt eaten all day (doh!)My dad rang and I spoke to him on the mobile while pacing around my garden in the warm summer afternoon. My legs began to feel as if they were curling towards my head.somone had turned up the colour to full on my vision and I was realy enjoying walking. I said goodbye and ventured to the mirror (always a bad idea kids) my puils were HUGE and I got this 'what have u done to yourself?!' giggly feeling within. I retired to my bedroom.
821	0	a	I laid on my bed and stared at the ceiling. The white washed surface was suddenly twinkling with rainbow patterns, turning together, like clockwork. The patterns became three dimensional and it felt as if I were beneath a huge UFO with lights glaring down at me. I began crying in happiness at the beauty of all of this. My overriding feeling was that this was just too beautiful for me to see without working for it. Then my mum came home.
822	0	a	Dread began its creeping journey into my trip as I panicked, knowing my mum would know I was tripping. In she came.
823	0	a	Me:(panick She knows!!) No, no I'm just tired (turning over) night mum.
824	0	a	Mum walks out. I open my eyes. Instinctively (just go with me on this) I told my bedroom light to get darker. And it did. Fascinated I instructed it again: 'darker!' and it bloody worked! I realised I  was in an entirely warped world. Nothing could be trusted. I lit a cigarette. I stared at it (trippers, NEVER EVER should stare!) and after some time it began to slowly curve and bend all by itself until I was smoking a completely curled cigartee.oh lord.
825	0	a	I zoned out then and began having dark and paranoid thoughnts that I was ill and dying of imagined diseases and illneses. Fear grabbed me from below and pulled me down itno its sticky world. I was scared and tripping even harder. In desperation I called a friend. He calmed me down and we chatted randomly for ages. I kept saying to myself I was okay and it was over and I wasnt tripping anymore. It seemed to work and soon I was nealry fine again. 
826	0	a	The following weeks me and a mate tripped in the local meadows and forests. MUCH better fun. It was better getting close to nature and DOING something. Instead of staring and dwelling on wierd or paranoid thoughts.

828	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), First Times (2), Difficult Experiences (5), Alone (16)
829	0	a	Doing mushrooms was something that I had considered, though never actively pursued. Of course, a friend of a friend managed to get some, inquired as to whether or not I was interested, and in fact, I was. Its late April, so the sun goes down around 8ish where I live. It had been a rather dreary day, mostly overcast, but still reasonably warm (mid 70's). I didn't eat anything for about six hours, and around 5 I ingested the mushrooms, stems and caps.
830	0	a	I felt the same for about twenty minutes, when I started to notice a substantial change in perception. Everything stayed the same in terms of color and luminosity, but the speed at which I viewed my environment slowed down. This was an honestly uncomfortable state, especially at first. I felt a bit queasy, and just overall jittery, with my skin tingling a good amount. After a while though, I started to feel very energetic, and strange as it may sound, very powerful and very comfortable within my own skin, all most a very confident stage. I would call it a frenzied imperative to move! I decided that I needed to get out of my house at this point and I put on my very beautiful pair of Dior Homme sunglasses (very well constructed from plastic, and most importantly, in neutral tones! neutral tones are a very nice compliment to the experience.) I started to walk towards the downtown of where I live (a moderately sized college town, laid out in a grid pattern). I must have walked several miles when I decided to call a close friend who I am very comfortable with and who I knew would 'go with the flow'. She and I and a very odd friend of hers (who appeared to me to be emanating a godly, prophet like radiance) walked several more miles, out of downtown, past the local 'justice center'/jail, over some train tracks, and into a very sketch part of town. At this point I started to feel very queasy, worn out, and I almost vomited. I called another friend of mine, who nicely enough dropped me picked all of us up and drove them to their house, an me to mine. I was feeling better at this point, and I smoked a bowl of pot with some friends when I got back home. This really mellowed me out, especially after the intense physical exertion of earlier. Over the rest of the night, through varying circumstance and context, I found myself walking several more miles.
831	0	a	In all, I would say it was a great experience, maybe not one I will ever do again, but certainly worth every ounce of it, even the uncomfortable stages. I was happy I drank a lot of fruit juice, dressed classy and confidently, and was with people who were willing to adapt with me and most importantly, WENT WITH THE FLOW!

833	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), First Times (2), Various (28)
834	0	a	I have only done mushrooms twice so far. My first experience was good, but not great. My second was one that I will never forget. It was me, my boyfriend and my two roommates that ate the mushrooms. We each had close to 3 grams. About 2 hours after we ate them, none of us were feeling the same as we were the first time we tripped. We had a great body buzz but other than that, nothing special. The others that I was with started being negative, talking about how they weren't feeling anything and the shrooms must have been bad. I started feeling kind of down because I was experiencing more visuals and was tripping more than they were. So I decided I wanted to go outside.
835	0	a	I was standing outside smoking a cigarette and just staring up at the sky. It was nighttime and the sky was a bright purple color to me. It was dark but at the same time everything was so clear, I could see every little detail. My roommate and boyfriend came outside to check on me and they were telling me that they weren't tripping at all. This made me feel so sad, I just wanted to be by myself and drift off into my own world. I walked back inside to the computer to listen to some music. I don't remember actually making it to the computer but I do remember coming inside. My boyfriend told me that I spun around in the computer chair and then passed out, face first onto the floor. I was only out for a few seconds but it felt like hours.
836	0	a	I was having the most amazing trip. It was definitely the best experience of my life. I had a total out of body experience, I was up in the sky, the bright purple sky. I wasn't just in the sky; I was part of the sky. I felt so peaceful but it was all so intense at the same time. I felt powerful, like I was part of something bigger than me. I felt powerful, like I was part of something bigger than me. I do believe that I found my inner happiness. I must have turned on some music before I passed out because I heard it in the background. Then I heard someone yelling my name, shaking me and trying to wake me up. I know now that it was my boyfriend but at the time, I felt like the sky was talking to me, welcoming me. (This probably sounds dumb to most people, my boyfriend and roommates don't understand at all.) Anyways, I eventually started to wake up but I was so confused. I didn't recognize my boyfriend at all and I was scared that I had a stranger standing over me. I didn't recognize my house either. It was so confusing but I finally realized where I was. Once I got up, I drank some water and felt amazing. My boyfriend was so stressed out and worried about me, he didn't believe me when I told him how great it was. This truly was a life changing experience. I feel like a completely different person now. I'm not sure what caused me to pass out but I definitely had an amazing trip.

838	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Glowing Experiences (4), Small Group (2-9) (17)
839	0	a	I have experimented with a moderate amount of drugs in my life, but have never done a powerful psychadelic like shrooms before.
840	0	a	So some kid I am pretty good friends with told me he was getting shrooms this weekend and asked me if I wanted any. I said 'sure'. So I got the shrooms, but I was a little confused when it turned out to be a piece of chocolate, which he said had the equivalent of 3.5 grams or an eigth ounce of shrooms mixed in with it. I was a little bit skeptical, but I went ahead and ate half of it when I got home, thinking I'll see what the effects are and decide if I want to eat the other half.
841	0	a	About 40 mins into it, I start to see visual distortions. Everything that was supposed to look rectangular, looked spherical. Walking became a little difficult. It felt like I had to put effort into making sure I make the right muscle contractions with each step.
842	0	a	I layed in bed and watched tv for a little bit, having just minor visual distortions. For some reason everybody on tv looked like their head was a big rubber halloween mask. I felt like thy were all in on a hugesecret, and were trying to exclude me from it. I had an overwhelming feeling of 'malevolence'
843	0	a	It felt like my mind and body was being controlled by a malevolent spirit. I felt like I was superior to everything, and this whole world was a joke. At one point I stood up and walked around my room. My legs felt like they were robotic ,and I struggled to walk. I also noticed I was experiencing bad muscle pain. I picked a shirt off the ground, and started laughing at how small and insignificant it was in the grand scheme of things. I then started trying to rip it in half. I struggled hard to rip it for a little bit, getting pissed off at it. It felt like the madder I would get at the shirt, the stronger I would get. I eventually ripped part of the shirt, and the noise it made scared me. I turned off the lights and jumped in bed, trying to find the most comfortable position, because of my muscle pain. I stayed in that position for probably about half an hour, feeling like my soul was completely dead. It just felt quiet, empty, emotionless. All I could do was lie there and feel 'dead'. Then I suddenly got an urge to sit up, and acted on the urge. I still was having visual hallucinations but I didn't feel dead anymore. I actually felt like I was reborn. I started laughing, feeling so good to be alive. I felt like calling all my friends and family telling them how happy I was, but I decided it probably wouldn't be a good idea. The visual hallucinations and body aches went away gradually over the next few hours. I didn't have any bad aftereffects. In fact, for the whole week afterwards I felt great. I felt like it 'defragged' my brain, making it run little better, and gave me more mental energy. I think there also could be some residual long lasting positive effect on my brain.

846	0	a	A little background on me, I am not this crazy psychonaut, nor take a lot of substances, before this experience I've only taken LSD two times (150ug and 300 ug) and shrooms also two times (1.5 grams and 2.0 grams). This was that experience that people usually say 'I need to level up my dose and see what happens'.
847	0	a	My mind set for this experience was of trying to make my visuals come to life, as I never got much visuals like people usually have, fractals, see a lot of diferente colors. I heard that having a more spiritual mindset and moving energies would get me more visuals.
848	0	a	About one week before the experience I went to pick some shrooms with my brother, he wanted to have an experience and I know where to get it. So I picked about 75 grams of shrooms, and prepared 50 grams of fresh shroom in a brew. He drank about 2/5 of the total amount (there was about 30 grams brew left), had a mild experience. As for me I didn't have much time to appropriately trip, so I stored it for another few days until I was sure I had the time, the right set and setting.
849	0	a	I wasn't so sure that the tea would still work as in fear of losing it's potency over time in the fridge. So I drank the whole tea expecting to have only a mild experience.
850	0	a	I started to meditate and try to equilibrate my energies as I prayed to the gods and spiritual friends to guide me during this experience, during this time I was in my bedroom, with only a notebook screen playing some chakra healing music. This lasted only 10 minutes as my wife disturbed me when a few people arived at my house (her mother, and her cousin's wife). I didn't go out to see them as I knew I was coming up and I was already feeling the effects. My body was starting to feel heavy, I was yawning every two minutes and felt really sleepy, my heart was starting to race a little bit. My body was starting to feel heavy, I was yawning every two minutes and felt really sleepy, my heart was starting to race a little bit. So I laid down, held my notebook and started to listen to different kinds of music to calm me down and ground me throughout this comeup.
851	0	a	I already felt the effects but I wasn't on the onset yet, my thoughts were speeding up, I could already feel the time dilation, I started to hear a music playing in my head (there was no music playing by this point as my wife asked me to stop the music. In my head I could hear clearly the music Roar from Katy Perry, I don't like pop music, but this is what was playing. So I started to get a little bit anxious and kinda depressed. I tried to watch cartoons like I usually do while on LSD but it was unsucessful as I wasn't understanding what they were saying. So I tried to watch the vÃ­deo clip from the music that I was hearing in my head. It was amazing to watch that vÃ­deo. After this my wife called me to help them to grate some parmesian cheese, I wasn't in the mood to do anything by this point and the trip wasn't so fun. But as I know that by changing the set that you're on, the trip also takes a turn.
852	0	a	I wen't to help them however I was too scared to handle the grater it was too loud and too noisy, I kinda look like I was cutting human bones. So, I stoped and sitted on a wooden chair and just listen to them gossip about other people, this made me really happy and got me in the right mood, so I started to clean with a broom a part of my backyard that was too trashy, this also made me happy and realise that I don't need to be confined in a room to have a nice experience. All this time they didn't notice that I was on something, not even my wife (I told her later and she didn't belive me haha).
853	0	a	As I finished clean the backyard I just stood there listened to their conversation and I started to get noticible visuals for the first time, I saw their faces change a little bit, the surrounding were starting to get this bright light energy to the lines that defines the edges of things, however when I looked directly it would dissapear. My wife's face looked funny and I was laughing so naturally while they gossiped about thing and told amusing jokes, one of the best feelings ever. There was no music, just conversation with normal people.
854	0	a	They decided to go to a street Market close to my house. I wasn't sure that I wanted to go, when I already decided that I didn't want to go that sadness struck me again and I changed my mind and decided to go with them. I got inside the car and for a few moments I thought that I was inside a really fun spaceship, with all the sounds, the wind blowing on my face. We arived at the street market and as we walk through it everything sounded alien, I couldn't understand what people were saying, I also had a hard time to know what money meant, as my wife asked me if something was expensive and I wouldn't know the answer. I didn't know what monetary values meant, this also happened on acid. There were a few kids running I thought that they were those ET's that you would see in movies a little green, gray or blue. I saw a few animals meat hanged and it really but really made that street market look even more alien than before. 
855	0	a	By this point I didn't recognize my mother in law nor my wife's cousin wife. I only knew who my wife was and that I just needed to follow her. I couldn't remember my name or who I was. I only knew who my wife was and that I just needed to follow her. I couldn't remember my name or who I was. 
856	0	a	We got home and everybody else but my wife left. By this point I had no idea or conception of anything but time and space and how to use my robotic body. I felt trapped inside my body. And we still had some chores to do that day, we needed to finish cleaning our backyard and garage as it was filled with large wooden slats  and rocks. So, I need to throw those wooden slats away, I wasn't sure if I could ever lift it, but I don't know from where I got this incredible strength lifted it and threw it to the other side of the wall, I did this to every single wooden slat that I would find in my way.
857	0	a	I showered and started a very slow comedown, we ordered pizza and just sat in our bed watching cartoons, this was very pleasant. I wasn't sure if I knew who I was and started to think that I've gone mad permanently, but it would drift away in a few seconds.
858	0	a	I was almost back to baseline and was feeling really sleepy. So I slept the rest of the day (it was about 09.00 pm).
859	0	a	Felt really good, peaceful, happy, loving, solved a few problems that I had at the time of social anxiety and antisocial manners. Felt a little paranoid I don't know why.
860	0	a	Everyday at night I would be a little paranoid about losing my mind, however felt happy throughout the day.
861	0	a	Felt paranoid about my sanity every single day, had a few strange thoughts that I knew that it wasn't mine.
862	0	a	Started working at this UBER call center, got success at my results, got a promotion, got back to normal state of mind, no paranoia.
863	0	a	Did mushrooms again with my friend, 50 fresh grams with lemons and 400 mg of piracetam. This was my last and most intense and crazy trip ever.
864	0	a	NOTES: Throughout the whole paranoid state I kept repeating this sentence that help me to regain control of whatever I thought I lost: 'My mind controls my body not the other way around'. Also read a lot about spiritism, chakras, energys, astral projection.

867	0	a	I had taken shrooms before, but I had never really tripped that hard.  Everytime I dosed I would just feel very light and happy and lights would seem brighter than normal.
868	0	a	I was at my friends house and we had just purchased an 1/8 for 50 dollars.  It was in the form of a chocolate heart, which I had never seen before.  I always ate caps.  
869	0	a	The strangest part about this trip was how fast it kicked it.  I ate the chocolate, which tasted strange but good, and probably 10 or 15 minutes later I started to feel different.  I got extremely nauseous and thought I was going to throw up.  When I got up to get a trash can (just in case) It was difficult to walk because I had tremors in my legs.  It was difficult to do anything because of the tremors, but it wasn't that unpleasant.
870	0	a	For about 30 minutes while I was coming up I barely moved.  I lied down on my friend's bed and tried to get comfortable, but it was difficult because of the shakes, nausea, and anxiety.  I remember being afraid to be alone and constantly telling my friend not to leave me.
871	0	a	After a while, the nausea started to subside and I began to feel good.  I felt light and a little hyper.  Around this time my friend took a picture of me and flash from the camera looked amazing.. It looked like lightning.
872	0	a	I wasn't hallucinating much with my eyes open, but when I closed my eyes I saw the most beautiful things.  It's so hard to describe.  I saw colors that could never be recreated in nature.  I saw strange visions like butterflies flying behind my eyelids with thousands of blinking eyes in their wings.  I remember being overwhelmed and wanting to cry with joy because it was so beautiful.
873	0	a	About an hour and a half later, I was peaking.  I hadn't opened my eyes in a while because of the visions, and that's when I heard the voice.  There was a man in my head!  Or so I thought.  He told me many things.  What I remember most though is when he first spoke to me.  He said, 'I am the Shaman.  These visions are a gift from me.'  I wasn't scared of the voice.  In fact it was very comforting.  I talked back to the shaman, but in my head.  I called it speaking to him telepathically.  I don't remember much about our conversation, but when I 'woke up' from the trance and opened my eyes I felt so happy.  I felt like I belonged in the world and I finally understood why I was here. I felt like I belonged in the world and I finally understood why I was here.  It was a wonderful feeling.
874	0	a	Later when I was coming down I went outside with my friend to smoke a cigarette.  It was night time and I couldn't remember the world ever being so beautiful.  I watched the trees, and the stars, and the sky, and mostly the moon.  I felt so connected with nature and people and the earth.  It was an extremely positive experience that I will never forget.

877	0	a	It was one of the lst days of summer. It was dark out and me and my freind brad where going to see a fight that was happening down at the local ranch,it was like a skids against preps sort of thing. Before we left to watch Brad pulled out a little bag of shrooms about 8 grams from the look of it. Me and brad have had many shroom trips together and enjoyed tripping together every other weekend. 
878	0	a	We consumed the mush at around 8:00 and we sat on the side of the hill until about nine. I could feel of a body high coming on and we decided being at a fight on mushrooms was a very stupid idea, so we walked to a friends house nearby. On the way the body high had increased and my mind was becoming a bit blurred a dog behind a fence sounded like a vicious beast and I began to feel a bit anxious. We got to my friend ray's house and chilled out in his room for a little bit but I began to feel the drugs taking hold. The Peircings in my face began to feel strange, however I shrugged these feelings off because anything made of metal always feel weird on mushrooms. It was about 10:00 when I began to feel really sick and I decided that I had to leave rays room. I could feel the spins coming on strong and as much as I tried to relax I just was not able to keep my mind settled down. We left ray's house and I began to feel a whole lot better but I looked at brad and he did not seem to be having the best time.
879	0	a	We decided that the river would be cool to go down to and we could sit on the walkway and smoke some weed. At about 12:00 we made it to the walkway and we decided to stand around and have a smoke really quickly. BAD IDEA. We were all standing around completly ripped out of our skulls. Brad was in the middle of a sentence....took a drag of his smoke...and fell completly face first into solid concrete. At first he just lay there in a pile on the floor but soon he got up and began to crawl around making the strangest noise I have ever heard. I flipped him over and had a look at his face, half of one of his front teeth had been knocked out in the fall and there was blood all over his face. ( I was flying by this time so there might not have been as much blood as I thought). After about ten minutes of rolling about and spitting blood up brad instantly switched back to himself and began began laughing at himself and saying how weird that was. We went back to my house and cleaned brad up and watched batman begins (which was crazy). Towards the end of the trip brad had another bad spill in the bathroom, he fell through my shower and completly destroyed evrything around it.There was a major burnout and I my body began to move and stretche. It had been a crazy night but nothing to make me not want to zoom occasionly.

882	0	a	I did mushrooms for my first time on friday. We found the best way to eat them!!! We melted a couple chocolate bars in a pot on the stove and bud busted an ounce of mushrooms and added them in, then we poured them into icecube tray and freeze them for a bit, then chow down, I didn't even taste them at all. Anyways, I ate 2 chocolate cubes which had 2.2 grams in each. After about 20 mintues I started to feel warm and buzzed like I was drinking.
883	0	a	I took a seat on the couch with my friend Megz and I started to trip. There was a sparkly design on everything it was amazing. The house I was at, had 2 kids sleeping in it... And when they woke up they were super hyper and were running around the house. The little boy was on the floor rolling around like he was seizuring and his face was all bloody, and his sister was sitting on the floor crying tears of blood... When I came outta that mind trap I felt my high lower a little and I was kinda confused as to why I would see something so horrifying... But then I started yawning... Non stop and just getting higher and higher every time, I didnt come down even a little bit until 6 hours later! I remember not being able to talk... And when I did... It was scary because I couldnt feel my mouth or control what I said.
884	0	a	My friend kept asking me how fucked I was and all I could say was 'I'm so fucked... I cant tell if I'm talking', and from then on we didnt say another word to each other, just sat and tripped in our own minds. I remember thinking if everyone else there was trippin out to... And how they were having such casual conversations when I could barely talk. All of a sudden I got the urge to go to the bathroom... Phew that was a long walk... As soon as I closed the door and turned around I seen myself in the mirror and I jumped back towards the door... My eyes were pure black... I couldnt even see the white... And I was wearing a black shirt so I looked so dark and scary... I stared into my eyes for what felt like 10 mintues but was truly only a second or two, and it scared me but I couldnt turn away... Finally I grabbed the doorknob and booked it back to my comfy seat on the couch, I couldnt go to the bathroom for the rest of the night because I was scared to see myself in the mirror. Everyonce in awhile I would touch my face and there were tears on it, and I couldnt tell if it was from yawning so much or cause I was crying... And I did feel like I had been crying... So I dunno...
885	0	a	Anyways, I will definately do mushrooms again... And make sure I listen to good music because a couple marilyn manson and korn songs came on and it totally brought my good mood down...

888	0	a	I am a fairly experienced drug user, having smoked marijuana frequently, and a few other binges (i.e. ecstacy and cocaine). My night basically revolved around getting some wet but things happen and shrooms came up.
889	0	a	After waiting a few hours my shrooms had finally arrived at 11:45ish. Me, my friend K, D, and Z all ate up our shrooms and waited for the first effects. Within ten minutes the body high kicked into gear and giggling as well. We all started to play a video game and i started to feel rather strange as did my friend K and we both let go of the controlers and handed them over. We both picked comfotable spots and just stared at the ceiling which was needless to say very different. The roof began taking on shapes and patterns and what seemed to be a cloud forming where the roof was. Although this was bizzare it's something like you would see if you took DXM. The first thing that really started to make me trip was my friend K, he looked at me and said 'how do you feel' and his voice sort of driffted off as the last words came out of his mouth. His face was like something I had never seen before, very disstorted, he kind of looked like Frankenstein and sort of cartoonish. All four of us took a walk downstairs so we could try to trip harder. 
890	0	a	Being anywhere else from the moment I took the shrooms was like a new world. As the minutes went buy laughter filled the air. I didn't know why they were laughing but I couldn't help but laugh at the things I was seeing. It's about an hour and a half or so into the trip and I was loving it as well as my friends.
891	0	a	The best way I can describe shrooms to a person who wants to try them for the first time is, one doesn't see anything that's not there. One sees visuals from what's already there. For instance, I went to the bathroom and started to do number 2, but what caught my eye was how the bathroom would change color from light to dark to light. And this pattern on the wall was literally moving, I couldn't look at it without it moving or me just laughing histerically. It was now about 2:30 am full face tripping at this point, everything was disstored and I mean everything, cats, people, furniture, you name it it was fucked up. But unlike other trip stories you read or may read I did not really have deep thoughts or life changing experiences instead I had a 100% visual trip which was awesome.
892	0	a	So much more happened that night as far as visuals go, but I want to cut this a little short and leave you with this. Shrooms, as long as one has a good mind set and doesn't expect the worse it'll be fine.

894	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
895	0	a	I've tripped about four times before and each was beautiful and strange in it's own way. I have been trying to find shrooms in my area for about a year and when a friend told me about some I bought an 1/8 without hesitation. I took the day off of work today and at 7:35 a.m. Est I ingested the 1/8 (on an empty stomach). I have no problem with the taste at all.
896	0	a	At around ten past 8 I started to feel a body buzz and the walls began to breath a little but that subsided after a few moments. I then laid back to relax for the come up. The come up was a little bit awkward but the body buzz was really good and I had a feeling of euphoria. After about 20 minuets I put on my headphones and began listening to the song 'rubber world' by local syracuse band Ted Eddison. They are incredible. Anyway, I definately experienced the time dilation thing as mere moments of the song seemed like entire episodes or events. I can't really say that I experiences closed eye visuals, but I had these strange and lovely daydream experiences. I have vivid daydreams anyway, but these were tinged with colorfull psychedelic accents. I felt a split in my self at times. Part of me felt completely sober while another part was free to play and daydream. Part of me felt completely sober while another part was free to play and daydream. I realized that this wasn't entirely true as I got up to go to the bathroom and every time I saw my reflection in the mirror I thought 'this fucking guy again.' Whenever I had that thought I would chuckle. The effects subsided a bit around 10 am. I listened to 'inward journey: east and west' by Joseph Campbell. It was enlightening and funny at times.
897	0	a	It's now 11:19 am and I am coming down gently. I still have a happy buzzy feeling and music still sounds trippier. Overall it was a very mellow trip and I had a great time. I will do it again maybe in 6 months or so.

900	0	a	One night me and four other friends desided to take part in a journy together. Unfortunately we got seperated and we were forced to go home. Well after an hour long giggling sesh my friend bunked off and left me alone. I turned off the light and then tried to slip away, oh I did slip away, into the truth. I saw the creation of the universe unfold and then end, and then begin again, and then end, and then begin again. Then a voice told me that this is the two energy states of 'this' universe, it has begining (1) and end (2), and the voice was part of a collective of omnipitant information telling me the ironic plight of omnipitancy. They have to live in a universe that they've seen happen over and over and over 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2. They have (we have) been doing this forever and will be doing this forever.Sort of like Groundhogs Day. They also told me that this is one of infanite other universes, each haveing different rules. I know there are other people that know this to, a comprehension beyond any.
901	0	a	They told me that this world is not real, its a simulation, to see what would happen if they linked with another universe, and this link is our brains, and to open this link is mushrooms. I will send this again, once i refine it, I need more time to shrugg it off, I want someone to email me to tell me that they have experienced it aswell. 'Robert.W' the one who wrote The Meeting with the Mushroom, said something similar. All I know that this is not reality. We are a device.

904	0	a	As twins my brother and I partook on a mushroom experience that was unique to us in that we experienced a strong psychic connection to one another.  This was our first trip on mushrooms together.  Living in the mountains we took to nature with the mushrooms.  These particular ones were very small and looked different from others I've used.
905	0	a	We ate these small dried and duffy shrooms in our beautiful surroundings of pine trees, large rocks, and sounds of a waterfall.  That sunny day nature inhaled us into its lung and we pulsated in rhythm with our surroundings.  We became one with everything, there was no separation.  As the trip progressed and revealed to us its patterns and sheer love, we found we no longer needed to talk to one another.  We no longer needed to discuss anything in a verbal manner.  We were synchronized, our movements to different areas of the forest and the places we stopped to absorb, became understood in us both.  We didn't have to ask each other which direction to move, where to lay down, how each other were doing with this trip, if we needed water or not.  It was understood with out any hesitation.
906	0	a	This experience with my twin brother was novel,  we have used many substances with one another over the years, but have not been so psychically synchronized on such a complete level as our first mushroom experience together.  Not even acid has done that for us with such completeness.

909	0	a	This was my first time trying any sort of psycoactive drug, aside from caffiene, and I had high hopes for what I would experience. My boyfriend is experienced in this kind of thing, so he suggested we go somewhere away from various annoyances, and people who could make it a bad experience for me. They were pretty strong, even though they were mostly cap. About half an hour after I ate them, (on an empty stomach) I started feeling my mind moving a little quicker, and I found it extremely difficult to stop talking to my boyfriend about what I was seeing. I remember my state of mind being very happy and I felt a sensation of almost childlike innocence and curiosity. A lot of things that I saw, I now realize, were things I had already thought of in the past, but only existed as ideas, and the substance was actually making them visible through my eyes. I felt like everything that had a form deserved respect, like snow, trees, clothes, and shoelaces. After about 1 1/2 hours, the intense hallucinations really slowed down, and I began to feel very mellow, which I enjoyed, and everything was just groovy. I would definitely consider doing them again in the future.

912	0	a	I was nervous about trying mushrooms, but my friend was going to give me some for free, and it was a good deal. We went to an outdoor mall, and ate them in my friends car. They were good with chocolate. A bit odd taste, but not as bad as I was expecting.
913	0	a	I started feeling really happy. Which for me, is a rare thing. It was good. We sat down to eat, and I really wasn't hungry, but I was obsessed over making sure to get a soda. Then, I barely even drank it.
914	0	a	We left the restaurant and sat on a bench, talking about the world, and what if it were like a video game, or what'd it be like to be an ant and other things like that. I really thought about a lot and decided a lot about my life. I got that really deep trip that made me a bit secluded.
915	0	a	I didn't get paranoid at all, I was fine going up and talking to people. Colors were multiplied just as I had read about. I was worried about having a bad trip, but I was prepared about what to do. I knew you weren't supposed to be around people, but it wasn't bad. I actually enjoyed talking to people.
916	0	a	Overall, I didn't want it to end. I was so peaceful, and sure of life. My self-confidence was extremely high.

921	0	a	I did not test these compounds before ingesting.
922	0	a	Trip: I ingested 1.5 g of the mushrooms at 12h39. Within twenty minutes, my stomach started to feel heavy. Ten more minutes and I started to feel loose. Time was becoming distorted. 
923	0	a	At 13h40, I felt tired but not enough to fall asleep. I took a bath for about fifteen minutes. My closed eye visuals were intensifying with each minute. My body is beginning to feel hot and clammy. When I got out of my bath, I started to watch My Neighbor Totoro. To my surprise, I had a great deal of mental clarity. While my opened eye visuals were not too intense, all my colors we richer. When the credits were rolling, I smoked a bowl and then went for a drive. 
924	0	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
925	0	a	Driving on any kind of drug is not recommended. However, I could not sit still any longer; I had to explore. The road I decided to take was a curvy, mountainous one. It felt as if I was on a rollercoaster. The only reason why I decided to drive was because I still had mental clarity and the only visuals I had were closed eye visuals. As I was driving around, I smoked my second bowl. Before I went home, I stopped at the grocery store to pick up supplies for my dinner. One of my friends was my cashier. She was surprised to see me out while on shrooms. 
926	0	a	When I got home, I started to make my dinner immediately. I was making pasta with garlic bread and a fruit bowl for desert. I didnÂt eat too much of it. By this time it was 16h30. I started to feel normal again. This prompted me to take more shrooms. This time, I took 2 g. Similar to above, I started to watch a movie. Instead of it being My Neighbor Totoro, it was HowlÂs Moving Castle. For some reason, near the end of the movie, I just started to cry. I could not stop the crying for three hours. I sat on my couch, alone, in the dark for three hours crying. The closed eye visuals continued to intensify to an overwhelming extent. I forced myself to sleep. When I woke up, I felt normal again.
927	0	a	Overall, while my trip was emotional strenuous, I had a positive experience.

930	0	a	In three seperate setions, in which I participated in the sacrament of the flesh of God (Magic Mushroom)and the flower of the tree of life(marijuana) I experienced surges of energy comming from the base chakra and crown chakra, meeting at the heart chakra. It was as though the whole universe had collapsed upon me.
931	0	a	Then, one day, I fell in love. It was a kind of manic agape in which I emersed myself for three months without the object of my love. 'There is no completeness without sadness and longing', don Juan. Then the great release occured.

933	0	a	It was New Years Eve 2000-2001 and there were 7 of us.
934	0	a	I ingested 3.5 grams of magic mushrooms, which took me about half an hour. Before that three joints were passed.
935	0	a	I sat cross-legged on the edge of a mattress, which we put on the floor so it would be possible for some of us to lie down.
936	0	a	Then something shoved a energetic star (assemblage point) into my head and, due to the impact, I died.
937	0	a	I remember having wanted to smoke a spliff but was unable to. I just fell on my back, my arms crossed over the chest and the joint hanging from the side of my mouth.
938	0	a	Then, all of a sudden, the room became filled with lava (hallucination) and I passed out, but a part of me was still aware.
939	0	a	Then I had a vision of a bubble bursting and all the space became filled, first with smoke, and then with a blackness, blacker then black. Then the tumbler cracked open my luminous cocoon( Tonal) and my spirit (Nagual) escaped to the stars. I remember having the bodily sensation of enormous heat of the star I entered followed by coldness of space as I moved to the next star. I traveled to three stars in my spirit body.
940	0	a	Then the pressure, the gravity of the universe made me rise from the darkness into a void that became filled, first with a lofty white light, which felt like being sand, and then it became very dense, like cement. Then I had a vision of four beings standing over me. Ah the white light.
941	0	a	Then I had a vision of being in front of a tower, which stretched high into the sky and at the top there was a beam of light emanating from that tower-like structure. The I heard a murmor and woke up fully conscious, feeling like reborn. The whole experience slipped into the unconscious and it took me years to fully comprehend it.

944	0	a	The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
945	0	a	I had never done mushrooms before and I bought them from someone that I knew pretty well.  My boyfriend and I had been dealing drugs for almost a year- everything from coke to acid to crystal.  I was a little uneasy about taking the shrooms, but I was assured that it would be just like an LSD trip.  I thought, ok, I can do this.  So I took these shrooms and went to a rave in the boondocks of a little missouri town.
946	0	a	I was beginning to feel it, and I was having a good time, then, all of a sudden, I got really light headed and fell to the ground.  I closed my eyes, hoping that it might help me feel better, but when I opened them back up and stood up, I found myself facing something that it completely unexplainable.  Before me I saw women and men, dressed as though they were in a ballroom, wearing tuxeodos and ballgowns.  There was an orchestra playing beautiful music.  I stood there in horror, because first, I didnt know where any of my friends were, I was staring into the faces of strangers.  Everywhere I looked, there were unfamiliar faces, scary faces, sad faces.  Everything began to get really fuzzy, and I passed out.  I woke up to loud screaming drum and bass music, with my head and shirt soaked in sweat, and I began to have mild seizures.  I shook so violently that my friends assumed that they should take me to the hospital, but considering the conditions that I was in, they decided against a hospital visit.  I shook violently for about 3.5 hours, and then I passed out again.
947	0	a	I awoke in a moving car, and I had to stop the driver so I could get out and puke.  I was scared, nervous, full of anxiety and fear.  I had no idea where I was, what had happened to me, and why I saw all those people in a ballroom.  I later found out that I started screaming for everything to go away, for the trip to stop.  I found out that I had vomited 4-5 times, and that my friends (god bless their souls) had taken care of me the entire night.  I have never been in a situation that has scared and scarred me as much as that one time of taking shrooms. I have not done them since, although I have had many opportunities.  Waking up in a ballroom when I thought I was at a rave, its a scary thing.  I didn't know where I was, who I am, and what has happened to me.

950	0	a	First time mushrooms: excelent and almost perfect experience!
951	0	a	I only ate 3 shrooms and alone, late at night.
952	0	a	I decide in counscious to try them (a small amount) which I believe I could control. And I could.
953	0	a	First, after some 20min, I began to feel a little increase in body temperature. Some funny thoughts and perceptions began also to appear. No nausea.
954	0	a	40min. I continue lied down and at home. Little light, soft music. My body started to feel a little more weird. Some allucinations start as well. I was never really afraid. Curious and sometimes surprise.
955	0	a	I heard beautiful chants of birds, cars and trucks far away, a angel calling (I did not understand what), an alien (which appeared from a picture) tried to communicated (was with a bad face), borders of objects waving and merging. But not strong hallucinations. The dose was small.
956	0	a	I shut down music. I was feeling somethings not correct, at several moments. I decide to go outside. First I was amazed by the cloudy and windy sky. I saw something moving fast up there. I saw also a bright red star behind a moving tree. 
957	0	a	This curious scenario, from my balcony, make me decide going really outside.
958	0	a	First, I walk by foot (this was about 70mins later). I was amazed by all silence at night, the appearance of trees, the beauty of flowers, the smells, the cat passing by. Only some rare appearances of cars annoyed me a little. People were also pretty strange to my mind. I was ok and happy. I decide to pick my bike. The cannals of water from the city were amazing! They seem vivid and alive with the water being pulled by the wind! The scenarios were almost divine by this time. Something otherwordly.  Life seemed a dream.
959	0	a	At this time, and during 2 hours (I did not care about time anymore), the peak continued. Hallucinations were not present. Only an altered (to beautifully) view and perception of reality. No really spiritual things as I dreamed but the experience was indeed fantastic!
960	0	a	I was like a child, seeing beauty in everything. I felt very self-confident but I did not speak to any of the few people I found on the streets. It was deep dawn. Sunrise was about to happen and I was more amazed with the sky. Although, I decide to return home.
961	0	a	I began experimenting on food and on music. Food was great only to taste (a few was enought). Music was awesome. I also found one of my colleagues awaked and talked entusiasticly with him.
962	0	a	It was a wonderful night. Perhaps the greatest ever (even the fact I was almost completely alone)

966	0	a	12:30 pm: Attempted to microdose a few caps of mushrooms and go to the store. On my way to the store, I began to shake and my hands on steering wheel began to have a fluid texture to them. Realized IÂd taken too much, so I decided to go home and finish the full dose, since I was already feeling it. 
967	0	a	1:00 pm: Took the rest of the eighth of mushrooms. Went upstairs to sit in silence and meditate into the experience. DidnÂt open eyes for, maybe an hour-and-a-half, two hours.
968	0	a	3:00 pm: ÂI Am Loved. I Am Vulnerable. ItÂs Okay.Â
969	0	a	4:00 pm: ÂThis is very intense. I am experiencing a lot. I am scared and want this intensity to end sometimes but I know I need this.Â
970	0	a	4:35 pm: ÂI am having a hard time coming back from this fear, but it is coming. In waves. Waves of joy and composure. Between crying on the floor of the bathroom. Man, all these feelings. When would have been a good time to experience these? It had to be now. It may as well have been now. It needed to come out in order for me to move forward. I am thankful for this opportunity to focus solely on these fears and anxieties Â what I keep calling them Â but really, these are just strong feelings needing to be felt that I have been neglecting. I feel light. I feel happy, again. I am just faced with weight, with seriousness, now, and that will pass eventually. Just feel it out. I can feel the grasp of these feelings releasing on me just through the simple act of acknowledging them.
971	0	a	5:00 pm: Bundled up and took a walk. Put headphones in and put on ÂInnerspeakerÂ by Tame Impala. Was able to process the experience and look at it in a more positive light. Felt the incredible feeling of control returning. Roommate met with me for a time and was the first person I was able to verbalize that I was feeling okay and coming to terms with the experience to. It was good to say it out loud and get it out of my head. Helped me solidify my feeling on the experience a little bit.
972	0	a	6:30 pm: ÂThis experience went totally different than I had expected, which seems to be one of the only predictable things about mushrooms Â unpredictability. It was really horrifying for a while, there. Felt like I had been swimming in anxieties and fear for an eternity. But I came out of it. I was able to have, acknowledge, experience, and surrender completely to those feelings, and come out of it. It really felt like I was never going to come out of that. Thank you for letting me come out of that. Thank you for letting me experience these emotions head on, instead of just being frustrated for having them. Thank you for giving me tears. Thank you for giving me tears. Thank you for providing me with the awareness of love in my life during this experience. Thank you for scaring the everloving shit out of me. It sucks, but itÂs good to have the shit scared out of you every once in a while. Man. I am really shaken up. I am glad to feel in control, again. I feel more in control, now, than before I started this today, actually. More in control of these feelings. Also more aware. It is still kind of hard to come to terms with. I still donÂt exactly know where this fear is coming from. But I certainly feel better equipped to manage it in the future. There was a beautiful moment of reconnection to my childhood self when I was crying in the bathroom. Crying brought me back to that wild, out-of-control feeling of having emotions you donÂt understand. I wanted to bury myself in my partnerÂs chest. In my MomÂs neck. I felt so alone for a time. Alone with this fear. Alone with this fear. But, IÂm not. IÂm not. I am not alone with this fear.Â
973	0	a	10:20 am, 11/7: Went to partnerÂs house around 7:00pm last night and felt so relieved. So happy and calm. I felt much lighter and her presence was incredibly refreshing and reassuring and helped reinforce the point I had reached in realizing that I am not alone. I felt like my thoughts were a little disjointed and disconnected at first. I noticed myself responding to things my partner was saying with slightly unrelated things, usually having to do with myself. Got quiet for a bit after calling myself out on that in my head. Her laying on me, on the couch, me half-asleep, stroking her hair, kissing intermittently and watching ÂCheers.Â Then, making love Â feeling the power of release and relief within both of us, lost in her eyes in my eyes. Then, holding her and her holding me as we collapsed into sleep together. I canÂt think of a better way to have integrated my mushroom experience and the message I was left with Â ÂI am not alone with this fearÂ Â than that. While I do still feel I am processing the experience, I am thankful for it and I feel like a weight has been lifted from me. 
974	0	a	It seems mushrooms introduce me to different sides of myself each time I take them. Whether that be the side of me that can feel pure joy, truly appreciate beauty, or feel the intensity of real fear and sadness.

977	0	a	Alright so one day I decided to try mushrooms, wanting to trip. I wasn't expecting the trip to be anything like it was. I ate my shrooms around 9 am and I started to feel the minor effects at around 9:30. But at around 10 am it hit me...I was tripping hard. While I was in my room I saw faces and weird designs and I thought my rug lifted up off the ground. Everything is like a dream and I had no sense of anything...its like one happy cartoon. I had thoughts in my mind and I was thinking of the most bizarre things ever, but they were positive.
978	0	a	Afterwards I went for a bike ride and I saw the leaves as faces smiling and I couldn't to this very day describe how happy I was when I was on the shrooms. Everything is like a dream and everything is so happy and its just amazing... I don't take anything for granted, I looked up at the sky and it was so pretty I could sit there for years. I also remember crying to the music I was listening to, it was so beautiful. Basically shrooms is a positive experience and it is hard to have a bad trip. The only problem about them is I had a stomach ache but it was well worth it. I also remember laughing my head off when my friend came over and hearing the song breathe in my head by pink floyd... It was the most amazing day of my life

981	0	a	The night started with my friend telling me that he had aquired mushrooms.  I do not eat mushrooms any more, I have had my fill of that drug, but I had a strong lust to trip.  I arrived at my friends place where he had taken a gram out of his bag, he then informed me that we were going to smoke the mushrooms not eat them.  I am willing to do anything once so I took a bunch of bong rips of it, we also smoked about 3 grams.  Right after my last hit of the mushrooms I felt alot more intoxicated than I did before I smoked it.  The feeling was that of when you start to come up after taking acid, the point before the trip starts.  This was what I call a trip tease, I felt this feeling so strong that I was sure that I was going to trip, but I did not.  The feeling is very good but leads you to believe that more is on the way, but there is nothing more.  The effects wore  off after about 1 hour, it was good but I would not do it again.  The taste is very unpleasing and leaves a nasty taste in what every you smoke it in.

984	0	a	Last night after reading a few reports about the Controversy of Smoked Mushrooms, a few friends and I decided to try it out.
985	0	a	We started smoking out of a Motorized Marijuana Water bong. I filled the bong with mainly Shroom caps. We took 3 Bowls each from the bong and then went back inside to see if, and how the effects would hit us. About 5 min. after returning to the house I found myself quite relaxed, with extremely minor breathing on the stucco ceiling. I was very giddy and found myself laughing at some unfunny things, like my friend Burning himself on a hot pan. It only lasted all of about 15-20 min. there was very minor time dilation, and minor loss of depth perception. If I am  wanting to trip, I will skip smoking shrooms, Because it is just more of a weak pot high (not the same, but I cant compare it to ingesting mushrooms) than shroom trip, and only resort to this if I am out of weed. Surprisingly it was very smooth, and left no burning in through after blowing out smoke, but while it is in the lungs it can burn a bit. I would like to try it mixed with pot, or hash, but that will most likely be another story.

988	0	a	Well, just thought I'd drop a quick line about some experimentative tripping I've been doing lately.  I've always found mushrooms to be a sort of unlocking mechanism when it comes to developing personal ability, whether it be learning to do something new, or simply bettering my understanding of something.  Learning to skateboard for example; all the critical milestones were passed while on mushrooms.
989	0	a	Understanding the music of J.S. Bach was something I couldn't begin to do when it was suggested to me that I should do so.  Mushrooms helped me.  I believe that most things just beyond our reach in a normal state are within reach under the influence of mushrooms.  I don't know whether it's a matter of improved focus, or abstract thought, or both, but I have noticed good results.  I find that muscular control is improved; muscles I didn't even know I had control of, I found I could manipulate.  Not to mention that music is interpreted at a higher level than merely the sounds produced, it becomes more of a language.  Certain music anyway.  I try practicing things while under influence, try understanding something (art, music, maybe even math), it works.  I use this golden tool, it's never too late to try.

991	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : Unknown Context (20), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), General (1)
992	0	a	The first time I ate mushrooms, my sister and I were young, inexperienced highschoolers with a drug background of little more than marijuana, tobacco, and coffee.  We had recently fallen in with a group of slightly older surfer-types who boasted a much more intimate familiarity with the variety of intoxicants out there in this world.  These guys entrusted us with an ounce of mushrooms before a weekend beach party or something, and gave us the go-ahead to experiment a bit beforehand, with no cautionary comments or the like.
993	0	a	Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
994	0	a	See this article on The Importance of Measured Doses.] 
995	0	a	So we ate these little dried shrooms by the fist-full, complaining about the flavor, yet digging our hands in for more wondering when we would feel high.  We took a walk in the mean time, and the shift in reality hit me suddenly around a half hour later in a grocery store, when I spilled my spare change all over some small children in line behind us.  I had no desire to buy anything.  We made our way to a park with our unwanted new possessions, and I felt, as the shadows of the trees stretched out across the grass, that the whole world was going dark and that I was missing something extremely vital to my well being.  This feeling did not ever leave.  My sister and I had quite the discussion over what it might be, and in retrospect I think it may have been my sanity.  
996	0	a	I have few memories after that.  I remember we made our way back to the grocery store, and spent some time sitting at the edge of that parking lot.  I watched  a womanÂs head turn into that of some sort of dog, and had to very forcibly, physically push it back into a human-shape with my ethereal hands.  My sister vanished for a while, leaving me alone with my skater shoes, which kept me close company for a while.  The voices of the universe were all speaking to me at once, flying in and out of my head in a great, black expanse of universe.  The parking lot spread out before me as great, calm, misty sea.  I was an old Chinese wise man who sat on the rocky shores of this sea, on an island that was half green, mossy cliff, and half smoke and steam.  People rowed their boats out to me for advice all the time.  As a matter of fact, someone was coming right then, I could see them, but what the hell was I going to tell them?  I couldnÂt make out the voices of the universe as they were all talking at once!  IÂd really done it, I must have taken some sort of drug, IÂd really destroyed my capacities as an oracle.  
997	0	a	It was a while before I left the state of believing Âthis is how it has always been, this is how it always will beÂ, essentially with a constantly changing perception of reality, none of which being the ÂactualÂ one.  Walking home was a trick, as my body had turned to jello.  I was safe in my room when I came down, feeling like my soul had stretched to great lengths out into the universe, and finally came all back into me like a closing flower blossom, leaving me content and happy with sanity.

1000	0	a	So first I will start with a backgrounder on how I came to be taking these for my first time.  While out one night drinking, my friend and I went to visit another friend.  While we were there he asked ÂHey, do you want 1.5g of shrooms?Â Me in my impaired state said ÂSure!Â I threw him a 10 and we were on our way.
1001	0	a	The next morning I woke up and found the tinfoil covered package, and remembered what it was and hid it in my room.  Being cautious, I consulted one reputable website in particular because it was coming up a lot on my Google searches. (and have been using it ever since)  I read all about how Vitamin C in the stomach gave you a stronger yet shorter trip, I thought Âwhat the hellÂ so I went and bought a 750ml Sunny D bottle, which I hadnÂt had since I was 10.  Also, that it takes about an hour to hit you, or in my case 1 hour, 10 minutes, exactly.  Also the same amount of time that it takes Dextromethorphan to hit me in.
1002	0	a	Armed with 600% daily intake of Vitamin C and 1.5g of Mushrooms, I told my friends and we set a date.  A date that we would all be around, a day with no school, and nice hot weather.  We chose Day in the Parking Lot; an annual event that my school has near the end of school in June.  There would be clowns, blow up slides, dunk tank, live local bands, ice cream, Guitar Hero II, friends, school mates, and sunÂand Marijuana, as we all smoke pretty regularly.
1003	0	a	The day arrived pretty quickly and I showered, got dressed, grabbed my one way shades and black shoulder army medic bag with all my special contents and paraphernalia.  After a 20 minute walk, I arrived at school and stopped, got seated in the forest right beside and started chugging the Sunny D.  Then, I unwrapped the mushrooms put them all in my mouth and started chewing.  Then almost gagging, they were so dry, crunchy and now in small pieces, it was an odd sensation.  I drank more Sunny D and swished it around in my mouth making sure to get all the bits from between my inner cheek and gums/teeth.  Then I walked inside, with a feeling of happiness and anticipation.  I can compare it to having an Alien egg inside of you, you know it is in there, itÂs not coming out and itÂs only a matter of time before ÂBOOMÂ.
1004	0	a	I took my time that morning so I arrived just in time to hang in the hallway and tell one of my friends about my ÂbreakfastÂ, then making her jealous of my time to come.  The bell rang to end first period and start the DITPL, I ran into my best friend, and he had a massive grin, knowing what I had done.  We went and met up with our other friends and they kept heckling me; ÂAnything yet?Â ÂOhhhh man this is gonna be awesome!Â ÂDrugs!Â  etc.  I told them I will tell them when.  After hanging around for a while we walked to a friendÂs house close by so he could grab some weed and Gin mixed drink.  
1005	0	a	On the way over walking down the path flanked by trees off the rear of school property I noticed my friendÂs hands were making coloured trails as he walked. ÂItÂs coming!Â I thought to myself.  Then we 4 went and smoked up. For the next while I just enjoyed looking at things, and found myself to be very relaxed.  We just wandered around the parking lot for another hour or 2, listening to bands, seeing who was there and who was on what.  Then we went and smoked up more.  By this time my high was totally different, while wearing my sunglasses, it was like I was in a bubble that was around me, and I had the feeling that I was seeing the world for what it really was.  The trees and plants looked so perfect and beautiful, the tarmac and grass was bouncy to walk on.  My friends were talking but I wasnÂt hearing them.  Right ripped and in my own little world we made our way back to school and wandered some more.  Then, we spent the next hour and a half standing there listening to the bands play.  Again, I experienced the feeling that I was inside a bubble floating around looking at everyone else.  For a while I was not even self aware.
1006	0	a	I canÂt remember walking home, all I know is that I left first because I wanted to play on my 360.  I do remember laying on the couch playing a demo for a WWII game and for a while I thought I was actually there, my neck hurt the next day from being so tense the whole time.  While playing Xbox the effect eventually wore off.
1007	0	a	Nothing too special happened, no gnomes running around or feeling like I have powers to control time or anything, besides it was a low dose but when mixed with the Marijuana it gave me a very nice outlook on things.  Since then I can now always see the world in a more beautiful way and appreciate art, mainly paintings a lot more even when sober.  I am very glad I did them.  It wasnÂt for another 2 months that I did them my second time, at a higher dose.  I will write about that too, and it will be a much shorter story.

1009	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Glowing Experiences (4), Various (28)
1010	0	a	Haloween night I took an eighth of shrooms and went trick or treating with some freinds. They were high but not on shrooms. I was the only one. This was my second time. I hadn't eaten anything for 24 hours before the ingestion of the shrooms.
1011	0	a	6:00-I eat the shrooms and hold them in my mouth for as long as possible.
1012	0	a	6:15-We leave my house. I begin to feel the effects. Mild nausea and my head feels a little odd. I feel somewhat giddy and we go in my back yard and they both smoke some nugs.
1013	0	a	6:20-We walk up to this girl's house that we were going to trick or treat with. We begin to walk around the nieghborhood.
1014	0	a	6:30-I started to feel really messed up. I was very giddy and couldn't stop smiling. I was very giddy and couldn't stop smiling. 
1015	0	a	7:00-The start of the peak of my trip. The world was like some kind of circus. All I could hear was what sounded like clowns singing 'The mushrooms,The mushrooms,The mushrooms' over and over again. Almost in a mocking sort of tone. Cars looked like hideous monsters and trick or treaters looked like axe murderers and goblins. I was having a blast because I knew in my head that it was just the shrooms. The lights from the houses looked like I was in some kind of video game.
1016	0	a	7:10- We started to walk home. The entire world (including the non-stop clown music in my head) would go into slow motion for a few seconds and then into fast forward over and over again.
1017	0	a	7:20-This is where it began to go downhill. We had to go back to that girl's house!! In front of her mom and dad! I was sitting on her couch and they were going through their candy. Her mom asked me why I didnt have any candy. (I had thrown it all over the place earlier) I COULD NOT answer her. It was like I didnt have a mouth. I just continued to stare hopelessly at the ground. Words cannot describe the way my body felt at the moment. She asked if we were drunk and my friend just laughed it off. She went to the door to greet some trick or treaters that had just rang the doorbell and I managed to stand and walk to my friends and tell them 'we have to get out of here right now. I CANNOT do this. We have to leave!' they thought up an excuse and we got out of there and went back to my house. 
1018	0	a	7:45-I could not talk to my parents so we snuck in my backyard and sat on my trampoline. I was FREAKING OUT> I kept saying OMFG what have I done. I am never doing this again. I am going to have to talk to my mom and she is going ot know what is up. I'm so fucked. Fuck fuck fuck. Omg. MY friends were trying to calm me down but I was just too fucked up.
1019	0	a	8:00-we called my girlfriend and she came and picked us up. We went to taco bell and I was trying to eat but I didnt have a mouth so it was kind of hard. I was still freaking out but I was just keeping to myself and could not talk to anyone. It felt like EVERYONE in the entire world was looking at me and laughing at me. Thats the best way to describe the feeling. 
1020	0	a	I went in the bathroom to be alone and away from everyone because thats all I wanted at the time. I went in the bathroom to be alone and away from everyone because thats all I wanted at the time. I still thought people were looking at me because I thought there were cameras in the bathroom. I stared in the mirror and my face began to turn into satan and it started talking to me. I have no idea what it said though. I started waving my hand around and it had these beautiful colorful trails on it. The whole world was lagging. I went back out into the restaurant and there was this family eating food. Heres the fucked up thing. I dont know if they were just in their halloween costumes or if they were just seriously scary looking fom the shrooms. One woman looked like a giant hulking beast and was shoveling tacos into her mouth by the dozen. I kept staring at her and she kept giving my this really dirty look. I would look at the walls and they were just changing colors and there were crazy patterns on them all. We left taco bell.
1021	0	a	11:00-we arrive at my house and I begin to come down from my trip. I stop seeing things and I begin to be able to talk coherently again.
1022	0	a	12:00 Its pretty much over. I feel much better. We smoke some shroom dust and some weed. I drank a little. Just enough to calm me down.
1023	0	a	2:00-I believe this is somewhere around the time I fall asleep. Wow. What a night.
1024	0	a	This may sound like a bad trip but that first hour and a half was one of the greatest times of my entire life. 2 hours of terror is a small price to pay for that much fun.
1025	0	a	I know where I fucked up and if I do trip again and I know what not to do:  Make sure I have the entire night planned out and Idont have to talk to any adults.

1027	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Public Space (Museum, Park, etc) (53)
1028	0	a	To begin I have eaten shrooms many times before and definatley felt effects.However smoking is entirely differrent.
1029	0	a	Just cleaned my pipe to get some resin and smoked about four or five tokes and got a good buzz, I also took some diphenhydramine 25 mgs. Since I'm out of weed at the time,but I grow my own shrooms so I decided to try smoking some.
1030	0	a	Packed the bowl with some shooms that werent to big but together weighed about a gram.I took the first toke and the smoke wasn't to bad. (kinda like scwagg weed and some shroomyness)Second toke and I start to feel weird and there is a pressure in my head and my hands look very odd.some colors are heightened. Third toke and there is definitely an effect Visuals,patterns,pressure in head and ears. Inability to think rapidly.
1031	0	a	The bowl is cashed in 3 tokes and now I have some CEV's like colors and shapes
1032	0	a	The effects are tapering somewhat but I'm still buzzed no more visuals either.

1034	0	a	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : General (1), Unknown Context (20)
1035	0	a	I have never been able to write with any linearity on 'cybin, except on subbs.  This trip was remarkable mostly for its lucidity.  I remained capable of clear, fairly-logical thought, and seemed able to move with more athletic grace than usual, and did not feel fatigue until well into the trip, maybe 6-8 hours after eating 8-10 fresh raw caps.  An altogether more manageable trip than I would expect to have on an equal dose of the usual mushrooms.  Be warned that I also felt more toxic aftereffects than on other 'cybins.  This may be due to their freshness, or to the fact that they were growing in cow dung and I didn't wash them.  I wrote this narration during the trip.   
1036	0	a	Goat-eyed now breathing in and out the whole verge of woods and desert, I see with predictable clarity and wonder the grey-green of ponderosas against vermillion cliffs and distant peaks. The blue bruise, the tawny dark-ringed cap, the nest of drying manure, all looked right. And my mood of maybe-fatal heedlessness suggested I should eat it. So I look back a half hour at my sad sad self in the just-grazed meadow, stooping under my pack and plucking the manure-flecked caps, and running my nail across the stems and watching them bruise blue, and taking a handful and half-chewing them and washing them down with my last Heineken, and now I am here at the verge of woods and desert in the riptide of profundity. The whole vista bleeds its color into me but loses no color. I name the scene turkeyhead because it is flushed with color that reveals a kind of sexual pulse not usually seen in trees and rock. I have my notebook, my walking food, my pistol, and I know circumstances back home brought me here with these things with the idea of writing a long note to the girls and stepping off some edge but I am scarcely able to maintain this thought. 
1037	0	a	This fungus does not feed the planning mind. This fungus reminds me what I knew all along, but continually forget in the city: that conclusions drawn from specific circumstances cannot logically lead to final solutions. That desperation in suffering in ruined plans and regret and wasted time and impotent rage do not lead to some final edge from which there is no return, but that the edge can be skirted, on the faintest trails that run perpendicular to purpose, to places unsuspected and new. My head may be free of plans for now and enraptured in just-revealed beauty and meaning, but a fact is gnawing. ItÂs in that shred of superego that wears polycarbonate riot gear and wields the baton of anxiety and demands that I behave, that even this, right now, this breathtaking place with me in it worrying the last granules of cattle-manure from my teeth, is a job interview, a place where I need to maintain my guard, to behave, to do what I should. This personal cop reminds me, and reminds me again and again, that I am wrong and I feel shame and loathing and self-loathing and real terror that I will be found, even here. And also the worry that I am now seriously tripping and alone and the light is fading. The westfacing red wall across the valley will get redder and redder for a few more hours, but already IÂm in shade, and here in the mountains the temperature falls quick and bracing the moment the sun sets. I will spend the night alone and tripping in the cold and I will have terrible clear visions of the wreck of my life.
1038	0	a	Now I walk downhill, and remember that a new athletic ability comes with mushrooms. I jump like a goat from black basalt ball to ball over the top of the grass and fireweed, very quickly, but sure. My pack is a massive muscle on my back. I am a goat and a bison. The land drops away like a Hitchcock stairwell and I smell water icy and green. The blond heart-shapes of elk rumps bob into the woods below me and I drop through layers of scent: gunpowder rock, lime lichen, birdshit, bearfunk, elkpellets, troutstream, and this last brings me up short and a whip of the oldest primate caution bends my spine and tightens my thighs and I slide into the trees along the stream aware that there is an animal and aware that it is unaware of me in my silence. So I drift like breeze-blown catkin fluff into a thicket of serviceberry and the buck is below me bent to the water like a streambank, drinking, crowned with arrows like St. Sebastian, connected at the mouth to his inverted self seen by me against a horn of jumping lights on the still beside the riffle. 
1039	0	a	I am close, but I have slipped here unperceived. Insinuated myself into this. And my mind and the mushrooms conspire to send me a message, for my notebook, for my gun: Man was not ÂI was not-- born for impotent rage, to be emasculated by a dull Mormon wife and the courts that see men as perpetrators and deadbeats. I am here goat-eyed watching this as-yet-not-martyred buck slope to the water like a streambank, exactly like a buck drinking while the world and its inverse pivot around his velvet nose and his crown rhymes with the trees. I am here to think clearly about what I can barely engage, and to make a big decision.
1040	0	a	As bucks do, this one raises his head often to spy lions, but I stand in the bushes and smell him but he doesnÂt notice. Next he slopes to drink again and I raise my hands like ears above my head and when he looks up he sees me against the sky looming there and exits vertically from the streambed as though through some sipapu into a fifth world. The earth drums and he is gone and so is the reflected red light from the facing cliffside. Across the stream is a flat area under the big pines. I manage halfassedly to get a fire going and am totally involved in the flames which seem right then important as heat that can sterilize and cauterize because I have carried here a secret illness from the city IÂve escaped and it hangs here in the dark green expecting an exorcism. 
1041	0	a	And so I spend the night till the east blues sweating disease which feeds the fire and when I wake much later it is afternoon and I am predictably sick, but now I know that beyond enraged submission to my ex-wife and the court, and beyond writing a long note to my girls and stepping off some final edge, is a third way, perpendicular to any purpose I had when I was young and looking ahead, that runs along the cliffside and takes me alone into the deepest canyons and wilderness where everything is always new and unsuspected.

1043	0	a	Mushrooms (39) : Nature / Outdoors (23), General (1), Alone (16)
1044	0	a	One Saturday a bunch of friends and I decided to take mushrooms.  One of our friends invited all of us over and we began to eat the mushrooms.  Some of us had never experienced mushrooms before, so the amounts eaten by each person varied, ranging from 2-5.5 grams.  The time was about around noon and the experience to follow was amazing. 
1045	0	a	These drugs are mind altering substances and the experience is recalled as well as possible.
1046	0	a	I find myself having a slightly higher tolerance to psilocybin then most, or rather because I've done them numerous times and the effects feel more familar now as a result,so the first coming up effects aren't normally felt until about 1-2 hours, for myself depending on dosage. My friends began to feel the effects rise before I did, about 30-45 minutes as I expected.  At around an hour I got extreme nausea, which I've experienced in the past, but because of the dosage the nausea was much stronger. I would say that, for me, the coming up time prior to the peak becomes more uncomfortable as the dose rises.  Everyone sat around listening to music as we felt such strange feelings. A few of us had smoked some weed, and the mushrooms effects were intensified.  I began to feel as if everything around me was somewhat leaning toward me, kinda like the walls seemingly closing in on oneself.  The effects seemed to rise fairly quick and I would notice more and more visualizations.  Waving like patterns flowing around most objects.  Wall paper patterns seeming to creep around on the wall moving from spot to spot.  
1047	0	a	At about 2 hours I felt peak effects start.  A type of anxious anxiety was present as feelings of returning home again, back to this special isolated world somewhere not yet discovered by most people.  Everything appeared to be staring back at me.  I went outside to smoke again and the clouds seemed to form faces in the wind.  The trees seemed to be trying to grab me with their branches. They appeared to be somewhat more life like as the branches appeared as arms, the leaves as hair, and a face forming on the trunk. These visions were amazing. The mushrooms seem to bring out the living spirit from everything around.   Sounds become apparent during this time also as very subtle voices were present, but there source unknown. The sounds aren't really able to be described in words, some sort of vibration going through your head. After smoking, we all listened to the beatles. As I sat on the couch, I felt like I was sinking into the cushions.  Kinda like the couch was flowing around my body.  Music was a very important factor for this experience with mushrooms. Songs involving keyboards or mood synthesizers, or even good light guitar playing were perfect choices.  Made the mood more pleasant.
1048	0	a	Ever since my first encounter with mushrooms, plants and trees now have some unseen beauty that I have never realized before.  Staring at flowers, they seem to be somewhat alive and able to move around. The colors of everything magnified 10 fold. Everyone else seemed to be coming down after about 4 hours. They decided to go get pizza, since no one had eaten prior to the trip. My body felt hungry but the mushrooms wouldn't allow me to eat.  When we arrived at the restaurant it was difficult reading the menu as the letters looked as if they were jumping around on the page, so I ordered a regular being as that it was the simplest at the time.  Upon receiving my slice the cheese looked as if it was looking back at me.  I picked apart at it being because of stomach cramps.  The end of the day was nearing and the view of the sunset was a vivid detail of this trip.  The rays of the sun and the pink and orange shades made the sky look like I had never seen it before.
1049	0	a	I had gone home, the time now around 6pm. Upon arrival I went to the bathroom.  I ended up staring at myself in the mirror because the reflection looked different the normal and it felt odd looking at what is always expected to seem the same was suddenly very unfamiliar. I lie in bed and stare at ceiling till returning to baseline. I went to sleep and woke up the next morning 'homesick', but wasn't compelled to eat them again.

1051	0	a	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
1052	0	a	I obtained 5 dried grams of mushrooms from a guy I'd got some off previously. I decided to ingest 5 grams on this occasion because I did 3 grams last time, I had a very good experience, but thought it would be interesting to increase the dose and push the boat out a little. When I acquired the shrooms, I didn't ask what kind of they were, I assumed they were the same as the ones I got before (Psilocybe cubensis).
1053	0	a	After ingesting the mushrooms, as the intensity of experience slowly increased, I noticed something strange and distinct compared to my previous mushroom journeys...patterns, geometrical shapes of a kind I had never seen before. I recognized them as being Aztec-like. I saw Aztec gods, giving me knowledge, telling me secrets, leading me through some kind of ancient places, they told me how this life is a test, which we must pass. I saw their buildings, it was very realistic, everything. I saw one temple, and on the top of it, there was some bright golden light with was radiating the most beautiful light ever, radiating light and love. I encountered some kind of jaguar people, which were very friendly and loving. I relived the experiences and memories of Aztec people. On one occasion, when my sitter asked me if I was alright, I looked at him, and clearly saw him dressed as an Aztec priest. Interestingly, afterwards I read an account of the late, great Dr Albert Hofmann who ingested 3.2g of dried lab grown P. mexicana mushrooms to bioassay them for psychoactivity, and he reported exactly the same thing! 'When the doctor supervising the experiment bent over to check my blood pressure, he was transformed into an Aztec priest, and I would not have been astonished had he drawn an obsidian knife.'
1054	0	a	When the experience ended, I was in complete awe and disbelief. Shortly after I almost completely came down, I phoned that guy to ask him what kind of shrooms these were, because I had never had an experience like that. When he told me those were Psilocybe mexicana, I just hang up, without saying a word. I was in greatest shock and amazement since my very birth.
1055	0	a	I broke down in tears afterwards due to the power and profundity of what I had experienced; words can't even touch what I experienced.
1	2	a	Once we were Âthere,Â and we stayed ÂthereÂ from 12:00 to 6:30 AM, it felt like time had completely halted. It didnÂt fast forward or rewind uncontrollably, it just... Stopped. We wondered if the sun was ever going to come back up. When it finally did after what felt like days, we stopped tripping almost immediately. The come down was so smooth that by 8:00 AM we happily drove to McDonalds with no signs of intoxication other than a beautiful afterglow. 
2	2	a	It was unbelievable. My body and mind are usually exhausted at the end of an intense trip, but for once I felt as though the acid had given me life and energy. ItÂs been a few days since the trip and I still feel incredible! ItÂs been very easy for me to integrate the experience into my life, which is surprising given how profound it was. It intrigued to me to think how impactful a positive psychedelic experience like mine could be on so many of the people I know that havenÂt tried these drugs yet, but I can see why theyÂre so timid about it. For me, tripping feels like the most ÂadultÂ thing one can possibly do. ItÂs heavy metal, itÂs alien, and if one does it right, itÂs the ultimate ecstasy.

4	2	a	LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Hangover / Days After (46), General (1)
5	2	a	For about a year now I've been experimenting heavily with mixing LSD and different types of meditation such as kundalini meditation and astral projection.
6	2	a	A friend got me a really good batch of liquid LSD and at around the same time I'd been using an audio entrainment called 'Meditation Mastery Activations' for Higher Self communication.
7	2	a	I was staying in a friend's cabin in the Californian redwoods and she was away at the time - perfect.  The acid was really smooth, I was sitting out in the sun looking at the trees and could see them breathing.  The trunks were pulsating in and out.  I could also clearly see the trunks radiating a bright green aura.  
8	2	a	Clearly things were kicking in nicely so I put on my headphones and started the Higher Self meditation.
9	2	a	Seconds, minutes, hours later?  I don't know.  I behind closed eyes I could just see white light getting stronger and stronger.  I began to hear a beautiful hum and I started getting visions as if I was traveling at light speed.
10	2	a	All of a sudden I felt myself burst into some kind of dimension.  Where all this light was coming from.  I was floating, flowing, soaking in it.  I could see inside my body and I saw it being filled with these streams of light.  Things would slow, then speed up amazingly fast and I couldn't keep up, but at all times it was ecstatic.
11	2	a	I had the strongest feeling that I was floating inside my Higher Self somehow.  I just knew.  I didn't need anything here and I didn't want for anything.  I must have been here for a few hours, because when I came out the sun had changed a fair bit in the sky.
12	2	a	It's taken me a lot of time to process this experience and there is so much I just can't put into words.    
13	2	a	This was one of the most profound experiences that I've ever had.

16	2	a	'Painting Realizations: 10 Things I Learned From My First Trip'
17	2	a	Before starting this report, IÂd like to explain who the people involved in my life that will be mentioned are. 
18	2	a	IÂll refer to myself as Len. IÂm an international student who has recently moved to New York City to attend college. I donÂt want to disclose too much, but IÂll tell you I used to live in Europe. IÂm currently studying Communications, though for some time I have wanted to switch to Music Business. I am not very happy with my living arrangement within the University - I live with 11 other girls in a loft, which is always dirty, as they donÂt clean up after themselves. I feel disconnected with them, and I am not too comfortable in that environment. 
19	2	a	I have shared this experience with two other girls, who have now become my Acid Sisters. The first is my closest friend here in New York, Summer. Summer and I have been friends for almost a year now, and we have a lot in common spiritually, which I was aware of even before the trip. The other girl is Dianna. SheÂs been friends with Summer, also for a significant amount of time, but before this experience we werenÂt awfully close - nevertheless, I did like Dianna a lot. 
20	2	a	We were sober-sat by Louise (though she prefers sober-played-with), and her sort-of-boyfriend Frey, who I went to high school with. Louise is DiannaÂs suite mate, who shares the apartment in the dorm with her, and she was there as we dropped in DiannaÂs room. We were meant to originally do it in SummerÂs room, but her roommate (who isnÂt too fond of psychedelic substances) was there, and DiannaÂs place was bigger anyways. 
21	2	a	Another thing I should mention is that at one point in this story, DiannaÂs current sort-of- boyfriend, Mark, stops by. I am not too fond of Mark for two reasons. First, the only time I hung out with him, Summer, and Dianna, during the previous week, he seemed somewhat pompous. He would recite textbook-like phrases, and IÂd stand there, high as a kite, watching as Dianna wrote it all down. It almost seemed like the Mark-cult, which I was definitely not eager to join. 
22	2	a	The second reason comes in handy, because it also provides some backstory for some of the things that I saw, and felt, during the trip. Earlier on the month, IÂd began a sexual relationship with this guy called Seth. I, stupidly enough, fell head over heels for him. I think everyone around me realized that he didnÂt care for me... except for me. DonÂt get me wrong, I had reasons to believe that wasnÂt the case, but I was somewhat blinded by other convictions as well. When we tripped, I hadnÂt seen Seth for about two weeks, and we were no longer involved, as he had ÂditchedÂ me accidentally one night, and I had decided IÂd had enough, so I deleted his number and texts from my phone. Summer had run into him, and he kept claiming he was going to reach out to me, but when I contacted him and was ignored, I decided to let it go and give up. It wasnÂt easy, and I kept blaming myself for it, seeing Seth as a special, wasted opportunity I had thrown away. I was simply unable to move on, or realize better would have come along eventually. Because both Mark and Seth were film students, they shared a lot of classes, which brought about a certain hostility between them. Mark despised Seth, and claimed he was extremely pretentious and aloof (which is true enough, but save the aloofness, also applicable to Mark himself). That very same night we hung out, he declared ferociously ÂFuck Seth!Â to which I amicably replied, ÂHah, been there, done thatÂ. He was visibly irked out, and said to me, ÂWow, IÂm sorry you have to live with yourself, after that.Â I didnÂt feel particularly insulted, but rather undermined and skeptical about this guyÂs supposed Âcaring, gentle, spiritÂ. I just didnÂt see it. 
23	2	a	Now that everyone has been introduced, letÂs begin at the beginning.
24	2	a	This whole venture began about five months ago, when, before meeting in person, Summer and I decided we wanted to explore psychedelic endeavors - she proposed eventually taking shrooms and listening to Lou Reed (who is a somewhat mythical figure to me), which I was all in for.
25	2	a	We felt ready around the beginning of October, back when I met this kid called Dylan West - whom we all just called West. IÂd describe him as a fuckboy junkie extraordinaire; heÂs the kind of guy whoÂs currently trying to grow pot in his dorm room, dabs indoors with the smoke detectors all over the place, trips almost on a bi-weekly basis, and has a penchant for smoking up with steamy showers in the bathrooms indoors. As soon as I decided Seth was a no-go, I had ended up WestÂs world. I slept over at his place for the entire weekend, two weeks before tripping, and we eventually hooked up at one point. I knew he was the right person to ask for a hookup. 
26	2	a	Predictably, New York City drugs are expensive. West recommended one gram for each of us as a threshold dose (both Summer and I are 5Â2Â and about 110 lbs., so it typically doesnÂt take a lot for us to be affected), but his dealerÂs prices would have forced us to spend ti50 on it, which he said wasnÂt worth it. Earlier on the week, a friend of mine, Remy, had taken shrooms, and was only able to trip on 2g. This would have brought the total of our supposed expenses to $100, which I just could not spend on drugs (yet I have probably already spent it on cigarettes, go figure). West then recommended us just going with acid instead. I was reluctant, since I believed shrooms would have been a better initiation, as they were more ÂnaturalÂ, and I wasnÂt too eager to put such harsh chemicals through my body. West claimed it wasnÂt much of a difference, and that he had started with LSD anyways. That wasnÂt enough to convince me, since one of WestÂs go-to catch phrases waking up in the morning was ÂI need to get fucked up before breakfast. Sobriety is overrated.Â I didnÂt wish to end up like that, so I checked in with Summer and she was okay with acid instead of shrooms. I was desperate to begin my career as a psychonaut, so I gave in at my best friendÂs request. 
27	2	a	We met WestÂs dealer three days before tripping, and paid about ti45 for two tabs of, supposedly, Âpure-ass acidÂ that we placed in a fire-engine-red Italian Sicilian Orange Tic Tac box. Turns out, it was a great container, as the red filtered out most light from the substance, and acid is best kept in a cool, dark environment. Summer and I had planned to trip on Saturday night, but we had decided to head to a frat party on Friday, where she didnÂt have a great experience, and needed one day to recover. 
28	2	a	On Sunday morning, I was very upset. My room in the dorm was so messed up from me attempting to re-organize it that my bed was entirely covered in plastic bags, so I decided to sleep on the couch of the common area. My roommate hadnÂt noticed me, and accidentally locked me out of our room, before leaving for her hometown for fall recess break. Because this wasnÂt the first time that this had happened, I flipped out. There was outright screaming on my part in my native language, and I am not ashamed to say I talked to myself as a means to release stress. I had to go downstairs with the previous nightsÂ makeup, my pajamas and no shoes, so I felt extremely embarrassed. To add to that, Summer called to let me know that Dianna was going to join us, and she had decided to split her tab with her. I felt abandoned by her, and unwilling to accept it, (I now understand that this is definitely none of my business to control and decide). 
29	2	a	I definitely think that that freakout was one of the best things that could have happened. Back when Summer confessed to me that she didnÂt want to trip on Saturday, she was particularly shaken, which brought me to have negative feelings regarding the Seth situation. Releasing all of my stress and anger put me in one of the best mental places for the trip, and I felt powerful and reinvigorated. I ran some errands throughout the day, and met Summer around 7 PM. We went to our respective homes, so that she could pick up the Tic Tac box, and change into more comfortable clothes. On our way back to DiannaÂs, we saw Frey and Louise, and they told us they were going to swing by later, which I was happy and excited about. 
30	2	a	We briefly saw Mark outside of the building of DiannaÂs dorm (Summer and I lived in the same complex - which I will refer to as Blue C - while Dianna lived in Square Hall), as he exited, and told him about our subsequent plans. He wished us well, and we walked in the building. 
31	2	a	As soon as we saw our trip location, I was positively satisfied. It was a dorm apartment, so it wasnÂt enormous, but definitely bigger than SummerÂs. There was a small hall and a living room area with a round circular table and a couch, as well as a decent bathroom and average-size kitchen. Dianna also said we were welcome to go to her room whenever, since her roommate wasnÂt home, but we remained in the common area for the initial part of the night. One of the reasons why we had also decided to do it at DiannaÂs was because she had prepared endless tubes of acrylic pigments and large poster-size paper for us to paint on. 
32	2	a	I read a list of precautions and possible acid-induced negative thoughts that we might have had, so we could prepare for the worst in case of bad trips. We all turned out to have had designated tasks: I was the well-read expert, Summer had to physically take care of the stuff, and Dianna was more concerned with preparing activities to keep ourselves occupied during the night. 
33	2	a	Summer placed four different pieces of blotter paper on the table. One of them was a small 100 microgram square, which was for me, and two were tinier half pieces. There was also a little extra bit that Dianna and Summer also split. All in all, IÂd say they had about 50 micrograms each as their ultimate dose. (One of the reasons I was initially opposed to them splitting the other blotter was because their doses would have been significantly lower than mine, which I thought would have put me on a whole different level of experience, and I didnÂt want to be alone. Luckily, this didnÂt turn out to be an issue for any factor, besides duration of our trips, but IÂll get to that later.) 
34	2	a	We were all pretty unaccustomed to acid consumption, so we placed the blotters underneath our tongue and waited, as IÂd read was the most traditional and effective mean of consumption. This was about 8 PM. 
35	2	a	For a little bit we just chilled out and talked, then Frey and Louise came back with their takeout food. We chatted up with them for some twenty minutes, and I discussed music with Louise. I was very reassured, as she and I were passionate about similar artists and genres, and I immediately thought she was going to be a brilliant DJ for the night. Summer then suggested us grabbing dinner, since we hadnÂt had much food (we both donÂt eat a lot... IÂd been so upset I was mostly hunger-less the whole day, and had only had a couple of slices of bread and a Special K bar, along with my coffee, as breakfast). We briefly stopped by CVS, before the acid started to hit us, and I picked up some sushi, while she opted for veggie dumplings. 
36	2	a	We went back to Square Hall, at DiannaÂs, to eat, and immediately after I was done, I felt my muscles tensing up. I had a specific tense spot between my shoulder blades, which had me lifting and narrowing them. I immediately announced to Summer I was Âtensing upÂ, and she nodded saying she also started to feel physically different (she mentioned something about not being able to feel her left arm and leg tension). I donÂt remember Dianna being particularly affected by that point, but she decided to sit on the floor, and began painting. 
37	2	a	Summer mentioned the blotter not dissolving yet after about 30 minutes of having taken it (she ate afterwords) and Louise recommended switching location to the rooftop of the mouth - this is possibly something to keep in mind for the next trip, as it immediately dissolved afterwards. I had accidentally swallowed my blotter earlier, which was probably one the reasons, along with the larger dose, why my trip was somewhat ÂdelayedÂ when compared to theirs. Dianna was a true trooper, who kept the blotter underneath her tongue until it dissolved - and it took a long time: about an hour, but she began coming up immediately after it was absorbed. 
38	2	a	I had previously recommended us performing an activity while waiting to come up, as IÂd read it was much better to casually notice we were tripping, rather than waiting for tell-tale signs. I joined Dianna on the floor, and began to stroke swirls in an abstract manner (regardless of my background as an art student, IÂm not much of a painter.) 
39	2	a	About an hour after we dropped, I began to feel different. The muscle tension increased, and as I was prompted to look at my hand, I realized it felt disconnected from my body. It wasnÂt like a phantom limb, where I didnÂt feel it - it just felt foreign and far. As soon as I looked up at my surroundings, I realized everything felt slightly foreign and far. The circumstances were weird, and I asked myself what was so peculiar about the reality I was in. ÂThis feels weird,Â I said. Louise looked up at me with a concerned look, and asked, ÂBad weird?Â. I considered, and had a hard time deciding: my feelings, thoughts, and emotions, were getting hazier and confused, ÂNot really... not bad and not good, just weirdÂ. This sense of weirdness persisted throughout the whole trip and well-into the next day. I considered, and had a hard time deciding: my feelings, thoughts, and emotions, were getting hazier and confused, ÂNot really... not bad and not good, just weirdÂ. This sense of weirdness persisted throughout the whole trip and well-into the next day. I later realized it was this weirdness that caused me to dissociate from my immediate reality, and re-evaluate the world around me. 
40	2	a	My painting style was then forced to become different, as my movements became more erratic as a result of the growing muscular tension, and I decided to instinctively pick up colors, and just Âthrow them aroundÂ on the paper. Instead of swirls, I began to shade, mix, and create shapes of various sizes and forms. I disrupted the harmonious green-teal-gold scheme I was working with, to add traces of red, peach, yellow, and navy. I felt euphoric and inspired, as if IÂd just had two pops of Adderall or Ritalin (I sometimes take ADD prescription meds - despite not having ADD - as a way to concentrate on studying, and stay up all night). Dianna began talking, and I found everything she had to say extremely funny. Her, Summer, and I were laughing loudly at the most random comments made by each other, Louise, or Frey. 
41	2	a	LouiseÂs roommate, whose name I forget, was at the apartment too, and prepared brownies. I wasnÂt particularly hungry after the sushi, but decided to try one, as they looked very good. Unfortunately, I think she baked them with the wrong ingredients, since they tasted like garlic. The smell was so strong, I didnÂt even want to be next to the batch. Neither Louise, Frey, or herself seemed to notice any of this, or chose not to say anything, like Dianna. Summer and I both agreed they were really bad. 
42	2	a	The sense of weirdness slowly pervaded everything around me, and it evolved into an inability of my brain to properly process, and make sense of, my surroundings. It wasnÂt like I didnÂt understand anything anymore, but more like my immediate reality just didnÂt compute. Why was I there out of all places? Why was Frey, whom I went to school with, there? Why were he and Louise involved now? That was all so random. I couldnÂt justify any of it, and was very bothered by the fact. 
43	2	a	Acid attention-span is notoriously limited, so I shook my worrisome thoughts away, in favor of a deep desire to leave the room. Dianna and Summer followed me, as we headed to the floorÂs hallway to look at the traffic and cars through the window. That was the only part of the trip where I felt extremely energetic, and I had a deep desire to release this energy by running around. Dianna, Summer and I ran around the stairs, laughingly numbed down. All across the stairway, there were signs up, which depicted an apple and a cigarette with a red cross over it. Summer remarked that it was the most messed up Âno-smokingÂ sign sheÂd ever seen, and I explained that the apple represented New York City, the Big Apple, so it did make sense. I realized that if I concentrated, and really looked at something, I could make sense of it, so I got very excited. We were about to run further down, when Louise came back to get us, and lead us back into the apartment. 
44	2	a	When Dianna, Summer, Louise, and I went back to the apartment, the weirdness continued. Sitting back down was difficult; I felt so hyperactive, but I let my movements guide me on the canvas, continuing my shading. Immediately, when I looked over at her, I noticed Dianna wasnÂt as keen on keeping herself as grounded, and she began to giggle all over the place again. I canÂt really remember how much time had passed while we were like that, but before I knew it, I noticed Dianna asking Louise to paint her feet.
45	2	a	Louise picked up a clean, fine brush, dipped in purple paint, and began drawing steady swirls all over DiannaÂs feet, who felt giddy and excited. She laughed and waved her long arms in the air, as she announced how liberating it felt. Suddenly, Dianna was so into the whole painting experience, I noticed her taking off her t-shirt, revealing a sports bra. I asked her whether she felt cold, but she was way too exhilarated to answer, or care, probably. She began painting her own tummy in a dark teal color, and at every stroke, she felt more enthusiastic and free. It was beautiful for me to watch that, and I felt like I was seeing all of Dianna expressing her artistic nature - (Dianna is currently studying screenwriting, but in her spare time she sings, acts, and plays the trumpet. She defines herself as a full-fledged artist.) 
46	2	a	ÂThis is what I was meant to do!Â she continued to exclaim, Âthis is just what I needed! IÂm releasing all of my artistic energy, and this is wonderful. It feels so right!Â. Upon seeing her so relieved, about something as, supposedly, trivial, as splashing paint on her bare tummy, I felt envious of Dianna for a split second. She was like a little kid, rediscovering the joy of colors all over again, and I wished I could feel like that about paint too. I wanted to find something to also feel liberated and lightheaded. All of a sudden, Summer, who had been sitting in a corner, blasting out some dank tunes, got up and demanded Dianna to paint her calves. Dianna picked up the navy brush IÂd been using, and began drawing patterns on SummerÂs calve. 
47	2	a	Now, I really donÂt remember how what happened next initially developed, but I suppose it spawned out of a conversation I wasnÂt paying attention to. I was extremely concentrated in identifying how I felt, and settling down the weirdness. I think I spent a significant amount of time staring at Frey and Louise, who were also playing a drawing game (they were attempting to construct a character, by each drawing a head, torso, and legs in turn, and then comparing the result). I was really trying to spot the Âlittle thingsÂ that made me think of them as a couple: sneaky kisses, graceful grazes, and just overall looks. I found it fascinating. 
48	2	a	But back to what I missed, as soon as I turned around, I noticed Dianna had written ÂFuck MisogynyÂ on SummerÂs tiny calve. I laughed very loudly, which prompted them to laugh more with me. Dianna then realized she Âwanted more paint!Â, and went to change into shorts. I started to feel a sense of extreme euphoria: I wanted to laugh, I wanted to paint, and I wanted to feel everyone around me on a deeper level. It was a strange sensation - something I thought as more akin to MDMA (which I havenÂt tried, but am intending to soon).
49	2	a	Dianna raced back in a pair of short shorts, and I still wondered how she wasnÂt freezing, since we were all wearing hoodies but her. She looked down at me, and asked, with a huge grin on her face, ÂLen, write ÂFuck MisogynyÂ on my thighs! In red! I want it to look ginormous and aggressive!Â. I found the request hilarious, and agreed immediately. My muscles were still tense, and I felt strangely antsy (similar to the Ritalin-antsy I feel when I cruise), so the result wasnÂt the best. Not to mention, I accidentally misspelled ÂMisogynyÂ and had attempted to correct it, making the letters even more daunting and bolder-looking. Dianna was, nonetheless, very pleased with the result, as it wrapped around her back, and she had the last syllable visible only from behind. It was at that point that she said, ÂYou need some color in you!Â and sprinkled my hair and forehead in lavender. 
50	2	a	Something you must know about me, I am extremely paranoid about my hair. I need to constantly straighten it every time I wash it (itÂs naturally frizzy/wavy), and IÂd just done that for the occasion, earlier on the day. Having paint in my hair would have made it crusty and dirty, so as soon as I saw it there, I exclaimed, ÂDianna! Not my hair!Â, still laughing, of course. She conceded, but didnÂt let go of my face, ÂOkay, but you still need some more colorÂ. At that point, Summer came up from behind, and began painting the back of DiannaÂs legs, who then sneaked up on me, and stroked a huge red line on my face. I hadnÂt even realized it, but a painting battle was ensuing. Dianna was so into it, she began painting both herself and us, by squeezing the tubes directly on our skin. She recommended Summer and I both change in shorts and sports bras, so we could all paint each other. 
51	2	a	I am not the kind of person who typically agrees to this kind of stuff. I am not entirely comfortable with getting down and dirty, but I thought to myself, ÂIÂm on acid, might as well!Â and as soon as I had mentally accepted the fact I was going to get painted all over, I felt extremely ecstatic. I wouldnÂt say my emotional responses were slowed down or delayed, but rather amplified: I processed everything with intensity, and was determined to survey my stance on every event that took place. Obviously, because of the confusion and haze of weirdness, I didnÂt reach very promising conclusions. It was very basic business - either something made me very happy, or very confused. 
52	2	a	When I went to DiannaÂs room to change, I realized I didnÂt even care about being nude with the door open. I have always been very confident and at ease with being naked, but it was always with people I knew. In this case, in order to put DiannaÂs clothes on, I needed to go full topless for some seconds, and Frey was right there in the living room, which was directly adjacent. I found myself so contented in my own skin that I wouldnÂt have minded being full-on naked and dancing. Still, I did realize that it wasnÂt an option, because of our hosts. 
53	2	a	This is something worth mentioning: when I was on acid, I was perfectly able to put myself in the shoes of a sober person. I could immediately imagine how Louise and Frey, and even LouiseÂs roommate, must have felt seeing that weird spectacle, and I initially apologized for it. Thankfully, Louise happens to be incredibly awesome, so she simply smiled at me and said, ÂLen, youÂre on LSD, itÂs bound to get weird. Stop apologizing.Â 
54	2	a	Our acid-uniform was extremely revealing, but it was absolutely perfect for the incredible amounts of paint we were about to pour on each other. I was wearing brown lipstick, and immediately realized it couldnÂt stay on. I needed to be fully naked, fully raw, so I quickly went to the bathroom to remove it. It was laborious, but entertaining; I tried to use tissues and water, but it smeared a red stain all over my chin - which only made me laugh more. Most people say mirrors arenÂt a good idea on acid, but I have to disagree. I loved looking at myself so happy and carefree. 
55	2	a	Eventually, I realized that Dianna actually had makeup-remover wipes, and attempted to use them to remove the red smear on my face. I was somewhat successful, but at one point I remembered I was about to get paint all over it anyways, so I just left and ran back out. The sight I was greeted with was peculiar, to say the least: both Summer and Dianna were dipping their hands in paint, and plastering each other with it. I immediately joined, with black and gold 
56	2	a	palms, but as more paint accidentally got in my long, blonde hair, I felt even more uneasy. Louise, who was watching from a distance, offered to put my hair up in a top knot, and I thanked her endlessly. I remember thinking that she was being like a little guardian angel for us. 
57	2	a	And, like that, we drifted into another dimension. We painted our cheeks, our bellies, our chests, our legs, our arms... and it was beautiful. I wouldnÂt say that for me and Summer it was as liberating as it must have been for Dianna, who is much more connected to painting than us. Yet, it was something filled with beauty. We were in a daze of colors and easygoing uneasiness - it was weird, but it was okay! ThatÂs when the perception of time went out of the window. I frankly donÂt remember for how long we painted each other for, but it was like a sacred ritual, so it was worthy of being timeless. 
58	2	a	At that point, an RA knocked on our door. It was Sunday night, and starting 11 PM, all halls of our university force us to turn music and voices down for Âquiet hoursÂ. I hadnÂt factored time in, so I immediately jumped to the conclusion that this person clearly knew we were on LSD, so I ran to DiannaÂs room. She saw me and smiled anxiously, ÂLen, you canÂt hide! This doesnÂt even look suspicious... they canÂt know! What would they write us up for? Being fucking weirdos covered in paint? IsnÂt that what college is all about?Â. For someone on acid, that was series of very logical arguments. 
59	2	a	Sadly, I couldnÂt be as logical as Dianna, so I still felt worried. Louise answered the door, and, like we suspected, the RA only wanted us to turn the volume down a bit, to which she agreed, and he, supposedly, left. I donÂt think he paid attention to, or saw, the three of us. I stumbled upon the mirror as I walked back to the living room, for what I thought was going to be round two of paint, and everything changed. 
60	2	a	As soon as I saw myself, I was shell-shocked. My face striped in red and gold, my legs scribbled in teal and navy, and my tummy yellow and purple - I felt so feral, so animalistic, so wild. I felt like a ferocious version of me. Summer and Dianna turned around to tell me how beautiful I looked, which only fueled this sensation more. SummerÂs face was half-black and half-teal, and she also seemed real and majestic... and Dianna? DiannaÂs face was green! She looked like mother nature! I felt connected to the two of them on a deeper level, like we were a tribe of painted Indians (IÂm pretty sure that if IÂd taken two tabs - like we plan to do soon - and felt a more intense high, I would have started to do some powwow dance shit. Summer had been dancing all night already, as she has had dancing training background, and was so in-tune with the harmonies that played, I loved watching her). 
61	2	a	We had never looked so beautiful, to me, but the more I scrutinized my appearance, the more I came to the realization that the paint had to come off. I looked at DiannaÂs tummy, the first body part we had painted, and noticed the previously moist pigment had now solidified, and seemed fibrous and hardened, like it was about to crack at any minute. The paint was now a fraud - a courageous cover hiding my true self, and I had to let go of it immediately. My soul had to be completely naked for the trip, and this paint was covering it! Sure it had been fun, but like all things it had to end. 
62	2	a	As I began to scrape the hardened paint off of my chest, I realized what I just thought. I realized how immersed into my own thought process I was, and I slowed down. I rubbed my skin slowly and, frankly, it became even a little painful after a while (when I looked at the mirror, the peeled parts were all visibly sensitive-looking and reddened). It didnÂt matter though, because I was letting go of what covered me to reveal my true self and begin my trip - and there was no better come up. Feeling my flesh through my flesh was almost like a paradoxical surreal experience: my sense of touch was confused as to which surface was actually part of my own body, and which simply encrusted it. I gave myself warmth and protection; I suddenly felt very warm and cozy inside. 
63	2	a	The more I embraced myself by rubbing it all away, the more these thoughts seemed to have appeared. I thought about feeling at one with me - about wanting to keep hugging and touching myself; about nourishment. In particular, the nourishment of my soul, and how much feeding it must have been doing through my endless turbine of volatile, airy emotions. 
64	2	a	At this point, IÂd crossed the event horizon. The thoughts about spirituality, and communion with the self, clouded up my mind at every dazzling fingertip motion I made on my surface skin. This is the moment where I truly realized I was very high. My trip had actually commenced, and there was no going back now! 
65	2	a	On an important note: I wasnÂt impeded. I feel like movies, television, songs, or even just peopleÂs verbal or visual descriptions and portrayals of being high on LSD are very much different from what you end up feeling, at least from what I ended up feeling on my dose. I wasnÂt Âtotally fucked up!Â, like I could have never stepped out of it. In fact, IÂm sure that if I had been given some sort of fairly easy task, I would have been able to complete it (obviously nothing that required lots of creativity, as letting the mind run wild is what ultimately tripping is all about, and would definitely stimulate it.) Basically, I could have kept my cool, no problem there. 
66	2	a	The problems seemed to arise when I let myself zone out: my intellect drifting in and out of reality, and its metaphysical formations. Whenever I retreated into my own little world, I saw what was around me as a fraud - as a metaphysical landscape which, despite striving fearlessly, was definitely not the actual truth that I was exposed to on a daily basis. I was stuck in this dream-like haze, absorbing everything else around me, and soaking it in my melted brainÂs acid- juice. Still, IÂd like to stress how much mentally hampered I wasnÂt. I was on drugs, sure, but when drunk, or stoned, IÂm usually less likely to be at a complete cognitive loss. I mean, nothing goes on, as far as brain functions go, when IÂm on those substances. Acid was much more like there was too much going on. 
67	2	a	Speaking of, everything was too much. This particular state caused me a lot of what is commonly known as ÂdistressÂ. IÂm saying Âcommonly knownÂ because the word closest to describing how reality affected me at that point was ÂdistressÂ - yet it holds a really negative connotation. I want to highlight the fact that the distress I was feeling wasnÂt entirely negative, oh no. This goes for anything else that might follow in the report: even if it seems like IÂm describing negative emotions, they most definitely werenÂt. Most of my trip was tainted by euphoria, wonder, and confusion - but overall, it was a very neutral experience, which made it much more complex, and interesting. 
68	2	a	So, back to the distress. I believe it was caused by the fact that everything around me was too much to handle. I looked over at every single random object around, and it amazed me. It wasnÂt like it seemed new, or I was seeing it through new eyes - no; I knew exactly what everything was, but I couldnÂt register it. I couldnÂt compute or understand it. Everything seemed to have a point, and objects just didnÂt. They just lied there, and the fact that they did was baffling me. It was funny, and, as always, confusing, at the same time. Everything sparked a whole new trail of thoughts and observations, so when I was forced to just look at things, I couldnÂt. I had to sit back, and actually observe them, considering them in the most holistic way possible. 
69	2	a	This, in turn, prompted me to think of acid as a little lens that zoomed into my feelings regarding everything. The intensity of emotions I felt was incredibly amplified, and I mean, I donÂt consider myself as particularly apathetic on a daily basis, but IÂm not very in tune with what I feel either. As I kept peeling scrapes of paint off of my belly, I was trying to identify how I felt - but I felt so much. At the same time. And I couldnÂt break it apart, no matter how much I tried, all I could do was just sit there and feel it, soaking it all in, like a little sponge. 
70	2	a	Dianna and Summer, who were definitely more socially engaged with each other by that point, just kept peeling, until one of them (I honestly cannot remember who it was) suggested to hop in the shower. Dianna thought it was a magnificent idea and, with a cheshire-cat worthy grin, sprinted to the bathroom to get the water running. Summer followed her with excitement, but I wasnÂt as joyful, all of a sudden. The feeling of weirdness from before had settled in with extreme intensity, and my inability to process my immediate surroundings sent me mentally far back to civilization. I thought about the concept of a shower - and how that involves getting hair wet. 
71	2	a	My hair was still in that top knot Louise had solidly pinned up in place an hour before, (I actually have no idea how much time had passed. Dianna had devised a system where she would give Mark a call every hour, in order to keep track of time, but had given it up after the first two calls, as we had decided to succumb to acid and lose ourselves in its timeless dimension), but it wasnÂt going to save much from the furious dorm-room nozzle sprinkling DiannaÂs bathtub was equipped with. In the real world we could have found a way for me not to get my hair wet, but thinking systematically about real-life practical solutions seemed like a removed concept. No, I knew that if I stepped in that tub, my glorious straightened locks would have turned into the unruly lionÂs mane I was born with. 
72	2	a	It probably seems a little weird to you that IÂm making such a big deal out of... well, hair. But it defined me. It still does. My hair is one of my favorite things about me, and I love to have control over how it looks, styling it to my liking. Getting it wet made me fearful and anxious, but I felt even more fearful and anxious, as soon as I realized my friends had left me in the living room. IÂm sure Louise and Frey were caught up in their own little romantic game to mind my uneasiness, but I still decided to join Summer and Dianna in the bathroom, instead. 
73	2	a	I saw them immediately hop in the tub, and turn, the shower on. Dianna took off her bra, and did her arm-wave thing again, her eyes squint-shut and her mouth wide open, soaking in the warm liquid droplets all around. Summer kept her top on for a little while, as she tried to only wash the paint off of her feet, but Dianna pushed her right below the water. She looked peaceful and exhilarated, letting out a loud, genuine laugh. It was so nice to see the two of them so happy. It warmed me up inside, when the rest of what was around me seemed cold and meaningless. 
74	2	a	They were somewhere else, but I wasnÂt with them. I was caught up in figuring out a way to get the paint off of my body without getting my hair wet. I sat by the tub, in front of the sink, with knees up to my nose. I found that I still couldnÂt help but touch myself, I needed to feel my body there, with my mind. I was afraid that if I didnÂt, everything would have disconnected. I stared at my legs a lot, but I wasnÂt exactly ÂtrippingÂ; I mean, by that point I still hadnÂt felt extremely visually engaged by the trip. It seemed a little like weed, the colors looked nicer and brighter, but I hadnÂt seen. 
75	2	a	I wasnÂt thinking about that at the present moment, I wasnÂt thinking about anything in particular. Dianna and Summer pulled the shower curtains over, so that the water wouldnÂt have gotten me wet, and that prompted me to shut the door of the bathroom. I stretched my legs and decided to look at what was ahead of me, for a second. Oh man, was it complex. The little tiles squared off every single centimeter of that wall, compressing the whole white thing in small little grids. And the more I heard Dianna and Summer laughing, the more the tiles seemed to reflect that - they were the manifestation of those timid little shrills and squeaks that occasionally escaped from their vocal chords. And thatÂs when I saw. 
76	2	a	I looked down at the mirror, and then at the sink. I was particularly fascinated by the the lower part, as IÂd never previously even paid a single mind to it. I wasnÂt looking at the pipes either, it was just the lower part of the sink container, as I saw it from ground level, that astounded me. I noticed it was white porcelain, and that it had tiny holes at the side. I kept staring at them in amazement, those holes were beautiful: small, delicate, circular, and harmonious with the rest of the design. The beauty ended quite rapidly though, as the smallest of the holes began to slowly expand, and then diminish in size again. Yeah, the sink was definitely breathing. 
77	2	a	I edged closer to stare at that spectacle, and watched carefully, as the hole, which, by that point, had definitely become the sinkÂs mouth, opened and closed ever-so-steadily. But it wasnÂt a calm inhale and exhale... it was gradual, but by no means relaxed. It was frantic, lonely, and bleak. I heard Summer calling my name, wondering why I hadnÂt jumped in, but Dianna quickly explained to her that I was Âgone into my worldÂ. Then again, I totally understood everything, I did hear them - I just chose not to care; the sink seemed like a such a bigger deal at the moment.
78	2	a	And thatÂs when I had my first realization, as I stroked the cold porcelain, I felt out of breath myself. ItÂs the loH, I thought. That loH is making me suffocate; this sink is just as much me as I am breathless, and it. I kept studying the respiratory patterns of the sink, and noticed it slowing down even more, to the point of stopping. As soon as that happened, I opened up the shower curtains, and with what I assume was a terribly bewildered look on my face, I announced, ÂI need to move out of that loft.Â 
79	2	a	Summer smiled open wide (because of a previous incident, which is definitely a story for some other time, Summer really wasnÂt fond of my loft mates, and had always been favorable to the idea of me looking for somewhere else to live in), and her eyes lit up even more, ÂCome on in!Â she encouraged me, nodding off to the tub. 
80	2	a	After having suddenly realized that it was the loft that had made me feel toxic all along (not talking about the trip here, just my state of mind during the day), I felt the sudden need to be clean. To wash it all away, and screw my hair! Yet, I wasnÂt fully convinced.
81	2	a	ÂBut, my hair!Â I complained, ÂIt looks disgusting in its natural waves.Â 
82	2	a	Dianna grinned, ÂI have a straightener,Â she said, ÂItÂll be fun. Come get clean, Len!Â And like that, as she spritzed water onto Summer, who sat there and took it all in with her eyes closed, I realized I had to do that: I had to get clean. I took my top off, stepped into the tub and felt the water on my skin, so warm and comforting. As I rapidly undid LouiseÂs top-knot, I felt even more liberated, ÂGirls, this is my cleanse,Â I announced boldly. 
83	2	a	Once I sat there, there were few more moments where I embraced and rubbed my flesh. I donÂt know whether it was because I felt vaguely cold, or because I wanted to get all traces of paint out, or just because I wanted to keep experiencing the touch of my own skin, but it was effective for all three of those reasons. I cannot tell how much time I spent in my own little tub cocoon: it could have been seconds, minutes, hours, or even days. I remember, at one point, commenting on how it even felt like weeks. 
84	2	a	Sitting there wasnÂt as euphorically entrancing as it looked, by the way. As soon as I settled, I just thought... again. I loved to fall into pensiveness, but the more I came up, the more thoughts I had. I couldnÂt really concentrate on one single thing; everything induced me to question it. I was so removed from the reality around me that everything was overwhelming, and arising simultaneously. But instead of staying separate and going nowhere, it was like all of those questions united into one big reflection - and, after reaching such a promising conclusion on my living situation, I began evaluating other aspects of my life. All of it, all at once. 
85	2	a	As my mind grew heavy, I noticed that Dianna was right, and I was in my own little world. I couldnÂt be social at that moment; I mean, itÂs not exactly like I couldnÂt, more like I really, really, didnÂt want to. Not through words at least. 
86	2	a	I evacuated my mind to look at my fellow trip members, and they seemed to be just as engaged as me. Dianna sat at the end of the tub, lying with her arms spread out on its edge, while Summer had her legs crossed to my right. The more I watched them, the more I felt like I wanted to be in their heads. I wanted to feel what they were feeling, but I couldnÂt bring myself to say it, so I chose actions to portray my words. 
87	2	a	I reached out to them, and embraced their shoulders. They moved closer to me, and we stood there like that for another timeless while. I gripped their wet arms and bodies in shower-soaked glory; feeling their entities in there, in the same position, in the same place - both mentally and physically - was wondrous. We were naked, in every sense of the word. We were all experiencing so much, and the more we touched each other, the more we felt it all around us: our adventures slowly merging together, in one moment of shared acid communion. It was magnificent. 
88	2	a	ThatÂs when we realized that there was no going back, that after this experience, we would have been bonded for life. It wasnÂt just about dropping, and experimenting, with friends anymore. It was about acquiring a new, elevated connection, with each other. I loved them; probably more than I loved my thoughts - and they became my thoughts, as the force of their love and attachment overcame me. I loved love, and I loved to love. So much love. 
89	2	a	Summer, then, decided to head out. I asked her, ÂArenÂt you finding this paradise?Â, to which she just looked at me and remarked, ÂI was like that two hours ago!Â with a big smile on her face. She thought she wasnÂt affected by the substance anymore, but I didnÂt believe her. I let her go, since I figured she probably wanted to be alone for a bit. Dianna and I both agreed that we needed to be warmed up a little more before leaving. 
90	2	a	Dianna leaned her head back on the edge of the tub, and we both retreated back into our own respective dimensions. I was still in a haze of confused emotions, running one after the other, and often together - but all were tinged by love now. I thought about people that had left my life back when I moved here (before leaving, a bit of a mess happened with my old friends in my so-called hometown, and I had been alienated from my social circle) and then, it hit me that I still loved them. But not in a way that was holding me back, in a way whereby I thought of the good times we had had, how much they made me grow, and how thankful I was for all those experiences. I realized life was a constant running course, but that the feelings associated with particular moments would always be there, and I could choose to bring those back, as opposed to the hostility that subsequently overcame our relationships. That didnÂt matter, because it was a negative emotion, and I loved too much to feel it. 
91	2	a	My sea of feelings was briefly softened by Dianna, whom I realized I was lying on top of, only when she put her head up again, and attempted to explain, ÂOh I was on such a good trip Len... I was on a spaceship... but then I became the ship... and I was flying, oh it was beautiful!Â and I could see it. And it was. Picturesque. But I couldnÂt talk about that now, no matter how much I wanted to be visually engaged, I just needed to share emotions. 
92	2	a	ÂI feel so much love right now,Â I communicated casually. My tone seemed almost sleepy and uninterested, but I figured I was simply physically consumed, and mentally overwhelmed, by the experience. ÂDonÂt you?!Â Dianna asked excitedly; she seemed to definitely relate, as her eyes lit up. ÂThereÂs so much love in this apartment now, I couldnÂt be any happier!Â she exclaimed. I simply smiled. Smiling was weird, tense, but so natural. I remember back when we were painting, I couldnÂt help but smile - like I had to tense up my muscles, and do it. But as I grew more pensive, I felt a decided separation from the come-up to the actual trip. The come-up was happiness, the trip was love. I separated them, deciding that, while happiness was beautiful, this was so much more engaging. Experiencing that much love didnÂt make me want to smile. No, it just made me more of a sponge, and I just kept absorbing it all around me. 
93	2	a	ÂAnd the fact that thereÂs so much art in here!Â Dianna added, ÂI just, I just think this is what IÂm meant to be doing, you know? Like all of this art is my calling... all of this art and loveÂ. I would have spoken, but articulating a response took too much effort. (Honestly, I probably did, I just cannot remember what I said... I cannot remember how this particular conversation went, sadly, so IÂm probably paraphrasing what exactly was said. I remember that I just kept going on and on about feelings, while Dianna expanded upon her affinities with art). 
94	2	a	ÂYouÂre such an artist though, like, you actually are!Â valley-girl speak was what was most articulate of me. I thought in very complex terms, but I was only able to express them in condensed form. If I attempted to exposed my theories, as I thought them out, I would have not made any sense whatsoever... but more about that later. 
95	2	a	Dianna smiled, ÂSo are youÂ, she said. And it was true: we were all artists, because we were all lovers. We were one and the same. Everyone. It was such a universal discernment, that I was sure, no, I knew, that she just had had the same thought. DiannaÂs blue eyes immediately widened, her smile grew wider, and with a startled look on her face, she declared, ÂOh Len, I just realized something, listen to this!Â 
96	2	a	I knew that was cue for me to turn around and sit directly in front of her. She spoke animatedly, and eloquently elucidated to me my second realization: 
97	2	a	ÂLove is art, Len. Love is the abstraction of everything behind art.Â 
98	2	a	That made sense! I chimed in, ÂYes because we communicate what we hold dear to us, what weÂre passionate about!Â 
99	2	a	She nodded, ÂYes, exactly! And art is just the tangible expression of love. The physical in what connects us and makes us feel. And itÂs just so powerful, you know?Â 
100	2	a	This may sound like gibberish to you now, but it still makes perfect sense to me. To put it more fluently: art is a tangible manifestation of what arouses feeling in us, and regardless of what those feelings are, love is usually involved, as we create work based on things that we actually care about; while love is the conceptualized notion of all thatÂs behind artistic creation. See, it is an intelligible theory. 
101	2	a	Immediately after reaching that enlightening conclusion, Dianna felt at a good mental place and got out of the shower. I knew I needed to stay for longer, alone, and trip a little bit. I thought that acid was going to transport me places randomly, but I had complete control on the level of immersion I wanted to experiment with, and now it was the time to dive. I leaned back and assumed DiannaÂs old placement, but probably didnÂt look as majestic (my arms and legs are about half her lengthÂs!) 
102	2	a	But instead of being richly involved into another world, I remained in the dimension of feelings IÂd been previously exploring, until i closed my eyes. Closing my eyes was interesting. IÂd say I wasnÂt Tripping hard!!!1111,, but I definitely had compelling closed-eye visuals. It was mostly mandalas, and typical LSD-esque tubular designs, moving around in teal, golden orange, and this iridescent purple/magenta color. All the shades were extremely vivid, but the shape of what I was looking at exactly seemed unclear. It was all relatively dark, and I had to dig deep to let it fully overtake me. All in all, I thought that I hadnÂt taken enough of LucyÂs juice to be actually optically enthralled, but boy was I wrong. 
103	2	a	I decided IÂd had enough of looking for an outer body experience, to then end up finding spiral patterns. I felt weirdly jealous of Dianna, and how, even with just half a blotter, she was able to feel and envision so much more than me. Maybe a change of scenery would have helped, I considered, so, with the little dexterity I had left, I turned off the shower and got up, determined to go out...only to realize my clothes werenÂt there. 
104	2	a	ÂDianna!Â I called out.â¨I heard her laughing, ÂYes?Ââ¨ÂI think I left my clothes in your room... can I borrow some PJs, or something?Â I asked. I sounded very normal, which was strange. Was my trip already over? 
105	2	a	ÂSure, one minute!Â, I heard her exclaim from afar. She sounded so far, all the way in another room. Another room was another dimension... and I kept feeling bizarre: I wasnÂt high anymore, I told myself. Yet, the feeling of peculiarity and weirdness was still there. The whole reality around me was uneasy, and standing there in the cold, topless and in soaked shorts, didnÂt make things any un-uneasier. I decided to act sober, so that the trip would have further diminished, despite it had seemingly died out already. 
106	2	a	Again, time was confusing, so I donÂt know how much of it passed, but I stood there, like that, for a significant amount. I remember thinking how Dianna was taking forever, and I wanted to have some clothes on my body already! ÂDianna, can I borrow a towel, at least?Â I finally asked. 
107	2	a	ÂOh RIGHT. IÂm so sorry Len, this has all ben so confusing!Â I heard her, afar again. 
108	2	a	Her steps edged closer, with a tense kind of grace. She seemed to float amidst gravity, her euphoria lifting her up, as she opened the door. 
109	2	a	ÂHere,Â she handed me a large white t-shirt, you know one of those they hand you somewhere youÂve actually been to, along with a pair of checkered pink and black bottoms. They were a little large on my small frame, but it was comfortable. Actually, it felt amazing. Like every inch of the fabric was cuddling my body. A pajama acid hug. The whole thing was so pleasing that I didnÂt even mind my wet, long hair looking especially brown and curly in its state. IÂd stood there so long it wasnÂt even dripping anymore, just a little damp. Not to mention, my underwear had gotten soaked with DiannaÂs shorts, from before (we never took our bottoms off, in the shower) and so I was having my first, and painfully necessary, college-commando experience. Even letting my lady parts breathe helped me calm down. 
110	2	a	When I realized I was done dressing up, and had to head to DiannaÂs room, I committed myself to keep what ended up being my sober-faÃ§ade up. I can be completely unaffected by all of this, if I choose to, I reminded myself. So, one step after the other...- this is so weird.
111	2	a	As soon as I opened up the door, and saw Louise sitting there with Frey still, I knew this wasnÂt over. It was too weird to be over. Too unusual. Too peculiar. My steps were fragmented, and tentative, and everything seemed suddenly extremely uninviting. The kitchen didnÂt look like a kitchen, the common room didnÂt look like the common room weÂd been hanging out in, and DiannaÂs room was another dimension. The dimension where my sisters and I had to step and be together in, immediately, I thought. I needed someone that could relate to what I was experiencing as soon as possible.
112	2	a	I walked in, to SummerÂs velvety voice greeting me with gusto, ÂLen, wazzup!Ââ¨I felt myself frowning, despite not wanting to, ÂThis is so weird,Â was all I could say. Summer grinned, her blue eyes trying to perceive exactly what my state of mindÂs valence was: good or bad weird? As if IÂd just read her mind, I added, ÂGood weird, but still weirdÂ. She nodded, and returned to whatever it was she had been doing on DiannaÂs bed. 
113	2	a	I think I should mention there were two beds on the room, positioned parallel to each other, with a vast walking space in the middle. I sat on the left side, on DiannaÂs roommateÂs bed (whose name I forget, as she wasnÂt there that night), while Summer had been chilling on DiannaÂs mattress, which was so messy that I think part of it might have been exposed. Still, not any messier than my mattress. 
114	2	a	ÂMaybe itÂs the SSRIs, you know? I read some people canÂt really trip on those,Â Dianna said, as she restlessly walked around the room. She kept stepping back and forth, while scratching and caressing her body. I was past that phase, but I still stroked my cheeks and chin way too much for my own good. 
115	2	a	ÂYeah, I donÂt know. ItÂs not like IÂm not feeling it, just not really anything too intense. IÂm not affected by it.Â Summer said. I connected the dots, and realized that Summer had probably lamented not being high, while I was still in the shower. I related to that, since it was just what IÂd been thinking of, but things were about to change. Plus, quite frankly, Summer has a high tolerance when it comes to substances, albeit being even a couple of pounds less than me, and roughly the same height. I knew my girl, and I knew that merely half a blotter wasnÂt going to, necessarily, be life-altering for her. 
116	2	a	Me, on the other hand... I was a different story that was about to turn to its climaxing page. I am known to be moody, and it isnÂt unusual for my state of mind to shift rapidly from hour to hour, depending on the circumstances. Acid really didnÂt help with that. Its little lens zoomed in that shift, and before I could even process what my name was, I was back in the feels-dimension. 
117	2	a	I felt everything. Everything that was inside that relatively small dorm room was transmitting some sort of energy that I absorbed in subtle, but extremely potent ways. Every single entity in the room, be it Summer or Dianna, a sweater on the floor, a sham-less pillow on the bed, or a picture of an asian little girl, was feeling with me everything. No, I guess a more accurate description would be that every single entity contributed to characterizing the roomÂs feel, and that feel in turn affected me, as the setting was pivotal to the experience. I was the room, or better, I was what I felt like in the room. 
118	2	a	I looked around me, and the weirdest part was that all of these feelings came about on a purely superficial level. It wasnÂt like I had immersed myself in the details surrounding many of the times thrown all over the place. Just by looking, just by simply noticing one, tiny little thing, the whole feel became different. It became richer, it expanded and grew inside me, until I couldnÂt process it anymore.
119	2	a	I chose to focus on illustrations and decorations, since they were mere replicas of reality, and everything seemed like an unauthentic copy at the moment. Dianna had decorated her side of the cream-colored wall with a series of Keith Haring-themed designs, but one of them particularly stood out to me: it was a blue faceless stickman (his typical shapes) standing on a huge marine-mammal looking yellow creature. Its eyes were widened, just like its mouth, and it seemed like it was suffering from the weight, or perhaps the supposed motion, of the person on top of it. It made me very pensive. 
120	2	a	At first, it sparked within me very literal thoughts. I imagined humans, and how terrible our relationship with animals really is, despite how much we pride ourselves in being the Âprotectors of the seaÂ, which made my vibe drop significantly. I thought about a particular instance in Sixth Grade, when one of our Middle School Orientation teachers had forced all of the grade in the our auditorium to view a then-recent video of seal violence in the arctic. I remember how disgusted and appalled I felt, but that only translated into resignation - not even sadness, just a desolate feeling as I decided that it was in human nature to be cruel, and not every animal could be free. 
121	2	a	It was in human nature to be cruel. Like Seth. Seth had been cruel to me. And he always popped up. I donÂt know why I had some sort of notion that I was over him, or that drugs would have made me over him, because despite the deeply-felt heart-to-heart IÂd had with Summer the previous day, he was still there! Still monopolizing and dictating me and making me wonder, what had I done wrong? Why had I lost him. Why didnÂt I see him anymore. Wait. I was the one not seeing him anymore, not the other way around! 
122	2	a	As I still stared at the blue stickman, I realized I was it. I was the stickman and Seth was the little seal, because I had always been on top of him (technically, in more ways than one, but IÂm trying to be serious here, so IÂm keeping it on a strictly emotional level). Yes! I thought to myself, yes, yes! I was the one with the power, and he was just a tiny little fragment of my life. 
123	2	a	And thatÂs when my third realization hit me: nothing really mattered. Everything seemed extremely small and insignificant, all of my relationship problems, I mean. Seth didnÂt matter anymore, he was just another guy. A guy IÂd been heavily infatuated with, granted, but at the end of the day just another stupid, socially impaired guy. He was going to be part of my journey through life, of course, and he had changed a lot of me within this journey - but he was just a part. A preLy short-lived part, at that. 
124	2	a	And soon, everything in the room became scarily meaningless. 
125	2	a	Now, IÂve mentioned in various other parts of this report how meaninglessness was a crucial component to most of what I felt... but now, it had become extremely so. Not only was I unable to process the inner meaning of everything, but it ceased to have a purpose altogether. Everything was nothing, at the same time. 
126	2	a	IÂve always been a bit of a nihilist, but I never realized how much frustration this could have ended up costing a day-tripper me. I looked at the Keith Haring designs, all of them, and they bothered me because they were so open ended, they meant so much, yet nothing at the same time. The conflict my mind was feeling, in searching for a meaning that was everything and everyone, and nowhere and nobody, simultaneously, made me feel so irritated that I had to engage with humans. 
127	2	a	I hadnÂt realized it, but Summer had approached me, while I was feeling the empowerment (I think I mentioned to her how I was the blue man, and Seth the seal, my seal). She smiled really wide, and, I donÂt know why, but my vision chose to fall somewhere it never does: her nostrils. I kind of noticed how Summer had particularly big nostrils at that angle - she was looking down at me - and the blackness of her nostril was just spooky. The shape of it, weirdly angular, and her flesh so pale around it... it just made me feel gloomy and odd, and I perceived a macabre presence. The macabre presence of death - of the endless blackness in her little nasal holes.
128	2	a	ÂI saw death. In your nostril!Â, just like that. Fragmented sentence escaped day-tripper me. 
129	2	a	That made her crack up big time. Summer quickly erupted in a long, loud string of laughter that made me feel, all of a sudden, warm inside again. The human presence, the human spirit, or humanity in general - they all reminded me that we werenÂt robots, that we werenÂt programmed to be cruel, to loathe, to hate. That was another instance where Lucy reminded me to love more, and hate less. Even SummerÂs death-shaped nostril deserved some love, because it was part of my best friend, in the good and the bad. 
130	2	a	And love was quick to wrap me up in its arms again. Love was quick to take me in, with all of the wonderful other stem of heart-warming emotions IÂd associated with it. I thought about my reality, and how much love I felt in this new place, a new place IÂd moved to in a whim, surrounded by people I didnÂt know, and how they did love me already, and how I loved them. I felt far, again. 
131	2	a	I was far away from my sassy mother, from my hot-headed father, from my sweet doggie. I was far away from the incidents with my friends... but what got me going was the fact that I was so far away from the friend I loved the most: Lorence. Back in my home country, IÂd met Lorence about a year earlier, at my former best friendÂs party. Lorence and I quickly bonded over music, and subsequently became bandmates. Throughout the year, our relationship had tightened, and 
132	2	a	he was (still is) one of the people I cared to keep up with and carry on in my life. He had been close friends with Frey as well. And it all connected - the meaningless meaning was meaningful again. I realized how much I loved him, and how much love there was between us despite the distance: what a beautiful friendship - he is my brother. 
133	2	a	And that, thatÂs what made me break down in tears. 
134	2	a	Summer had been making some videos of us, (she still saw herself as the Âsober oneÂ, and Dianna was sitting in a corner, still in the grip of the mysterious ants that had made her manically break down in laughter) so that we could watch them afterwards, sober. I have seen these videos numerous times, and, according to the footage, I was laughing initially. 
135	2	a	Something happened along the way that prompted me to fall into thought (this is probably when I looked over at the Keith Haring sticker), and there is a pretty disturbing moment where I hit my fist repeatedly against the bed, while moaning in frustration. I think thatÂs when the lack of sense of reality got really intense, and everything felt like Âtoo muchÂ, so nothing it meant was ever enough. I think that was my release of the weirdness. After that fisting session is where I break down and cry. You can also hear Summer, and her lovely voice, singing to me a kind of lullaby, and exclaiming, ÂWow, youÂre having a revelation, arenÂt you?Â 
136	2	a	I nodded, and, apparently, felt very uncomfortable at the fact that she was filming, since I exclaimed, ÂStop looking at me! Stop filming me! Stop fucking filming this!Â as I wiped a tear away from my eye. Summer is Summer, so she obviously didnÂt. I looked straight at the camera for (what I realized later were) several seconds before resuming the tear-fest and, with Dianna- like wavy arm motions, announced ÂIÂm letting it go; so much.Â And I was. I let go of Seth, I let go of the drama, of glorifying nostalgic pasts that had never existed in the first place. And it was beautiful. 
137	2	a	The video appeared to end right when we all began to laugh at my hideous gospel-like intonation. I remembered we laughed extremely loudly, to the point where I think Louise and Frey must have gotten scared at the door. Or maybe not. Probably not, no, they probably knew even better than us. 
138	2	a	So, I just told you what I was experiencing at the moment, and what I was physically doing. Notice how different those episodes and reflections seemed? On acid, progression and synchronicity donÂt really exist. A thought flows into the other, which flows into the other, and it all melts together in reactions and feelings. So, while this was going on, I still had the ÂweÂre all so small!Â realization fresh in my mind, which made me cry even more because I saw our reality as perfect, as little, as functional - when compared to the space and solar system. Because no matter small, it was still all love and beauty. 
139	2	a	Unexpectedly, (by now, at least) I donÂt know how long the crying went on for. I donÂt think it was that much, the tears were quick and cold, but it was so intense it slowed down. I cried every single happy feeling I had ever had in my entire life... or so it seemed like I was doing. It was like every happy moment in my life, which had caused me to feel happy in the past, was uniting in a explosion of euphoria and fulfillment. Through the tears I was releasing all of it: I was crying my life away. 
140	2	a	The emotional liberation I partook in had definitely drained my mind, and I was ready to lean back and trip it out. I sprinted to the living room, and, with shaky hands, picked up my laptop and headphones. Back in DiannaÂs room, she was lying back on her bed, making funny faces and giggling as she stared at the ceiling. I decided to do the same thing, but with probably much different music. 
141	2	a	What to listen to became an overwhelming dilemma. I had awaited this moment for so long, that when it actually came, I was extremely conflicted. Since thinking about all of the possibilities overwhelmed me, I decided to let my thoughts melt into my one catchphrase for the trip, ÂIÂm so farÂ, I whispered, sighing. Immediately, I knew that I had to put on Spring Hall Convert by Deerhunter, as the lyrics of the outro clearly sing out, ÂSo far away...Â. 
142	2	a	I remember once reading, when I was fourteen, on the lead singerÂs blog, about the origins of that song. There was a bright picture to go along with it of a girl; she was spreading her palms open wide below her chin, letting her long fingers frame her face, as a light shone directly on her peaceful expression. She had her eyes closed, and a soK, serene smile. According to the singer, Bradford Cox, that song was actually about states of consciousness, and morphine, (he has MarphanÂs, so he wrote it at the hospital, while he was very sick) - but the picture was taken during an acid trip. During my own trip, all of those elements linked together: the peacefulness, the serenity, the pink shining light, the states of consciousness... that was the quintessential acid song, and if you ever trip yourself- I urge you to listen to it. ItÂll enhance the experience, no doubt. I mean, itÂs preTy amazing to me on its own, and itÂs very amazing to me on weed... but on acid? It was fucking incredible. It was auditory LSD, it was auditory art, it was auditory love. 
143	2	a	As I was transported through my hearing into another dimension, I decided to let sight join me in my venture. Turns out, visuals were much easier to attain once I just looked for them. The ceiling above us was this textured, off-white-yet-off-cream color, but the various granules of shadows that hit it transformed into shapes in no time. They began waving around, enlarging and retreating, a little like the sink before. It didnÂt take too long for them to become mitochondria-like pieces of paisley, and then little snakes! They had a very specific green-yellow- purple color scheme, which I found wildly entertaining: why would I remember color theory while tripping out? Because this is a magical substance, my friends. 
144	2	a	The shapes kept vibrating and moving around to the rhythm of the music, and I was in heaven. I was away. I was so far. They put on a real show, not too long after that. They spun, circled, and jumped at a steady and wondrously syncopated pace. It was like they were putting up a performance especially for me. They danced for me and my mind only. For the benefit of my entertainment, there I was. And there were them. Even though I thought I was the only person to see them, they didnÂt feel like they were part of my mind. They felt like something else. Utterly and entirely disconnected with my cervical perception. And looking for them was strenuous. Strenuous, but amazing, and well-worth the effort. Truly mind-blowing. 
145	2	a	We remained like that until I had to change the song, and thatÂs the first time I had access to a clock ever since we dropped. After calling Dianna, who had still been staring at the ceiling and enjoying herself quite a bit, on her bed, by tapping her feet, I felt like I need to let all of my sisters know, ÂGirls... my digital clock here says itÂs only ti AM. ItÂs only ti ftUYS!Â. IÂm not sure what I was expecting, probably some sort of insane time vortex to swallow me, and let me out when it had passed through normal perception. It felt like the whole night had passed. Like a thousand nights had passed, actually. How could it only be one? 
146	2	a	My question wasnÂt really answered, as Mark stumbled upon the door of DiannaÂs room, opening it loudly, ÂDianna!Â He exclaimed, reaching out for the bed, ÂYou have no idea... I was editing the footage for the, um, the movie... then, then I decided to smoke up a bit before coming over. So I got the munchies, and I raided my suiteÂs fridge for something to eat... I found these cookies, and they were so good... I had like three of those, man. But they were edibles... so IÂm about to pass out...Â his speech wasnÂt upbeat as usual, but lethargically entranced into the dimension of sleep. 
147	2	a	I could imagine what being high and sleepy on weed would have been like, but I was so far! I was on acid, and that sight just saddened me. Weed seemed to be dull and boring, while I was in that state. DonÂt get me wrong, I would have gladly smoked my way out during the come down, but all the euphoria and inspiration I was feeling on acid would have been dulled out at that point, and by then I realized that this trip wasnÂt about enhancing visuals (which weed would have definitely aided me in), no, this trip was me exploring the realm of feelings. A realm I donÂt feel incredibly comfortable with on a daily basis. 
148	2	a	Because IÂm not particularly attached to Mark, and because I definitely didnÂt feel like I could confront repressed feelings in front of him, I knew, as soon as he lied on the bed and Dianna sat next to him, that I had to leave. I couldnÂt be in that room with Mark. 
149	2	a	Everything that was beautiful became corrupted. All the feelings of peace and empowerment were wiped out by anxiety and weakness. MarkÂs energy wasnÂt my energy, and I wanted to leave immediately. 
150	2	a	ÂI...I have to go. Now.Â I declared, clumsily grabbing my headphones and my laptop, and heading straight out of the room. Summer decided to leave the lovebirds alone, and followed me back into the common area. I read up that whenever the trip takes a sudden, negative turn, it was a good idea to change my surroundings. I headed out in the hallway, in my pajamas. I had made the smart decision to ÂborrowÂ a blanket from DiannaÂs and wrapped myself around it. 
151	2	a	I went back to the spot where we looked at cars, sat on the railing by the balcony, and realized Summer had followed me there. She sang such a beautiful melody, I canÂt recall what it was, but her voice was beautiful and it made it sound... so far. I was far. I was far from her. I was far from singing. (I should mention, I used to sing too... in New York I still havenÂt goTen the opportunity, or the balls, really, to go for it, and her nonchalance while exposing such talent brought me to a ÂrealizationÂ - the use of the quote marks is pivotal, in this case).
152	2	a	I teared up at the thought, and then attempted to present it audibly, ÂI know my calling,Â I felt the speed at which the cold tear dripped down my cheek, ÂIÂm a messenger; IÂm not an artist... I just wasnÂt meant to beÂ I repeated bitterly. Summer frowned, ÂWhat? What makes you say that?Â she asked. She seemed visibly startled, like IÂd just asked why it was wrong to commit murder. 
153	2	a	ÂIÂve been a sponge for this whole trip. IÂve just been absorbing so much, and you girls produce! You and Dianna, you guys are so talented, and I just want to know people as talented as you. My talents, well, they donÂt really come through. I quit them, because they didnÂt fit in my life, and it means theyÂre not important to me. IÂm a messenger, I hold a voice, not the voiceÂ, yeah that should be close to what I said. I wasnÂt really explaining myself, as much as I was giving her excuses on my artistic laziness. To this day, this remains one of the most daunting moments of my life. I was so sure my future and destiny would have led me to a longing for creativity myself, that it scared me. Forever wishing, forever absorbing, and never creating. 
154	2	a	Summer was not convinced at all by my argument, but had probably realized how so far I was, that she didnÂt have the strength to prove me wrong. We theorized on the nature of direction (ÂWhy do cars even move?Â), the meaning of light (ÂWhy are lights on, why are lights on...!Â), and the altitude of New York City (ÂImagine jumping...!Â), before heading back inside. I was much more inquisitive than Summer, who, at every question, decided to wisely admit she just ÂdidnÂt know!Â with a smile of sincerity painted on her face. 
155	2	a	Once we were back in, I noticed Frey and Louise had put up some of our creations from earlier on during the night. They also showed us the results of their drawing game, which were interesting, to say the least! They were fun to look at, although they made me feel weird. As always, the acid-kind of artificial unsettlement in a reality that did not compute. At all. Louise then began to critique and comment them in a way I found so bizarrely formal, ÂI like the negative space up here!Â she said, pointing to the white part of the swirls that IÂd been working on right after dropping. I hadnÂt even realized IÂd left a space... ÂWe should hang it up!Â she suggested. Summer seemed to think it was a great idea, but to me the painting was mediocre, and I laughed at the thought of someone wanting to look at it everyday. 
156	2	a	We then stumbled upon other swirls IÂd made, on another piece of cardboard, which looked weirdly familiar. ÂOh my god, this is definitely a thing... like a person, look at the face. ItÂs coolÂ Frey added. I inspected the lines and the strokes, then seeing that yes, it was someone. I donÂt know whom, but someone indeed. A blue face on a sea of red and gold features. Picturesque. Too bad I donÂt know where that one ended up, that one was the only one worth looking, I thought. 
157	2	a	Immediately after that, Louise and Frey adorably followed through their nightly routine of sleeping. Frey was going to sleep with her in her bed, and they were both going to crash. I was comforted that no normal people were going to be awake now. I needed to retreat into acid, after that intense hallway calling. Summer and I sat on the couch, and with shaky hands, began to type out our feelings. Me by pressing fingers, on this very same keyboard IÂm currently pressing fingers on, and her by tapping her phoneÂs screen. She came up with a magnificent poem, of glistening quality. Me, on the other hand, I did.. well, I did this: 
158	2	a	WE CAN BE EACH OTHER WITHOUT OUR BODIES.... BUT WE REPRESENT MORE. 
159	2	a	IF I TOOK MY SYMBOLS OUT OF ME - LIKE MY CLOTHES - WOULD I STILL REMAIN? THEY REPRESENT ME THEY REPRESENT ME AND I KNOW BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS AND WE ALL ARE AND I AM BECAUSE I KEEP BEING. I KEEP BEING AND I KEEP LOVING AND I KEEP EXPRESSING ALL THE LOVE AND ALL I WANT WITHOUT ME.'
160	2	a	I guess that was an attempt at explaining the fourth realization of the night, which dawned upon me as I was pressing said keys! I realized that on a day-to-day basis it was only what I had to define me, not who I was. It wasnÂt about my qualities, or my personality traits, no, it was about my clothes and my nail polish and my makeup and... it couldnÂt be that way. Not anymore. This experience was way too spiritual for me to deny my existence as a spirit. As a formerly incredibly nihilist-absurdist person, - I find comfort in chaos - I just couldnÂt accept meaninglessness anymore, no I had to build up my soul and believe in something greater than me. Something intangible. I needed to be more. 
161	2	a	Back in DianneÂs room, we could infer what was happening from the noise. She was clearly trying to get a quickie on with Mark, ÂPlease, please, please!Â we heard her tender voice beg, but it was to no avail. Mark was braindead on the sleep-syndrome, and not much fun was to be expected from more time there. She then walked out and came to check up on us. She looked visibly less literally ÂantsyÂ and euphoric than sheÂd been all night. And thatÂs when I had the most sparkling, brilliant idea of the night, ÂLetÂs go out,Â I proposed. 
162	2	a	Summer, who wrote a play called Insomnia: The Musical, was clearly in for aimless walking at night on acid, and Dianna agreed on the premise that we were going out to pick up food for her. Since I hadnÂt had anything since the sushi, and had to keep my motor running for the trip, I agreed. We quickly went back to DiannaÂs to pick up our clothes - we all gave up on bras... or other soaked underwear by that point - and put them on. I wasnÂt the least bit impaired, nor did I have trouble putting my clothes on, but I was still so far. I was still in an impossibly weird, nonsensical, and removed abysmal world of non-realities. 
163	2	a	I looked at the first ÂpainingÂ IÂd made, as soon as I had my beanie back on. My way-too-material heels squeaked on the ground, and my way-too-material brown lipstick was thoughtlessly re- applied by me, with ease. This was almost automatic to me, and thatÂs when the painting spoke. 
164	2	a	ÂLen,Â it called me. Now, itÂs not like I could hear the painting as a specific person, I knew it was mostly me doing the talking... but it seemed to come from the direction of the painting. So I aTribute the conversation I had as a conversation with a painting. 
165	2	a	ÂLen, you made me!Â, it reminded me, ÂYou made me. You created ME. You can create. You can be!Â that was true. Dianna and Summer had noticed my affinity towards the painting, and called my name numerous times as I headed over to touch the paper, ÂSummer is right. YouÂre wrongÂ yeah, yeah I was! Just because I was experiencing so much, and forced to absorb it, it didnÂt mean I was never going to be able to produce artistic material ever again. Much on the contrary... 
166	2	a	ÂYou can do an be whatever you want! YouÂre here. If you made it here, you can definitely make anything. Stop trying to stop yourself. Quit qui^ng...Â the voice of the painting grew fainter, and as I kept stroking it, it has said whatever it had to say, and quieted down in my head. 
167	2	a	I looked back at the girls, who were still attentively watching me, ÂThe painting just spoke! It spoke to me. The painting spoke to me! It told me that you were right, Summer, you were right and that messenger shit is stupid. I can be and do what I wantÂ I declared my fifth realization, happily. If I have enough inspiration to produce, I will. Eventually. 
168	2	a	ÂTHANK YOU!Â Summer conceded loudly. And now, it was us against the City. 
169	2	a	This might, perhaps, get a little repetitive, but once we had made the decision to go to food (yeah, that was our destination), we felt, preTy much, sober. This might have been because, once you go back to a place of lucidity and intelligible, non-crowded thinking, it is hard to accept you might fall back in the trip. 
170	2	a	The type of hunger that we were feeling, by the way, was very unlike standard munchies from Mary-Jane. LucyÂs hunger was more along the lines of knowing that we were going to be awake for a long time, and having to keep our bodies running, in order not to fall asleep. 
171	2	a	Throughout the whole day, IÂd only had a Special-K Bar, coffee and the sushi from before, so I wanted to fill myself a bit. Just a quick snack: not like I needed food, but I wanted to nourish my inner self. 
172	2	a	When we headed downstairs, I remembered how I, originally (before the trip commenced), felt extremely worried at the idea of going out, or even having to sign myself in and show my face to the guards, high. My pupils were as wide as saucers, and I was still very physically tense and jittery. Thankfully, going out was actually painless. I tried to use my University ID to walk out, only to be reminded by Dianna that I didnÂt need it to exit... yeah, still very much not sober, am I? 
173	2	a	As soon as we went outside, in the cold breeze of early October, the wet tips of my hair tingled, and I felt almost like a sphere of energy forming inside me. It was regenerating, and it made me immediately fall within the trip again. I looked at cars, and how their bumpers looked like faces. I smiled and waved at them. Cars were like domestic animals: they reflected the people inside, so if I made friends with the cars, I would have made friends with everyone inside them. 
174	2	a	My childhood memories were back in the prime-time periphery of my mind. I remembered, back when I used to play this game, when I was in grade school, where I waved at drivers in the highway. Sometimes, they thought it was cute, you know? They smiled and waved right back. Others, just ignored us. Luckily nothing ever obscene happened (letÂs thank the innocence of my home country for a second here). Anyways, the cars were the owners. The owners were people. I was a person. They were like me! They were like me, and they also lived in my world. A sense of belonging in Union Square suddenly washed up over my body, and New York City had never felt more like my home. I was that little kid on the highway again, seeing everything, and recognizing it as new. I suddenly wondered, what would smoking be like? 
175	2	a	I picked a cigarette from my fresh pack of Marlboro 27s (oh, Europe thank you for making me smoke), and lit it up. Let me just say, even sober, I have a peculiar relationship with smoking- time. Some cigarettes burn away within the shuffle of one song when I commute home, while others seem to take ages to ash out as I walk through avenues and avenues. This one, to my amazement, was a strange example of the laTer category. 
176	2	a	It lasted forever. Maybe it was because Dianna was in a hurry to get to CVS - the closest destination to pick up some quick snacks at - but I felt like I stood there, huffing and puffing out in the middle of the night, for a very long time. Smoking always mellows me out significantly - I mean IÂve been smoking for almost a year now, and sometimes, I still feel dizzy and lightheaded from cigarettes. Drifting in philosophical endeavors was calming, and as always, a given, as soon as I was mentally solo. 
177	2	a	Any activity I performed by myself encouraged me to re-evaluate my relationship with others around me, and as soon as Dianna and Summer began to walk around and observe the city lights without me, I just kept studying my cigarette and asked myself, ÂWhat the hell is the point of smoking anyways?Â I might have said it out loud, but I canÂt remember. I smiled ironically, realizing how helpless I was in determining the answer to that conundrum. 
178	2	a	I walked over to Summer, and, holding my cancer stick, declared amusingly, ÂThis is the most meaningless act someone can ever performÂ. She smiled and raised her shoulders. What I loved about Summer is that she never had forced me out of my habits: here she was, completely relating to what I said, even if it was un-relatable for her. Nevertheless, it was pointless for something to be pointless on acid, so it suddenly came to me. 
179	2	a	The packs of Lucky Strikes that Lorence and I had ÂsplitÂ (he bought them, and basically picked a couple up and leK the rest for me, that bastard), social cigarettes over beer outside in the cold winter, nights of post-joint chain-smoking all summer long... it was all in my past, and it all shaped who I was. It was a stupid habit, yeah sure, but one that I could not shake. A little passport of memories that had impacted me just as much as my clothes, or ideologies. 
180	2	a	Summer still stood silent, and I smiled at her, even more abused when I added, ÂBut it does have meaning... for me,Â She looked back and raised her eyebrows, ÂReally?Â she asked. I couldnÂt tell whether she was actually interested, or in her own world, faking it, but I thought it was important to respond, and present my sixth realization, ÂIt keeps my home alive, within me. ThatÂs what habits do. Habits are just our ways to remind ourselves that weÂre our own home. TheyÂre familiar, and keep a bridge between all the change... they just donÂt change.Â Obviously I was speaking for myself: a lot of people have found health and benefits in stopping to smoke, or whatever nasty thing they might have been doing. But I am not planning on it, I need to remind myself that I have a home within me, one that wonÂt change no matter where I go. 
181	2	a	When I was finally done, we were ready to walk inside CVS and get something in our tummies (honestly, smoking has never made me feel less hungry, if I really wanted food), just as we were stopped by a young woman wearing a maxi-skirt and a brown leather jacket. She stopped us when she heard Dianna discussing the possibility of going to a more traditional restaurant, where we could sit down and be served. 
182	2	a	ÂOh girls, if youÂre looking for somewhere to eat you could go to the CafeteriaÂ she said. IÂm sure whatever the name of the place was, it wasnÂt Cafeteria. Something along the lines of that, though. Dianna smiled and Summer responded, ÂOh we were just there earlier today, it was great!Â 
183	2	a	ÂAh, shucks!Â she said. She was holding a large tote bag, which she pushed over her shoulder. I observed her quietly, my first stranger on acid! She looked so quintessentially human, and in that basic humanity, I found an endless sense of peace and beauty. It was almost artistic, and art was love, so I quickly started to feel an overwhelming rush of love for that woman, ÂYouÂre beautifulÂ I remarked, interrupting the conversation she was having with Dianna, which was probably normal and boring anyways. 
184	2	a	ÂOh wow, thank you!Â she said. I donÂt think IÂd make the same observation in a sober state - this girl had crooked teeth, unruly frizzy hair, and was slightly short and stubby. Yet she was perfect, naturally effortless in her harmonious self, and I couldnÂt hold it in from her. As she walked away, she recommended some website for...something? Like a natural-remedy doctor, I think. I didnÂt know, neither did I care too much. I kept watching her small feet stumble through in heavy, dark boots. How could I tell her how faultlessly she moved? ÂYour color is green!Â I announced as she headed in the subway. She frowned, and was probably a little weirded out, ÂAh. I guess IÂll keep that in mind!Â, she said skeptically. Maybe she thought I was stoned. Maybe she recognized my condition! 
185	2	a	Dianna laughed loudly as soon as the girl was gone. ÂAnd your color is teal!Â I said to Summer. This color assignment wasnÂt really based on anything more than my personal state of mind. I donÂt normally think people have ÂcolorsÂ, and nor do I Âsee aurasÂ or anything... everyone simply had a color that communicated their personality.
186	2	a	How I came to those conclusions, I wouldnÂt know. It was some trippy synesthetic association I embraced, not much more to explain. 
187	2	a	The girls agreed with me, and quickly jumped on the bandwagon, ÂWhatÂs my color, Len?Â asked Dianna. I looked at her, her big, welcoming smile and tall, yet delicate, frame. ÂYouÂre like, a light... light blue.Â She nodded slowly, probably trying to envision herself as a light blue, ÂYeah!Â, she acknowledged my judgment. ÂI can see that tooÂ, Summer added. Dianna suddenly looked at me and emphatically remarked, ÂYouÂre definitely red. Like an intense, blood-red.Â I smiled, ÂCrimsonÂ I translated. I stroked my leK wrist, where my King Crimson-themed Larks Tongues on Aspic taToo lied. Man do I love that band. 
188	2	a	Then, finally, we walked inside CVS to get something to eat. LucyÂs distractions were entertaining, but we still had a goal. Humanity pulsed within that store, which I never notice on a daily basis. I always thought that CVS, WalgreenÂs, or Duane and Reade were very plastic- looking places, sterile conglomerates for munchie-related needs. But in that moment, it definitely wasnÂt. They were still places for our needs, of course, but they were human, and life flowed within them. The music that played, some sort of 80s female-sung pop, was being chanted by a human, for humans. The magazines I looked at depicted humans, and other humans read them. CVS represented the mirror to my little human reality - a small corner on the small universe we inhabit. Tininess was incredibly comfortable, and incredibly human. Yet, not many of the commodities in the store made sense to me; in fact, I was still having a hard time processing the point and reality of objects around me, but I was still connected to this world. Undoubtedly so. Sadly enough, Dianna immediately realized that she the food was barred: ÂGuys, the food is barred down. LetÂs go upÂ she proposed, running towards the escalators. I knew the chances of us finding food upstairs were slim - the second floor mostly stocked up drugstore beauty products and pharmacy-related health items. But I wouldnÂt have missed the escalators for the world. Only the one going upward was properly working, and it felt amazing to be basically lifted up; so different from the everyday, almost chore-like, feeling of upward escalators - I was ascending. 
189	2	a	As we thought, upstairs was just makeup... and I had already too much of that, so we went straight down. Going down wasnÂt as magical as going up, since I actually had to use my legs. It was heavy-handed and slow. As I tiptoed my black heeled mini-boots on the pavement, I felt like I was a mammoth approaching. Yet, weÂd just crossed another bridge on our quest... it was taking us somewhere else, which made me thrilled and excited. 
190	2	a	Time was not one of our concerns on acid, so Dianna suggested us heading to Grand Central Station. I think she had some sort of asian or indian food craving, and told us that they had all kinds of restaurants inside. Off we went, just to Âcheck it outÂ, first and foremost. My friends and I like to keep our options open when we go out: we rarely make plans or agree on timing, but in that moment, it seemed like we had all the time in the world, to see all it could have offered us. 
191	2	a	We entered the subway with dwindling conviction. I marched onwards, assertively leading the way, while Dianna followed in a haze of longer steps, but Summer seemed to hesitate behind us. As soon as we arrived underground, she stopped to look at us in the eye, ÂI donÂt have my phone,Â she remarked. Dianna smiled, adding ÂNeither do I!Â 
192	2	a	Summer turned to me, ÂLen?Â, she called. I had considered taking my phone with me to blast some trip tunes as we walked along, but it felt unauthentic. So far, acid had warped the reality around me in a way that I had never experienced before, and I wanted to see what it could do with the natural sounds and rhythms of the city street-life. Reality needed to bend itself, in order for me to be legitimately surprised by it, and if I was listening to music, I would have altered the process drastically. So, in answer to Summer, ÂNah, no phone on meÂ. 
193	2	a	ÂOne of us should have a phone. I think IÂll just go get mine from upstairs. ItÂs also a good idea to let Louise, Frey, or Mark know that weÂre going outÂ she said. Her argument seemed reasonable, but I was able to tackle it, for the sake of our destination, ÂFrey and Louise are probably asleep, and Mark totally crashed on that bed, though. Do you think we really need to wake them up? WeÂre just going to go to Grand Central, grab a bite, and come back.Â I made it sound so easy, and it was... for people not on psychedelic drugs. 
194	2	a	What followed was the most lingering moment of the Trip, the most annoying part of it all - climbing the stairs up, and down, up, and down. Dianna and Summer could not, for the life of themselves, make a sensible decision over whether to get the phones or not. I wasnÂt going to go, regardless: IÂd made my decision, and I needed to progress and move the night forward. What frustrated me about them two, in that moment in particular, was the fact that they were messing with the flow of time and events. They kept going back, and forward, wasting precious minutes, and unable to decide upon a direction. Thankfully, under my council, we decided to all ditch phones and embark on our little technicolor adventure. 
195	2	a	If I had to choose one single adjective to describe sitting in that subway, IÂd pick climactic. This is interesting, since taking public transport is one of the most bland things we do, on an everyday basis, or so I thought. I mean, if I were to take the subway today, IÂm preTy sure IÂd still feel preTy bored with the experience, but there is something undoubtedly fascinating with sharing space amongst strangers - united by the need for a destination. The subway appeared to me as a metaphor for my trip. It was a very paradoxical and meta-moment. 
196	2	a	I looked around, wondering how frightened or foolish I looked, as I couldnÂt help but feel extreme amazement: American trains were so different from the ones in my hometown. The digital destination maps, the clear lights, the improvised ads... it all made me curiously compelled... because, yet again, none of it made any sense, or mattered. The subway was a powerful metaphor, of course, but I still couldnÂt process it in terms of its separate components. I remember, particularly, how startled I was by the mechanics of transportation. It seemed like such complicated subject matter that I felt a deep respect towards whomever was in charge of taking care of it. 
197	2	a	On a more personal level, I suddenly started to stare at the two middle-aged men sitting in front of me: one of them looked Hispanic and pensive, while the other was a sleepy Asian. Such different people, probably with different lives, and different destinations. Yet for a few moments, they sat next to each other - closer than they must have goTen to the ones they actually longed for. We were all heading somewhere - to progress, to paTerns, to dreams. Their destination was just the same as mine, fulfillment. 
198	2	a	I honestly cannot find the missing link between this consideration, and what then evolved to become my seventh realization on acid. I immediately knew, the more I looked at those men, that I wanted no more secrets in my life, no more games, no more lies. I just wanted to be clean, out in the open with all of my feelings and emotions (something IÂve always kind of struggled with). Secrets seemed like such an immature and trivial convention, with their scope being solely to prevent bonding, and deeper connections, with others. The only way to form these relationships was by being raw, and true to myself. To all of me. And that made me smile a lot. 
199	2	a	I thought about the mess that took place back home, before I leK, and once again, I felt surprisingly good about it. Originally, I was apprehensive and almost threatened by the possibility of that incident enticing bad thoughts, but it really didnÂt. I felt clean about it, because I had come clean for what I did. I had confessed and stated the truth, and I was so happy that it had actually taken place, because it gave me a chance to realize who my real friends, through it all, actually had been. I felt lighter, more genuine, more real. 
200	2	a	Once our stop was up, we exited right at Grand Central. No surprise to me, the station was closed. ÂOh crap!Â, Dianna exclaimed, ÂI forgot itÂs 3:30, and it closes at 3!Â she added, looking alarmed. But just as we were about to lose our peppy, wheat-blonde torch to light up our nightÂs attitude, her sunshiny smile came right back up on her face, ÂLetÂs go to Times Square!Â 
201	2	a	Without a word, Summer and I both knew that was exactly where we had to go. The premise of being in the most famous visually appealing place in the world, on the most famous visually appealing substance in the world, was alluring the three of us in the same exact way. And, at that point, we also had a similar level of lucidity within us, which made it very easy to find the right way towards midtown, just some twenty blocks away. 
202	2	a	I canÂt even begin to explain the satisfaction of reaching such a fun, bright-looking, spectacular part of New York... mostly because I was unable to process it myself. I was back in sponge-mode, taking in and absorbing all the feelings I could take in and absorb. Visually, it was a really heavy part of the trip - not because of any hallucination, but because the colors were so rich and vibrant that they made the city look alive. Another bit and trace of human soul, of human visibility, and humanity itself. Every single color told me a story, and transmitted a feeling. (I wish I could make more clear associations between colors and moods, but I never wrote any of it down, so IÂm afraid I have forgoTen exactly what ÂvibesÂ I got). 
203	2	a	A highlight of our ocular tour downtown was the enormous and flashing Desigual store. Some animations were being displayed on giant LCD screen panels; nothing fancy, just color blocks flashing and alternating - an epilepticÂs nightmare. The shades were all neon, and all kinds of them appeared, but one particular succession that stayed with me was red-yellow-green, which filled me up with hope and happiness. I guess I do remember one of the associations I made, green = hope. Forever and always. 
204	2	a	When we got close enough to see the actual clothes, I was stupefied. On a central, headless, white plastic mannequin was placed a 60s-cropped dress, embellished by an optical illusion checkered black-and-white print all over it, which seemed to shake at every movement of my pupils. That dress was the staple definition of my old Literature teacherÂs style, and I was sent back in my memories, as a cold tidal wave of old experiences washed over me.
205	2	a	Let me explain, for a second. This teacher, whom weÂll call Ms. Potter, to make life a little bit more interesting and magical, was never particularly fond of me. I have never been famous for my native-language literature abilities, but the exam grade I received, at the end of my two years of IB Program, had definitely proved her wrong and exceeded my every expectation. But it wasnÂt in hatred that I thought of her, no. It was because, one particular afternoon of early 2012, when I was an overweight, fifteen-year-old brunette, as she was explaining the way humans relate to one another, she had advised us, ÂIf you want to learn how, and what, things you say can affect the meaning of whatÂs being understood by those around you, you should study Communications, like I haveÂ. The topic had never particularly intrigued me, but Potter had a very considerable amount of knowledge on a vast array of interesting subjects. Unknowingly, I realized I had followed her footsteps, and I was studying Communications. Me, the now-skinny, eighteen-year-old blonde had demonstrated her that she had misjudged me, and that I did have a lot to offer. I felt complete - almost to the point where I wanted to send her an email when we went back to DiannaÂs. Eventually I smartly decided against it, since my last aTempts at prose were pretty horrifying. 
206	2	a	Dianna, Summer, and I eventually found a deli that was open, and seemingly low-key. I picked up a box of hummus and pita chips, Dianna a croissant and a burrito, and Summer didnÂt get anything, since she claimed Âto have been eating cookies all night longÂ. I knew that wasnÂt true, but I respected her decisions and well-being, so I let her be in harmony with herself. Really, the food and eating it turned out to be the most uneventful part of our commute back through the subway. I noticed that Dianna was studying the jelly texture of her brioche incredibly amusing way: she would squeeze it up in a nut-like shape, and then turn around to me while giggle-whispering, ÂDoesnÂt it remind you of a vagina?Â (which yes, it totally did, by the way). 
207	2	a	Once we were back in the Union Square subway, Dianna paced up her walking and straightened her face with a pensive thought, ÂSometimes I feel like IÂm not doing anything here...Â she wondered out loud. This one hit me, like a slingshot in the back of my brain, and I had a brand-new weapon to argue against her: my eighth realization. 
208	2	a	ÂThat is absolutely not true. YouÂre doing so much, all the time. Even now, youÂre walking, youÂre breathing, youÂre talking, and thinking! ThatÂs a lot, and itÂs all simultaneously. ItÂs amazing how much we can do, without realizing. WeÂre constantly doing something, moving, accomplishing, progressing. We canÂt help but do.Â I definitely wasnÂt that eloquent when I commented, but in a nutshell that was my thinking. This is true, sometimes I still take for granted the amount of things I do - reminding myself that every action, every process, every succession is important, fundamental for my sanity and well-being. 
209	2	a	Despite the fact that mine was a response to DiannaÂs complaint, the person who was most impacted by what I said was Summer. She seemed visibly shocked - her eyes widened, she shook her head, looked over and proceeded to thank me for saying that. I, like a good old snarky asshole, simply smirked and encouraged not to thank me for saying the truth. I liked my newfound wisdom, it built in me solid confidence and strength. 
210	2	a	On our way out of the station, we saw an elderly woman, who wore an all-black outfit consisting of leather pants, a cowboy hat, and cowboy boots. Her straight red hair was up in a tight ponytail. She noticed the giddy looks in our faces, and immediately smiled back, telling us, ÂYou three look beautiful together! For how long have you been friends?Â 
211	2	a	I donÂt know why I felt entitled to answer that question the way I did, I let my soul speak, ÂForeverÂ. I knew that that experience had made Summer and Dianna think the same, so, in their discrete laughter, I sensed newfound comfort in our friendship. I loved how at ease and in- sync we finally were. 
212	2	a	She smiled, small, golden teeth emerging from thin, purple lips, ÂHow long has that been? Seventeen, eighteen years? Nineteen or twenty?Â she asked. Dianna smiled and confirmed, ÂYes, more or less our whole lives!Â 
213	2	a	ÂWell, you do look pretty young! How old are you?Â she asked again, but before Dianna could say a single word, the woman went on, ÂNo, wait! IÂll guess it. Wait!Â I found that woman hilarious; we hadnÂt even moved ever since sheÂd stopped us! She began to close her eyes, rubbing her palms together, and followed by asking Dianna a series of questions regarding her mountainy preferences, to then suggest a series of unlucky guesses, ÂIs it Novembah? Octobah? ItÂs gotta be late-Octobah-early-Novembah!Â her New York accent came through with its full force on the last desperate guesses, ÂNo, not really, IÂm sorry!Â Dianna added. Like it was her fault. 
214	2	a	She, then, moved on to me. One penetrating look, with her almond-shaped, glassy brown eyes, was enough to declare, ÂOh you girl. You girl, LOVE a camera. And the camera loves youÂ. I wonder why she didnÂt even aTempt to guess my birthday, which is what she immediately moved on to try with Summer. I didnÂt catch what she asked, because, as Summer was supposedly beginning to answer back, we felt the cold, aseptically artificial breeze of a new train racing by. ÂOh thatÂs my train. I will see you, girls. Stay friends! Please stay friends!Â, the woman said goodbye to us and ran downstairs, her small legs shaking furiously along with her frantic exposed tongue. 
215	2	a	We leK it unspoken, but all of us felt that was another sign, one that indicated how helplessly weÂd been bounded through this experience. Who that woman was didnÂt matter; the fact that she was terrible at guessing birthdays didnÂt matter; what mattered was the fact that we heard it from another voice: Stay friends! Please stay friends! And we were going to. And we are going to. Besides that, that interaction was just funny - it was just so obviously spiritual that it made me automatically take acid less seriously, as I nonchalantly commented, ÂDamn. That lady was tripping harder than us, guys!Â Dianna smiled and asserted, ÂOh next time, weÂll have some of what sheÂs been playing withÂ. 
216	2	a	By this point, both Dianna and Summer were coming down. Dianna still seemed preTy out of sync with reality, and I could see the cloud of acid-weirdness still dissipating over her mind. Her movements were still a little racy, and she was restless, but didnÂt seem to be too involved with herself anymore. Summer was a little more complicated to figure out, because her accounts of the story differ. In an upcoming part, I will provide evidence to support the fact that she was still pretty high, but throughout the whole trip, and while reviewing her experience in its entirety, she generally claims to have not experienced much, visually at least. IÂm not sure how true this is, but this report focuses on my story, my feelings, and my observations - so I will note my inferences. 
217	2	a	On another note, two half-blotters werenÂt guaranteed to be particularly powerful, no matter how expensive and pure the acid we got, presumably, was. We were looking at about five hours of tripping and two of comedown on first-time users, like Summer and Dianna. I had had a full one, on the other hand, so I was nowhere near being done. Oh no. I was about to explode. 
218	2	a	When we came back, everyone in the suite was asleep. Summer and I sat by the living room, while Dianna was determined to wake up Mark, and test sex on acid. I was beyond thrilled to finally get to my snack - and am happy to report that eating with Lucy makes it even more fun! Even a pre-packaged and uber-processed hummus treat was heavenly, mostly because of the creamy texture. I was fascinated by how the crispy, hard chips mercilessly drowned in the dense sauce, and I moved it around multiple times, just to watch it dissipate. Eventually, I ran out of chips, and proceeded to dip and feel the sonftess of the chickpea-flavored condiment hands on - oh yeah, I used my very own index finger to ravish anything leK in that plastic box. Food was meant to be eaten and enjoyed, and I oughted to appreciate every last bit of it. 
219	2	a	Deciding we werenÂt sleepy just yet, Summer and I turned the lights of the common area back on, and pulled out my laptop, to relax on the web a little bit. I was still convinced we were all coming down, so I visited a website off of my saved Reddit thread of cool links to check out while on LSD. The first one brought us to a remarkably trippy interactive visualizer, made up of retro-pixelated blobs of vanishing colors. As I moved the cursor, the particles of turquoise, bright yellow, and green hues would break apart in tiny red and pink ones, something which totally astounded me. I felt like my brain was melting as I stared at the screen, completely lost in those visuals. I guess that the thought that made me realize I was still feeling the acid was the simple fact that I was being entertained by that one single animation for too long, and a bit too intensely (IÂm usually one of those tab-whoring, three-hundred-miles-per-second, avid multitaskers, and have a hard time focusing on only one webpage, when IÂm at the computer). 
220	2	a	I tried a few songs to accompany the visualizer, but nothing was weird enough. I wanted something fucked up - something so completely uncanny and off-sounding that I could have rejoiced at its peculiarity. Summer gave me a few suggestions, but everything sounded too conventional. ÂNo, I need avant-garde shit!Â I said. And as soon as I did, I knew a record that was uncomfortably smooth enough: Tim BuckleyÂs Lorca. I remembered it because of a particular comment on its Rate Your Music page, along the lines of ÂIÂve heard stranger things before, but this is the one Tim Buckley people will frown at you for playing at a partyÂ, and I really wanted a party of heavy frowns, right then and there. 
221	2	a	We stayed like that for some time - again, I canÂt tell you how long precisely, but it was quite consuming. The blobs on the visualizer began to look like lilttle faces even more than usual - I have extreme pareidolia on any kind of substance: I see faces in everything and everywhere, except for peopleÂs features, where, ironically enough, they should actually belong. All the colors were turning into separated units of light and expressions. It was a kind of ordinarily divine, but I still assumed it was the end. It was very similar to feeling really stoned... nothing too out of normal highs. 
222	2	a	When the album ended, I found myself at a loss of what to do. The visualizer had been entertaining, but IÂd had enough. In the mean time, Summer had been writing haikus and lyrics, which made a lot of poetic sense, and I felt very jealous of her ability to create things that were so beautiful. I shook it off immediately, and invited her to sponge-out with me, ÂHave you ever heard of ODDSAC?Â I asked. 
223	2	a	ÂNope,Â she answered, facing the screen. I smirked, ÂOh youÂre in for a treat. ItÂs this movie made by the members of Animal Collective, a few years ago... itÂs like a visual album. They even screen it here in the city, sometimesÂ. As an avid AnCo fan, I knew about the short film, but IÂd never considered watching it while high. I knew it was weird enough to do the trick though, so we tried it. 
224	2	a	ItÂs not my place to describe, or figure out, what exactly is going on in ODDSAC. ItÂs a glorious mesh of visual, and hypothetical, scenarios that I recommend you check out for yourselves - so I will not spoil the surprise. I think we were about ten or fiKeen minutes in, when a very giggly Dianna and a tired-looking Mark emerged out of the room. For the movie, weÂd turned the lights back off, and their tall shadows announced to us they were going to be taking yet another shower. Summer decided to take a nap, as she felt very sleepy, and I was ready to follow her. 
225	2	a	We lied down in the dark of DiannaÂs room, in her roommateÂs bed. Summer was quick to settle into sleep, but, as soon as the lights were back off, I was in another universe. The springboard darkness gives anyone tripping is formidable, to say the least. When youÂre voided, your brain just works to fill it all back in with visuals. My dose was preTy weak, so thatÂs why I think I was able to maintain my cool for so long, when out in the open. There was no chance I was immersed in complete darkness at any point before that part of the trip, and as I had already noted, closed-eye visuals were much clearer than open-eyed ones in the light. 
226	2	a	It all started with little sparkles of rainbow light, flying around in front of me. I didnÂt realize they were hallucinative in nature, at first. I just thought that it was late, I had been up and running for a long time... this must be some sort of trick my eyesight played on me, after brain had been processing information for a long time, which does happen sometimes. The truth, preTy literally, slapped me in the face approximately ten seconds, when the sparkles began to move... tiny little freckles of multicolored, intangible rain. 
227	2	a	And the more I looked, the more concrete they became. From sparkles, they became hairs, then wires, and then threads. I saw the colors flowing within them, pouring pigment sliding from end on end - it was all extremely hypnotic, I mean, I felt like I probably had this staggered look on my face, as I saw everything flying, and turning, and twisting. It was mesmerizing. 
228	2	a	They kept getting thicker, and thicker, until they turned into little pencils. They broke apart, and turned into classic B orange pencil-shaped rockets, which launched across the room in constant takeoff. As soon as they were in flight, theyÂd disappear, and new ones would form and fly. It was a spectacle, and it made me understand that I had taken acid, and that I was tripping, pretty badly, too. 
229	2	a	My stimulation prompted me to experiment with closing my eyes again, and my lord, am I glad I did it - it was insane. At first, I got the same hazy, dark fractals from before, but they seemed much more detailed. Still hazy, but detailed. They didnÂt stick around for too long, as the mandala I saw broke apart, and turned into a tunnel I was catapulted into. ThatÂs when I got why they call this ÂtrippingÂ. I thought I was in the front row of a roller coaster, which would take me to different sights, and stop at certain locations for a few seconds more. 
230	2	a	One of such stops was a discotheque. Not a club, not a bar, not a venue, but a disco-disco. There were bright magenta lights, and I saw a gorgeous african-american woman dancing. She had long, smooth legs and a sick, huge afro. She definitely didnÂt match my initial expectation of what I imagined Lucy must have looked like, but is now the most concrete envisioning I have of her - she was the acid! 
231	2	a	The roller coaster took me closer to her face, and as she waved her body from leK to right, I saw her big, velvety lips becoming larger, and larger. Then I radically turned leK and saw even more lips. There were lips of all kinds appearing before me: illustrations, animations, the Rocky Horror lips, my friendsÂ lips, the Flaming Lips... just so many mouths smiling and frowning, smirking and crying, through their teeth. Surrealistically majestic splotches of red and pink light bathed the scene with spice and gusto. It was great. 
232	2	a	Then, it all got really dark again. The roller coaster took me to a lot of spooky sights. I saw multiple devils, and interpretations of what the word ÂdemonicÂ meant. I saw pure evil, and all that it embodied, but I wasnÂt affected. All of the skulls and skeletons (which, let me tell you, IÂve been terrified of in the past), and smiling crows, and dolls turning their heads... they just didnÂt affect or scare me, at all. They were just inevitable. It was like, Âoh yeah, thereÂs bad stuff in lifeÂ, but it is part of life itself, so I couldnÂt avoid it. Nor did I want to. I wanted to face my evils, like I knew I was supposed to everyday, in reality. 
233	2	a	At one point, Summer leK to go talk to Dianna and Mark, who were out of the shower, and chatting in the common area. I was too immersed in my trip to care to hang out with others, so I just stayed in the room. I went back to the rocket-pencils and threads of light, which were now all happening at the same time, and it was glorious. They were joining together and spinning in circles, creating rainbow ferris wheels that circled at 3000 miles per second. 
234	2	a	Unfortunately, I, yet again, wasnÂt really paying attention to fact that an outer world existed, so when Dianna stepped in, announcing Summer was going to return to Blue C, I wasnÂt too thrilled. Summer encouraged me to stay and take a nap, but Dianna reiterated how worried she was about the possibility of her walking back by herself. We were just three blocks and half a street away, but I sensed that I was being kicked out. 
235	2	a	ÂYeah, IÂd definitely feel better if you went along with herÂ Dianna said. ÂSure, no problemÂ I responded, wide-eyed. 
236	2	a	I went back to the common area and picked up my boots again. Putting them on wasnÂt exactly challenging, but I definitely made no sense. I was overwhelmed by the reality of objects once more, and everything amazed me, in a way it never had. This state was probably reflected on my face, as Dianna brushed by my shoulders and asked, ÂLen, are you okay?Â 
237	2	a	ÂWa-wa yeah!Â I responded, feeling like a little kid. I am a child, IÂm a lover being born, my mind sang lyrics, and my mouth clipped sounds. I was feeling fried, ÂGirls, I donÂt think IÂm done 
238	2	a	tripping just ye-et!Â I announced excitedly. Dianna and Summer looked down at me with worried looks, and, as Summer helped me up, she spoke the words I could have never, ÂNo, youÂre definitely not.Â 
239	2	a	Summer seemed tired as we made our way downstairs again. My little computer of a mind was trying, more or less helplessly, to process the elevator, the exit, the cooler air outside... but still, nothing made any sense. As soon as we were in Union Square again, I asked Summer how she was feeling: ÂAre you still tripping?Â 
240	2	a	She gave me a smirk, ÂNah, I was done for hours ago!Â 
241	2	a	The fact that she was in a post-trip mindset, and knew I was still way up, made my shield of vulnerability weaker, and I put down my guard to tell her exactly how I felt. I was scared I wasnÂt going to remember it, and would never be able to share it with her again in the future. That moment was all that mattered, and I needed to get emotional immediately, before I would have been European and proud all over again. 
242	2	a	ÂSummer, I... I... I... I just love you so much. YouÂre just so important to me; youÂre like my soulmate, and after this, but, but even before, really, nothing is going to keep us away from each otherÂs lives!Â I addmitted, excited. 
243	2	a	Her eyes lit up, with an acid-enhanced glimmer, ÂOh stop!Â she requested, flattered, ÂIÂm so thankful and happy that youÂre here, and that we did this together... you know what it is? IÂve been trying to find it for a while, and now I know. You bring color, thatÂs what you do in my life, you bring colors,Â IÂm aware this sounds like acid talk, but trust me, for Summer that is the most natural and effortless thing to say. 
244	2	a	She continued, ÂEspecially with your hair all curled up like that, you remind me of Penny Lane from Almost Famous!Â she remarked again. I was just as happy and hugged her tiny self. Wrapping my arms around her, I felt my bulky headphones weighing down my handbag: music. I needed music again! 
245	2	a	After a five-minute long, heartfelt embrace, I excused myself, and plugged in the headphones to my phone - which is my main source of music streaming. I was still way up there, so I conceded myself an artificial, soundtracked, short walk back to Blue C. I decided to play some traditionally acid-y modern music, so that it wouldnÂt have felt en[rely out of place and touch with my times. 
246	2	a	In terms of processing reality, this was the most intense part of my trip. As soon as ÂWhy WonÂt You Make Up Your MindÂ by Tame Impala, began playing, nothing made sense. Nothing made sense on a whole different level, a level so overwhelming and so intense that I just had to accept it, and succumb to my mental impairment. Trying to find an explanation on the most everyday - or, in this case, everynight - elements that I encountered down the street just was too much. 
247	2	a	I immediately recalled seeing one of WestÂs friends, about two weeks earlier, on magic mushrooms. He kept mentioning how reality seemed like Âtoo muchÂ, but I wasnÂt able to understand what he meant by that. Now, I definitely did. The paradoxes and problems with everything seemed all-too clear, and shapes and sizes uniting together made everything even more complicated. 
248	2	a	The intensity of those sensations was so heightened that I had to vocally express it, like when I was back in DiannaÂs room, slamming my fist on her roommateÂs bed. I released my energy by spinning around, twirling down the street, delightfully exhausted. As I saw cars passing, I felt even safer seeing the world continue running, and never stopping. This was my world, and I belonged, and knowing that was all I needed to entice an overwhelming wave of happiness, that, coupled with the phazed-guitar of the song, turned off my mental intelligence completely. I began expressing that sense of comfort with very loud, strange noises. They sounded like moans of pain, the ones we make when weÂre stressed out and need to release stress. I mean, I definitely felt all-too relaxed, if anything, but my brain was so puzzled by what was around me that I couldnÂt help it. I couldnÂt hold it in, ÂMMMMM... AAAAAAAAAH....MMMMM!!!Â
249	2	a	As we reached the market in front of Blue C, and I noticed some workers moving around, carrying grocery stocks in large, metal carts, I smiled at them, and at the blaring lights of the store preparing to open. A new day was dawning, and it was beautiful for me to witness it. Looking back, I guess IÂd recommend acid for people with depression, or whoever feels tired and useless with the world they live in. It is such a revelatory experience for all that we take for granted. Even a store opening up just didnÂt make sense, as a whole: it was all made of small parts - the connection between every single task was what made us able to perform activities. I was never an existentialist, but in that moment, I understood entirely what the philosophy entailed, and it was the truth. 
250	2	a	Acid has changed me in that sense: I canÂt be the nihilistic, life-is-just-a-giant-absurdist-salad thinker I used to be. Sure, I still love Camus and Nietzsche, but I regained so much more belief in human relationships and connections. Especially in terms of how much we all need each other to carry out our lives, and this assigns meaning to our actions and activities - our motivation to deepen the affinities between us, and others. 
251	2	a	When we walked inside Blue C, Summer made sure I had my University ID prepared at the entrance to enter in the building. Yet, yet again, I wasnÂt impaired. Tapping the card and pressing the digits that represented my birthdate wasnÂt difficult, it was natural, it was all that I needed. I remembered my birth, and where I was now, and the recurring thought of how far IÂd come from my Nowhereland made my knees weak with joy. 
252	2	a	Quite literally, seeing as, as soon as we entered, Summer felt the need to sit at the columns that supported the three massive towers of Blue C. It was our courtyard area, and despite the air getting gradually cooler, as fall grew harsher, I wasnÂt bothered by being outside. No, I was glad I was. Summer was sitting in front of me, her knees in her hands, her head resting on the wall. She looked at the cloudy moon we were having that night, and I thought about how her round, pale face was a moon of its own. It was all I could focus on, and as soon as I set my eye-spotlight on it, all the posters and signs that were up started to melt again. My brain rejected anything 
253	2	a	that I wasnÂt intently making the object of my attention, I observed. My reality was too intense and complicated, and I couldnÂt even focus on it anymore. 
254	2	a	Because of my state, Summer offered me to go to up to her suite. I accepted eagerly, seeing as the loK, which I clearly didnÂt belong it, was most definitely not where I had to be. When we stepped in, SummerÂs suite mate, Amaya, was still awake, video chatting with some of her Indian friends. She was originally from Mumbai and oKen missed on sleep to keep in touch. We asked her what time it was, and she replied, ÂItÂs six thirty AM now, I might go to sleep soon!Â. 
255	2	a	For some reason, seeing a new person and a new environment revamped my acid-minded state, to the point that all I could see of Amaya was her radiant beauty. She emanated a sense of well- being and my eyes widened as I stared at how regal she seemed: her tan skin, large brown eyes, and rich black hair made her look like an Indian goddess. I remembered how once, when I was telling her about Seth, she told me that I was Âactually perfect,Â and that I needed to find someone who would appreciate it. In that moment, she was the one who was perfect and beautiful, and I felt like I had to tell her. So I did. 
256	2	a	ÂAmaya, youÂre so beautiful!Â I said, in an unusually high-pitched singsong voice. Just like everyone else, on acid, she had a color, ÂYour color is like an amber orange gold. YouÂre so beautiful!Â I repeated, startled at my sight. As I spoke, I paced back and forth all around the suite. A place that I was so used to seeing seemed so different, and I thought that if I explored it all through I would have regained the familiarity. Amaya, initially amused, looked, to an extent, concerned and said, ÂOh my gosh, youÂre drunk, arenÂt you?Â 
257	2	a	She helped me into her room, ÂSit, sit, youÂre drunk. Sit!Â I wasnÂt surprised she misunderstood what substance I was on, mostly because Amaya doesnÂt really give into the outer-wordly, psychonautic ventures we partake in. She quickly introduced me to her friends on the other end of the globe through her large computer screen, and I waved excitedly, ÂGuys this is Len, she's drunk... sheÂs a little off, but sheÂs fun!Â 
258	2	a	ÂNah, May, I just dropped a tab of acidÂ I remarked nonchalantly. I had never been in AmayaÂs room, so a new place helped me settle down. Immediately as I said, I heard a loud collection of delayed gasps coming from her computer, ÂWHAAAAT!Â her friends exclaimed in unison with her. ÂWhy did you do that?!Â she asked. I smiled calmly and said, ÂI donÂt know, it seemed like a fun time. ItÂs great, reallyÂ I awkwardly responded, looking around all over her small dorm. 
259	2	a	Summer briefly walked in to inform me that she was going to sleep, as she had to take a train to Long Island to see her friend Lola, later in the morning. I decided to follow her, but as soon as I asked her whether I could crash there, since her roommate was absent, I had the horrible sensation she wanted me out of there immediately. I kept insisting I had to leave, and that irritated her to no end. She finally exploded on me and accused me of Âacting like a bitch!Â 
260	2	a	It was just a split second of rage, but it was a kind of rage I had never seen on her soK features. Immediately after the release of her emotions, she apologized, affirming she had been consumed by what had overtaken her. I didnÂt care much of it, since the room was dark and I was distracted by the visual patterns that were forming on her pale face. Her bed, which was positioned way up, was hard for me to reach, so she helped me up, and we sat watching her roommateÂs polka-dot comforter change into a variety of shapes.
261	2	a	They melted and moved downwards, falling into the endless ground, and breaking apart to regenerate again. They were black, and the rest of the baby pink blanket formed a series of tubes that would connect rainbow pipes from dot to dot, sparkling as they moved. The beauty of that vision had me entranced. 
262	2	a	ÂIÂm so glad we listened to West and decided to take the acid instead of the shrooms,Â I said. That prompted Summer to ask me a vaguely unrelated question, ÂWould you ever do West again?Â
263	2	a	I thought about it, but it was hard to come to any sort of long-term conclusion on casual relationships on acid. Deep within me, I knew my relationship (and I donÂt mean romantic) with West was more or less meaningless; it was something I had thought about while I was sober. Yet, on acid, I had no opinions, no desires, no sense of what made sense and what did not, so, I ended up repeating ÂI donÂt knowÂ at least fiKeen times. Yet again, I was a neutral sponge.
264	2	a	That was when my ninth realization washed upon me: everything fluctuates, especially moods and feelings. Nothing had remained the same, and nothing ever would. Life was about bonds being formed and destroyed; people bridging out into our lives and then leaving, often without a physical trace. No single thing ever really stays, it all becomes something anew. From the bed, I looked to my hands, and my chipping nail polish, and I saw beauty in it too. The beauty of breakdown and decay, the beauty of the real end of everything. Not because it revealed my naked nails and prompted a new canvas, rather the decadence itself had a particular fascination about it. I was intrigued by life running its course, tangibly and emotionally. 
265	2	a	I was overtaken by emotion and found myself retreating within, so I leK Summer alone to get her sleep and walked over to the mirror. The last time IÂd seen myself was before weÂd leK for Times Square, so I wanted to check on how my lipstick and wild hair had been doing. It seemed amusing to me how people donÂt recommend looking at their own reflections in the mirror on acid, yet I would have been way unhappier with my appearance if IÂd been sober: my hair had fluffed up significantly, and all that was leK of my dark brown stain was a dry-looking line along the outer edges of my lips. I looked so different than I used to on a daily basis. 
266	2	a	My pupils were almost occupying the entire rim of my iris, and one could barely tell what my eye color was. The more I looked through that thin stroke of hazel-brown, the more I penetrated my soul and saw within me. The trip I took inside myself helped me better articulate my fourth realization, turning into my tenth. My essence, now displaced and unfamiliar, seemed absent from my reflection. I could be without my body, because all I needed was clothes and accessories to define my iconography, as opposed to my soul.
267	2	a	It was an ebbing sight and feeling, to know that my commodities seemed more representative of my persona, rather than my character. I knew what the purpose of my trip had been, right then and there, I needed for my soul to be sole definitive factor of me. I needed to feed my spirituality in order for that to become the only nourishment that mattered. 
268	2	a	I kept breaking through the surface of that mirror: fucked up hair, barely any makeup, no underwear... and I saw the truth beyond me; everything I ever meant and represented, and it had never been any clearer. I was just there, as myself, as the one, true me. And I could only see it through, and because of, acid. 
269	2	a	After that, I was ready to let my mind hallucinate me to sleep. The paTerns that I saw would have been my lullabies, I thought. I went inside AmayaÂs room, in order not to disturb exhausted Summer. She was preparing to sleep too, and, seeing as her roommate Maria wasnÂt there, invited me to crash on her bed. I readily accepted, and watched as she turned off the light. I looked around myself, saying goodbye to my acid-sight, and ready to feel it all falling back into everyday place. 
270	2	a	Obviously, itÂs not like I had tremendous amounts of control over what I perceived, and Amaya did have a night-light, or some derivative that reflected light, and the room wasnÂt pitch black. I was able to see her Suits large poster hanging off the wall: it showed two shadows of tall men wearing suits, both black, blurred out silhouettes, against a purely white background. I saw them melting and morphing in front of me. I felt like I was watching an optical illusion, as they blended and harmonized with such a contrasting, solid, backdrop. 
271	2	a	I kept my eyes open for a few more moments, and as I listened to Close Chorus by A Sunny Day in Glasgow, I saw the threads of light return, and become little nals, that flew around all of us and made me feel peacefully, dizzy. They began to quietly explode, becoming fainter and fainter, until I had to squint to properly see. They were the sleep-inducing fireworks of the night, a perfect way for me to finally close my eyes. At that point, I saw magenta-pink and black fractals, nothing too generic, and always dark... until I lost myself into sleep, consumed by the fantastic trip IÂd had. 
272	2	a	I estimate that I fell asleep about an hour after I arrived at SummerÂs, at 7 AM. Considering we dropped our doses at 8 PM, I was really satisfied with my eleven-hour-long acid ride. Especially if we factor in that it was just one tab, it still gave me a rich, but not-too-intense experience, a great introduction into the world of psychedelics. 
273	2	a	At about 9:30 AM, Maria came back. I donÂt really know much about her, but she seemed nice as she requested me to sleep on the couch, which I was more than happy to do. I had a horrible headache, so I was excited to continue my resting phase. When I got up, I could tell IÂd definitely come down, and there were no more visuals or intense feelings, but the world still didnÂt make much sense. There was something just off about the world, at that moment. 
274	2	a	I actually woke up at 1:30, with a deep desire for a rich brunch. Not really because I was hungry, but the idea of scrambled eggs seemed familiar enough to stimulate a link back from the off- world. I said goodbye to Summer, who lamented being extremely tired and still having to visit her friend in Long Island, and joined Amaya downstairs to get a meal in me. I am not going to lie: I was [red. I was exhausted. I could barely process what the next day was going to involve. 
275	2	a	I was definitely down by that point, but I still struggled in processing everyday furniture. I donÂt know why objects were so tough on me, but they just looked complex. As we prepared to head to the cafeteria, we passed by the courtyard which had circular tables and benches all connected to each other, and those still seemed weird to me: why; what does this mean? What does it represent? It doesnÂt make sense, I concluded. 
276	2	a	Eating was peaceful enough, and as Amaya met up with some other Indian friends, I leK to go back to my loK and do a reading. Concentrating without falling asleep was hard, and at one point I saw the words wave and dance around a bit, but it was all tiredness and brain chemistry feedback from LSD. I decided to pick myself up and have dinner with Remy, as we were supposed to exchange psychedelic stories. It was raining faintly across the sky, and it was that rain that represented my spiritual growth. 
277	2	a	As IÂve mentioned, IÂm very sensitive about my hair. Not only was I rocking my wavy locks, but I noticed the raindrops were soaking me - and I didnÂt care. Their delicate texture reminded me of the threads of light, and as my phone screen got wet too, I saw the drops becoming rainbow- colored on the screen, a totally regular, everyday thing. Yet, to me, it became something more. A flashback to my unforgettable experience: it made me want to cry; it reminded me of happiness, and belonging within the universe as a part of the human population. 
278	2	a	Now, whenever I think about being on acid, my heart thumps and drops a little bit, as I struggle to remember what feeling all of that love was like. I want to learn how to love more, and hate less; how to incorporate this richer knowledge and peace into my life. Now, whenever I think about being on acid, my heart thumps and drops a little bit, as I struggle to remember what feeling all of that love was like. I want to learn how to love more, and hate less; how to incorporate this richer knowledge and peace into my life. It was a life-changing first, and definitely not last, experience with LSD.

281	2	a	This experience happened to me about a year ago, March of 2017. I was young and stupid, and I had been experimenting with lots of different drugs at the time. This was the third time I had ever consumed LSD, and very stupidly so I did it in a park in broad daylight. 
282	2	a	I had managed to pick up about two 100ug tabs off of a very nice dealer that I used to know (he's dropped out of the business unfortunately), and I intended to drop them in the middle of a park, ride it out and go home later that night. My reasoning for doing this at a park was because I couldn't really afford to drop it with my parents in the house (again). I still to this day have no idea why I couldn't have just waited for a better set and setting, and do it with a friend that I trust. I have ADHD, so my naturally impulsive behaviour may play a role in my quite frankly stupid decision making at the time. 
283	2	a	So I popped the two tabs under my tongue, did the usual 'if it's bitter it's a spitter' routine. No taste, seemed to check out fine. I managed to find a nice quiet spot in the middle of a park to relax, and just have a good time. I waited in anticipation for the acid to kick in (Roughly 40-45 minutes for me). It was a really sunny day, the birds were singing their songs and I generally just felt quite pleasant. 
284	2	a	So the first thing I noticed was that the clouds in the sky started to morph, and I managed to interpret some cartoonish faces. After the LSD had entered my system the effects were quite acute and sudden in terms of onset. I managed to sit up and observe my surroundings in the park. The ground seemed to move in waves like an ocean, with the grass changing into a multitude of different colours and patterns. It was like I was in an ocean of pure bliss. The sky and ground seemed to move as one, sort of like a conjoined entity. I saw a couple walking in the distance, and felt like I could connect to them both emotionally and experience the love that they have for each other. Now at this point, I realised what I had gotten myself into. This was getting pretty intense for me, due to the fact that my sense of reality had already started to distort. I managed to find a tree nearby, and sort of telepathically connected to it. Asking it for guidance without words (in a way). Now, this tree seemed to tell me that I needed to go home and sit this out in my bedroom (Which to be honest seemed to be quite a sensible idea, tripping balls in a public space like that could have gotten me in serious danger). Rather than make me panic, I managed to retain myself and wandered to the entrance of the park. At this point everything was warping around me and it's probably a miracle that I managed to make it home unscathed. The concrete below me was 'breathing', and I sort of felt interconnected with everything. I stumbled onto a bus and hitched a ride home. 
285	2	a	I instantly ran into my room as soon as I got home, stripped myself down naked and just completely lost control of my body. I collapsed into my bed, and proceeded to melt into my bedroom. I felt this sort of spiritual energy flowing through my room and me (almost a bit like the force in star wars), and essentially let go of my consciousness and let it fly away from my body on this 'wave', like an ocean current. I had some sort of higher being connect to me telepathically again, but this time it seemed to tell me the language of the universe. It made me see and understand how the world works, and that all of my worries and regrets were complete bullshit. It taught me that the world and all of the crap that comes with it is merely a social construct. When it comes down to primal instincts, none of it matters. It transported me through a galaxy of wordless philosophies. Things like this are only explainable when one actually takes the substance. 
286	2	a	Towards the end of my trip, my mother walked into my room to find me without anything on, tripping balls and seemingly unconscious. She called my father and a paramedic, fortunately I was coming out of my journey at this time. When I came to my senses, I had never felt more ashamed of myself, at how stupid I was. How could I disappoint my mother like that? Nevertheless, it wasn't a bad trip at all. It's just the disappointment I experienced afterwards.

289	2	a	After doing shrooms, and ecstasy numerous times I had been wanting something more intense, something that would change my whole aspect on life. I remembered my dads stories about lsd and when he was my age, and thought to myself I need to try it.
290	2	a	I asked around for months for this substant and know one had any idea where to get some. Until this one day one of my friends told me he had just took some the weekend before that was named Sunshine Acid.  My heart instantly started racing when I heard that. That day after school, we went to the dealers house and finally got a hold of it.
291	2	a	Me and another friend took our doses that coming weekend at about 6 o'clock at night, and headed downtown on our skateboards to the skatepark.
292	2	a	One and a half hours of skating had gone by and we had hardly felt anything, so we started thinking it was bunk.
293	2	a	Another half an hour had went by, and I could feel a weird , but good body high come on to me. I looked at my friend and told him we better start heading out....
294	2	a	We were walking by the park which had alot of trees, almost like a forest. The trees started reaching over us on the road and the grass on the ground started turning bright colors. This was still the begining
295	2	a	After another hour of skating town, not knowing where to go, we realized we were way to high to skate, so we decided to head to a friends. When we showed up there, there was loud music being played, Tool I recall. When I got inside the peak hit me. I was zoned out to the walls mealting down to the floor too faces coming out of the wall.
296	2	a	Zoned out to the walls for about a half an hour, I told someone to plug in a movie. They put in chronicals of narnia(crazy on lsd). I had never seen that movie before, and the only thing I remember from it was wolves coming out of no where, and they freaked the shit out of me. After an half an hour of that we decided to get a ride home.
297	2	a	It was now about 10pm, and we were still peaking, heading home in a car. They dropped us off a block from my house, and made us walk in the dark.  I remember walking up the street and seeing big cracks in the ground, and orange stuff coming out of the cracks, almost like lava. The trees around us were spiraling up high in the ski, and were white with little color on it. Everything had seemed so detailed. Finally we had arrived in my house.....
298	2	a	I instantly layed in my bed with the lights off and just zoned out. In my head I could see shapes and patterns changing color, and I kept hearing car horns, and other strange sounds. I had then thought I had lost my mind completly. I kept telling myself that I had lost my mind.
299	2	a	After being scared for about an hour my friend asked me if I wanted to play some video games. I usually didnt like video games until I decided to try it out on acid. This calmed me down way more. That and the weed. 
300	2	a	We played games until we seen light out side, and decided to go to bed before my mom woke up to go to work.  We sat in the room trying to go to sleep but it just wouldnt work. I'm always moving your body around. We ended up pulling and all nighter not getting any sleep.

302	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), First Times (2), Various (28)
303	2	a	First of all I've been in love with this substance the first time I tried it about a year ago its absolutely incredible...
304	2	a	This was my second time to trip on lsd... I took two hits with a girl I dont kno and with sum friends that were rolling(x)...we were at my friend M's house which is where every1 usually goes to trip...
305	2	a	So my trip kicked in and I was lovin it of course and my friend M had one of those electric light things when you touch it the electricity moves with ur finger and is all in different colors and some go with the music ur listening to...well me and this girl became absolutely mesmerized in the beauty of this thing and played with it for around an hour or more and watched the lights dance and follow our fingers and we also saw dancing men dancing around the world in it...
306	2	a	After a while of playing with the light I thought of something to do which was start a bonfire outside in M's backyard, M was like hell yea lets do it but I dont have any wood. So we ended up using this wooden dresser that no one used and me and him had to carry it down the stairs outside and got the other girl that was trippin with me (I'll just call her shelly), we got outside and we were still mesmerized with the beauty of everything and we left mark to set up the bonfire while me and her stood and stared at the grass for about an hour and a half...the grass was like a whole new spiraling world of mysterious beauty it was wonderful...
307	2	a	About maybe 4 hours into the trip me and shelly walked back inside to see the 2 ppl rolling sittin in the kitchen me and shelly walked in there for sum reason which I cant recall and I'm sure we forgot anyway but we looked at each other in the eye and started talkin to each other through our MINDS! It was telepathy and we were like holy shit can u hear me and she was like yea I'm hearin u and I was like this is insane!! And she was like omg this is craaazy but this was all said in our heads and the two ppl rolling were looking at us like wut the fuck?! (me and shelly were talkin back and forth with our minds but also using lots of hand gestures and just looking at each other)
308	2	a	Me and shelly continued to stare each other in the eye and read each others minds, our eyes and minds were completely connected it was so weird I dont know how to explain it and when our eyes were connected all we saw were each others warped faces, our faces would stay where they were and I watched her body float up and dance in the air with her head still as it should be...it kinda reminded me of one of those cat clocks, where the cats head stays still but its body ticks
309	2	a	I was sick of being inside I had such a yearning for the outdoors so everyone else stayed inside and I went outside and sat at a table by myself and watched a tree/bush across his yard for a while....the bush started swirling into infinityand it changed into a dragon swirling a few times it was wonderfully beautiful, but after about 1:30 or so I went back inside to socialize...
310	2	a	It was early in the morning and I was starting to come down now, but patterns and colors were still swirling and making their way in my field of vision.
311	2	a	All in all every trip I've had has been wonderful I dont think theres a better drug out there, LSD is magical and purely spiritual...I feel so at home and at place in the world and pretty much all knowing (or at least I do)... LSD is beautiful and should be treated with respect...theres nothing better or a more incredible feeling than being on it... Me and my friends have never had any bad trips by keeping open minds and stay happy, no worries, and wel have the most beautiful, amazing, enlightening experience ever!!!

313	2	a	LSD (2) : Relationships (44), Glowing Experiences (4), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
314	2	a	I was at a party with my friends and we were waiting on E, which eventually never came around, so our buddy offered us acid for $10 a hit. I took my first hit around 9:45pm that night. At around 10:45 I barely felt anything, but had extreme euphoria.
315	2	a	By about 11:00pm, me and my friend 'Jack' decided to take a walk up to the goat farm up the road. We always went up there drunk looking to kill a goat. I took my second hit when we got up there. I got up to a goat and just started to pet it as I looked at 'Jack' and said 'Do I punch it?' We both decided it didn't seem right to do so. About that time we heard a loud crash that started echoing in my head and ran.
316	2	a	Back at the party around midnight we went on the roof and played with the shapes of the clouds. The visuals made it possible to separate them in the sky with my fingers. Back in the house I saw ÂJacksÂ girlfriend walking around like a ghost. The tracers got really intense from then on.
317	2	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
318	2	a	Around 2:00am, me, ÂJackÂ, and ÂMarkÂ decided to go to our friend 'Mary's' house. We drove up the road as it swerved left and right. It was coming at me in all different directions. We got on the highway and all the lights were neon streaks. A Maryland State Trooper drove by us so we decided to go left into a parking lot to get away, even though he already drove by. It seemed like a good idea at the time. So for about 20 minutes ÂJackÂ and ÂMarkÂ are trying to direct me out of the parking lot as weÂre just going in circles. Eventually we exited after nearly going into oncoming traffic.
319	2	a	When we finally got to ÂMaryÂsÂ neighborhood it was like driving in fairy tale land. All white houses with white picket fences. We pulled into a long driveway and kind of got lost there. We went back and forth. When I realized I was tripping out too hard to back up, we looked for a place in this driveway to turn around. Mind you itÂs past 2:30am in some neighborhood we barely know. We thought there was a field to the right I could turn my truck into, but it looked like it dropped off into a cliff. When neither of them would get out to check, I put on the brake and went and petted the grass to make sure it was level. It was, so I proceeded to go through and turn around.
320	2	a	When we left the neighborhood we went to DennyÂs where all our friends were. Only 4 of us went in, and thatÂs where I really started to trip. I sat at the marble table as it seemed to smear and fold all over itself. The hairs on my arm started waving like I was under water. When I decided IÂm tripping to hard, I just walked out freaking out hardcore but maintained to keep my cool. When I attempted to drive back to the house with ÂMarkÂ, I stalled the truck out twice. Driving an automatic would have been the more logical thing to do.
321	2	a	When we got back, I took another hit and the rest is history. My mind was pretty gone. I donÂt know how I was able to walk around at that point. I vaguely remember chewing on my shirt and beating a drum along with staring at myself in the mirror for over and hour because of how crazy my face was changing. My shadows made me look like Jesus and I smoked over 2packs of cigarettes in less than 6 hours. I tripped for a good 14hours.
322	2	a	I recommend tripping if youÂre NOT DRIVING. Granted it was the most fun thing IÂve ever done in my life, it was probably also the dumbest. I really SHOULD have died with my friends. DO NOT DRIVE.

324	2	a	Before this I took LSD about 5 times, starting with a microdose, gradually up to 240 ug. 
325	2	a	My friend N. Pick me up and I took 3 tabs of Kali Yuga x 110 ug, claimed by vendor at 99% purity, made from the swiss bliss crystal.
326	2	a	T+20 min: I felt that it is going to be the deepest trip in my life. 
327	2	a	T+40 min: I was sitting in a car while girls were shopping. The gray fence in my right was dancing like a snake and was my last connection with reality.
328	2	a	T+1 hour: somewhere from a distance I observed our company arriving to a wonderful loft apartment in the middle of the city. N. asked me to take a bag from his car, but I stared into eternity in response.
329	2	a	T+1:30: I remember lying on the couch, as usual, and N. tried to set up music.
330	2	a	T+2 hours: immediately after that I saw him lying on the floor and screaming with a smile: HOW DID WE GET HERE? WHO AM I? as his wife was nearby and calming him down. Then he stood up and asked: How do you like this, guys?
331	2	a	*** there was me, N. And his wife, Also we were expecting D. and his wife S. was already with us. ***
332	2	a	Somewhere at that time I was completely sure that I was dead, I was observing N. having the best time in his life as S. asked me - is this okay? I told her that N. is god now. Then I told all them that I almost could not see them because I was seeing only fractals and eternity. There was no understanding of time, who I was, what was my name and if I was doing something in my life. I understood that there was no point in any fear, even of death, because even if I die, I will be reborn and I will meet exactly these souls in their mortal shells, and we will get whacked as usual. And this already happened countless times. This was the moment I realised that at 330ug we really need sitters, but there was no fear. Fear was pointless. 
333	2	a	I saw future and past, I was a god. I was beyond particles, I was energy. Then we all danced in joy, drawn with crayons and listened to our favourite music. Our bodies also needed to eat and to drink. Of course we also smoked weed and drank wine. We were dressed in comfortable clothes, we were shamans.
334	2	a	When D. Finally arrived, he was running to join us, shrefding his suit and jumping into sweatpants as I was crying from happiness that he finally arrived. Than N. waited until D. was hit by LSD and told him:
335	2	a	'D. Remember your worst childhood nightmares and face them' to which D. responded: 'There are none, I am god.' Then we ate pizza and ice cream. 
336	2	a	All this looped for eternity as we explored the apartment, revealing new rooms and activities. I was thinking that I wanted my girlfriend to be here with us, but she was not ready yet. I also realised that I love seeing people so happy and I was willing to break law and morals to see people happy. Their tears of joy shined upon my mortal body and cleansed my soul.
337	2	a	Next day 11 in the morning (now tripping almost 20 hours)
338	2	a	I have not slept all this time as sleep was meaningless. When my body felt tired, I just had to shift my attention to my hand that was drawing tantric symbols, as I was trying to compose my personality in silence. N. took his car home, as he then told - he was driving completely safe, his body was just going home automatically. 
339	2	a	About 16:00 next day I came home, threw my clothes on the floor, turned on video of guided meditation by Alan Watts and went into a meditation that lasted until 22:00. Then I ate some rice, checked my email and went to sleep, smiling at my future and being so intrigued of what will happen after I die. I knew that the best part is ahead.

342	2	a	I made up my mindset before this trip by no one ever could have ever ready me for what I was to experience in the journey ahead. I took 2 blots with my friend who is 2 years younger than me. He took half a blot as it was his first time. My school friends A and F stopped by my home just after I took the blots. I told them to not to give any bad thoughts beforehand. 
343	2	a	At about 7.45 pm I felt the acid kicking in. That surge of LSD through my brain rendered me anxious and excited. I started smiling uncontrollably. 
344	2	a	At about 8.10 pm my friends  left my place and me and R were sitting down in front of my laptop listening to music. The visuals had already begun to take hold. I couldn't place my thoughts in an ordered way so I let myself roam. After about some time, R was taking about this new feeling he was getting that he never felt before. I wanted to guide him properly but I couldn't properly shape the words as per I wanted. We were looking at my abstract wall painting. It has wavy shaped strokes in a ocean blue color. We discussed what we saw in that pattern and turns out we saw the same things, many women were embracing themselves in a protective way. I was baffled by the pattern conditioning pattern and suggestive power of our heads when on self drive. After enjoying the visuals, we decided to go to his place as he had good quality speakers at his place. So we displaced from my place to his.
345	2	a	I had been having temporal alterations at this point. We reached his place and we put on some music. I let him decide the songs as I was still trying to get back control of my mind. After some time, one hour or two, I was starting to get back behind the wheel... the best time in the acid trip. It's when I am still tripping but I can control the trip what so ever. We ate something and talked. 
346	2	a	The one thing that hit me very hard was when he told me 'we are all one, and we are all connected'. I realized this thing by my second LSD trip but he got that in the first. I was really proud of him, and I think I guided his trip successfully while tripping myself, The Tripping Trip Sitter. Anyway we talked about life in general, pondered a little about life and death, what lies beyond this realm. We made up a theory about how people get crazy or deemed crazy. It's like there is an astral plane we can't see, but some people due to some inbuilt reasons or drugs, get into this bad negative or the shattered plane and their brains can't process this much 'disinformation', so they are permanently stuck in this plane and cannot get back to the reality plane. This makes them to be deemed crazy and they live through this living plane while their head is still stuck at that plane.  Another theory I thought about is there might be a higher intelligent being who formed us and made us experience this consciousness, and what makes us humans human, is something that also made us so that we cannot comprehend what lies in that plane that the being exists. And we humans are coded in such a way that there are this 'bugs' in our codes, and those 'bugs' are the things that makes us human, i.e, unique in different ways. But yet we are all the same and have the same form of energy.
347	2	a	In this search for closure and knowledge, I hope I can at least get near to that higher consciousness. I hope my thirst for knowledge doesn't drive me crazy because my journey has only begun. I hope my thirst for knowledge doesn't drive me crazy because my journey has only begun. There are so many things to experience yet, so many things. This ego of our keeps us drifting through this ordered chaos in the same aforementioned way. Stay hungry Stay happy.
348	2	a	Now, this is about 11pm. This was when things took an unexpected turn. My mom had come from work. I came back from work and I was more talkative than usual. Finally while we were having dinner my mom knew something was not usual. I was also sweating. I revealed that I had taken LSD, and parents being parents, that too my mom being a doctor having an orthodox view about these substances and drugs, lost her cool. She became chaotic and we had our infamous 'fight'. I tried my level best to make her explain that I know what I am doing and I didn't take drugs without doing the prior research. But it was in vain. I also cried thinking about death and how it is approaching my grandparents. But finally I calmed her down and she went to sleep. 
349	2	a	I couldn't sleep so I drifted through my thoughts and wandered. In the morning I got myself ready and went to our hospital's new unit's inauguration. I was in an impatient state and to go out in the real normal life while not being so normal, it's hard to keep level-headed. But somehow I made through it. It was ironic that I was on drugs, and I went to a hospital. But finally, somehow, after what seemed like ages I was back home, and I went off to sleep. When I got up I was still my extra conscious, but I was back to normal self, the old patterns and habits started taking hold. Yet in a certain way, every time I trip on LSD, I change parts of myself in a good way. But we have to be really careful with substances like this, as there is only a fine line between the vast unexplored planes of the consciousness. My next trip will be after a long time. Peace to everyone out there and keep spreading knowledge and information.

351	2	a	I am a 21 year old female with very little drug experience. I've smoked pot and hash for 5 years now, and just recently started introducing Shrooms and Acid. This experience is about the second time I had acid, the first time was really not so intense or worth documenting on here, and the second is still fresh in my memory.
352	2	a	The evening began with the intentions to do shrooms and go to an all night drive in with one of my best friends K. K had called her dealer and realized he could only get LSD, so I we decided to get it anyway and see where it took us. We bought 2 hits of Acid and went back to her house with some pot, the film Waking Life, and my paints and canvases. We couldn't make it to the movie so we were having a night in. I took half of my hit at 9:30 and listened to some music, waiting for our other friend to show up. He had a car and was not on anything and wanted to go in to the city to get fast food. We listened to music and waiting for our friend S to show up. It was 10:30 when I took the other hit, and just kind of forgot about it as we went for the drive in to BK.
353	2	a	Like the first time on Acid, everything was positive up until this point. We were laughing about everything and I remember having such a warm fuzzy feeling all over. My face actually hurt from smiling so much. I did start to come down slightly when our friend dropped us off, as we realized it was 1am and we were alone on Acid in her room. We had paints and the movie to distract us. For about 2 hours we played around with the paint and watched the film which was mind blowing, I've seen it many times but never on Acid. 
354	2	a	The reason I am actually writing this experience comes down to the point where my friend fell asleep and I was left there to fall asleep. It was 3am and I was probably at my peak. I tend to worry a lot and have been on meds previously  (I went off paxil 2 years ago) for depression and anxiety. I am a lesbian and have not come out to my parents so I lots of emotional baggage, which I was quite aware could end in a disaster for my trip. The exact opposite of a disaster is what I experienced. I rehearsed what I was going to tell my parents, I worked out problems with my love life, I consoled myself and actually formed some self esteem. I felt like I was someone else viewing my life and reassessing it, I realized that so many problems I thought were so bad actually were quite fixable and small. I cried, I even threw up and saw eyes in my puke. The visuals I had were amazing, I stayed and layed in my friends spare bed from 3am to 9am when a repair man came to fix her water tank, where I fell asleep to the sound of him banging away at metal. I didn't want to fall asleep knowing he was going to show up early, but as soon as he did I was actually soothed by the loud noises. My friend woke up at 11am and had an intense headache which lasted far in to the evening. I think it probably had to do with the fact that she didn't have the brain activity that I did, I'm sure if my brain tried to sleep as it was so fucked up I would have had  a headache too.
355	2	a	I know I will only take half next time I do it, as the visual and nausea was not very pleasureable. I did like the therapeautic affect the LSD had on my mind, It really helped me throught my problems. I know that it is dangerous to use drugs when mentally unstable but sometimes it helps you see your life in a different perspective.

357	2	a	This happened in 2015 on a beautiful day in November (it's 2018 now). I live in a place far up north, so there was plenty of snow. Prior to this I had tripped on LSD once, taken MDMA once and I smoked weed regularly. The one LSD trip I had under my belt had been really frightening and I thought I was going to die, so I was nervous as fuck when the day of my second trip finally arrived. The guy I was going to trip with was a friend that I became friends with at the school we were attending, a school where you sleep, eat food and play music all day for a year. We were both 19 at the time. My friend, who we are going to call V, had tripped on acid twice before and had the best time of his life both times.
358	2	a	So to the day of the trip. It was a sunday morning and I woke up at 9 a.m. and went to have some breakfast. I made myself a huge plate, thinking I wasnÂt going to eat for the next 10 hours or so. I tried to keep myself calm, but I couldnÂt get rid of the thought that I was going to have a bad trip, like last time. I sat down beside VÂs roommate, too nervous to even say hello. After a while I blurted out Âa beautiful day, huh?Â. VÂs roommate looked at me and said Âwhy the fuck do you care, are you going fucking skiing or something?Â He had no idea.
359	2	a	After eating I went down to my room and texted V, asking where the hell he was. He said he was almost ready, and would meet me at my room in 10 minutes. That was the worst 10 minutes IÂve had in a while. I thought i was going to have a panic attack. And I was sure as shit that there was no way I wasnt going to have a nightmare trip thinking this way. V finally showed up. He didnt give a fuck about breakfast so we went outside right away. As we were walking to the little forest where we were going to drop the blotters, V managed to calm me down a little bit. He also mentioned that his roommate had autism. We found a sweet spot, and V  took out the blotters, handed me one, and I put it under my tongue. The dosage was 150 micrograms. The nervousness came back and once again i thought I was going to have a bad trip. V asked if we should smoke a joint. I declined at first, thinking that that was the cause of my first bad trip. But he lighted it anyway, and I took a few hits. This turned out to be a great decision! After just a few minutes my nervousness faded away, and I was calm again.
360	2	a	After about 30 minutes we decided to go buy a pack of cigarettes. I started to feel the acid creep up on me. After walking for about 10 minutes we turn around a house, and BAM: we see the ocean. It was really beautiful. There was a few pine trees there too, and the way the sun was shining through made it all look like a scene from a movie. I giggled and said to V ÂI think I'm feeling the acidÂ. Then we stood there for a little while, laughing like idiots. 
361	2	a	We arrive at the gas station. I remember it was a funny feeling coming inside. It sort of made the trip more intense. We stood inside for a while, not knowing what to do exactly. We started laughing again, and I began to wonder how fucked up we looked. I suddenly remembered why we were here, so I went up to the desk and said Âgive me a pack of cigarettesÂ. For some reason this was hilarious to me, and I really tried hard not to laugh my ass off. I got the cigarettes and payed, and we walked outside. I felt a little embarassed.
362	2	a	On the way back we walked over a bridge, with a river from the ocean running below. We stopped and my jaw dropped. Some of the river was frozen, and it looked like the ice was moving. As I stared at the ice I could se stars and planets, and it looked beautiful, like the universe. I explained to V what i saw, and he agreed completely. I also stated Âtheres no way in hell that ice isnt moving!Â. Of course it didnÂt.
363	2	a	We went back to the school, and I decided to have a shower in my room. This is were the acid peaked. As I was standing in the shower I started to see some weird shit on the shower curtain. I saw a beaver, standing on his hind legs with a crown on his head. I found out he was a king, and that his army was going to war against an evil lion. It was like seeing a movie. Suddenly I came back to myself again, and thought to myself that I was really tripping. I tried to focus on the shower curtain again, and this time I felt like I was in a space ship. I had the feeling that I was racing through space with an enormous speed. It started to feel a little too real, and at one point I thought I saw some aliens behind the shower curtain. I became scared and turned off the shower and layed in bed for a while.
364	2	a	I began watching a movie, but it seemed so fake to me. The only thing I could think of were how much the actors humiliated themself playing such stupid characters in such stupid movies. And how our society glorifies and look up to these clowns. IÂve never watched a movie in the same way since.
365	2	a	It was about 5 hours since we took the LSD when V texted me, asking if I wanted to jam. I said yes, so we went over to the building with all the rehearsal rooms. I play guitar, and V got behind the drums and started laying down this really groovy beat. I felt like I was playing like a god, and that we had an almost telepathic connection: every time I began playing a different melody or riff, V got the mood I was going for immediately. I felt like Santana at woodstock, that the guitar was a snake I had to tame. I could really feel the music, and one time we both started playing slower and slower, feeling like time became warped and we entered a different dimension where time didnÂt go as fast as here on earth. 
366	2	a	After jamming for about an hour, the effects of the LSD really started to diminish. It didnÂt happen much more worth writing. During the trip, there were times I felt safe and comfortable, and other times I felt really fragile and scared. But at the end I really felt like I had accomplished something, that I hadnÂt let the fear win. So all in all a good experience, which we repeated a few times, and eventually got kicked out of the school, but thats another story! Hope you enjoyed the read, and stay safe!

368	2	a	LSD (2) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
369	2	a	Last summer, I was 20 years old. My friend and I road-tripped a week down to my other friend, who got us the acid. The three of us dropped together, and kept up such a strong positive vibe the whole time. Since then, I listen to music better. I 'get' it now. Music is the purest expression of the existence each of us manifests, and I had to take LSD to realize how to enjoy that.
370	2	a	It was almost surprising how stereotypical the effects are. Bright kaleidoscopes and sense of oneness. But this really is just the way.

373	2	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
374	2	a	"It was a beautiful day and G, R and I had just bought a strip of ÂDragon Ball ZÂ acid the previous day. We called it this because or plug only sold LSD on sheets with the DBZ logo. Due to the weather, we decided it would be a perfect day to drop and we each took one tab of 200ug strength. We then drove around the city and pulled endless gbÂs as we waited for the acid to kick in, (donÂt drive on acid we are stupid). At about 30mins in I began to feel the familiar warm euphoric glow and I knew I was in for a great trip. Another 30mins had passed and we headed back to G & RÂs apartment as it was really starting to kick in for G and R but for me the warmth and euphoria had only grown stronger and I had yet to experience and visual. This was odd as I usually begin to experience visuals early on into the trip.	Overall 2hrs had passes since I had first dropped the feeling of warmth and euphoria was still steadily building and had become so intense that it was almost overwhelming."
375	2	a	"Then suddenly while lying on a couch in the living room I felt a ÂpopÂ and it was as if reality went through a paper shredder and those strips of reality were sucked away into the top right of my vision. Those strips were replaced with complete blackness that eventually gave way to a mystical ÂdimensionÂ void of space and time. While I was there I lost everything that I had always perceived as ÂmeÂ all I was reduced to pure tranquility and I can vaguely remember vibrant reds, yellows, oranges, and purples. I donÂt remember much about this place other than this. IÂm not sure how long I was gone but while I was there it felt like eternity. I returned to ÂrealityÂ with a wide grin, G and R asked me what happened and it took me a while to gather my thoughts all I could do was just smile and laugh like and insane man. I eventually gathered my thoughts and told them what had happened. They didnÂt seem to believe me as they had never experienced anything similar on acid. I believe this to be my first ego death experience. 	"
376	2	a	After I was able to collect myself I walked over to the mirror in the room and stared at myself for a while. At this point I was tripping sack and was curious what would happen. At first I looked normal, slowly, my skin became pale, eventually grey, my eyes turned a deep black, and my hair was moving as if it was alive. This startled me at first as I was not expecting to morph into a foreign being, but although eerie the being standing before me did not appear to be menacing. Since this first experience I have continually perceived myself as an ÂalienÂ looking entity. As the acid began to slowly ware of I saw fractals of lessening intricacy and vividness as I eventually returned to baseline, and was greeted the next day by a lovely afterglow. Sadly, I have yet to experience anything like this since though, I have tried to return on multiple occasions but to no avail.

379	2	a	I dont know why I am posting this, I really feel I have no need to, but at the same time I also feel as if the experience I had must be shared.
380	2	a	I am a semi experienced LSD user, I have done it multiple times, and  it has always been a very enlightening experience.  This time was different, It was not a bad trip, but what I felt was that I had somehow come to an understanding of the world, and that the understanding had somehow slipped away. I dont know how to explain it, so i'll just go over the night.
381	2	a	I took 3 hits of liquid acid on the toungue at about 930PM.  We drove back to my friends house and went inside and began to listen to music and hang out.  I had not spent much time with these people, they were new friends, but they were very nice and they all made me feel very comfortable.  
382	2	a	I began to feel the initial effect about an hour after injesting.   
383	2	a	The sence of anxiety, of knowing whats going to happen.  About 2 hour into the trip, I began to get some very detailed and fascinating open eye visuals, I went into my friends bathroom, and stared at his shower wall, I felt like I was swimming in the sea, no sailing the sea, the acid ship was at my control.
384	2	a	Later we went over to another friends house and I sat and played video games for quite a while, I was really enjoying myself, everything was funny as hell and the video game, super mario cart for gamecube was trippy as fuck.
385	2	a	At about 5 Oclock AM, the effects were still very stong,  but something began to become strange.  I was the only one awake at this point, and I was now just sitting and staring into space and thinking.  And thses thoughts kept coming into my head. As I looked around the room, I see all these people, just passed out from a night of doing drugs and partying, and I looked at myself, and I felt this overwhelming sadness, I felt like nothing more that a junkie, a knew that thats all I was, all I am.  
386	2	a	I went outside, and started at the city and the now lightening sky, and thought about how insignificant I really am in the whole perspective of the world, and an overwhelming sadness came over me.  I then knew that I needed to do something, that I needed to change my life around.
387	2	a	I would have to say that LSD has helped me realize things about myself. The unfortunate thing is that I wish I had realized more, I feel like I missed something big.
388	2	a	LSD is a powerful drug, used wisely, it can do a great deal of good, but it can also be a monster, and destroy.

390	2	a	I used to do acid whenever I could get my hands on it in high school.  (Generally every weekend).  I loved it and always had a great time for about the first 2 years of doing it.  I never really had strong visuals, but would come to meaningful conclusions about the world and have powerful realizations.  I also enjoyed laughing my ass off at the insanity of the human race.  After a while something changed though.  I began to have bad trip after bad trip.  I would get paranoid and had trouble trusting the people I was with.  I thought that they were laughing at me and staring at me, wondering what was wrong with me.  I also developed anxiety problems.  I'm not sure what changed but I can no longer handle acid anymore and I'm kind of sad about that, but well, there's always mushrooms.

392	2	a	LSD (2) : Not Applicable (38), Addiction & Habituation (10), Bad Trips (6), Retrospective / Summary (11), General (1)
393	2	a	I had done LSD four times before this trip, but the most I had ever taken was two tabs. I had some money and a urge to have a huge trip with one of my best friends, so I bought six tabs. My guy said they were really potent and to be careful with them. I ended up taking three and my friend who had never done acid took one. About an hour and a half later I started feeling really fried and started seeing some of the strongest visuals I have ever felt.
394	2	a	We were at my friend's house smoking some weed when my little brother called me at around 8:00 PM. He sounded worried and said that our dad was supposed to pick him up for basketball practice but wasn't there. I told my brother to walk home and that I'd be there soon to check on my dad. The trip started going bad at this point. My friend and I had to walk through a very sketchy area at night surrounded by crack heads and goons. We were pretty creeped out but we had to see if my dad was okay.
395	2	a	We made it to my house and it turns out my dad had just gotten drunk again. My brother got home and was railing against our alcoholic father for forgetting that he needed to pick my brother up. I started really tripping in the next room and felt really embarrassed. 
396	2	a	My friend went home and I felt like the night was ruined. I was the highest I've ever been in my life and everything was moving and changing colors very rapidly, and I couldn't stop thinking about the problems in my life. I closed my eyes and I started hearing this old Chinese flute music, and all of a sudden I was in this beautiful place full of colorful trees, rolling grass mountains and a river at the center. The river had rocks in the middle and I could hear the water flowing, it was all very detailed and felt real. All of a sudden I felt some type of presence. I looked to my side and I saw a young Bruce Lee. This kind of creeped me out but made me happy at the same time, because Bruce Lee is a huge inspiration to me. Then I started speaking to him.
397	2	a	I said 'Damn, Bruce. My life is all types of messed up. I have an alcoholic dad, we're losing our house soon and my friend just had to see all the shit that just happened.' Then Bruce looked at me in the eyes and then pointed at the river. He said, 'Your life is just like this river. There may be rocks and obstacles in the way, but it keeps on flowing just as you will. You are 17, you will be an adult soon and all will be well.' Immediately after he said that my eyes flew open and it was like a huge realization moment. It calmed me down so much and after that the rest of my trip went very well. 
398	2	a	To this day if I start getting stressed I think of that place and moment and it calms me down greatly. It was the most rich psychedelic experience I've ever had.

400	2	a	LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Families (41), Entities / Beings (37), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
401	2	a	I, Wodin-One-Eye, still believe that LSD offers a unique avenue for Lamarckian human evolution: changing one's own DNA to an improved form. This property is (IMHO) unique to LSD and is not shared with the other major psychedelics. However, the process involves a specific danger: when the first stage is accomplished, which is marked by a Âcosmic tripÂ of a particular character, a waiting period (which I estimate at one month) is required before taking more LSD. Failure to observe the waiting period (that is, taking more LSD the next day) resulted for this user in a trip to ÂPlastic Fantastic LandÂ, an extremely undesirable result. This is probably the Âbizarre psychosisÂ mentioned in some of the stuffy and uncomprehending literature written by idiots in white coats. I recount my experience of Plastic Fantastic Land and offer some observations and conclusions. It seems to me most important to warn younger users of the specific mechanism by which I stumbled into Plastic Fantastic Land (where, I assure, I would not desire to go again).
402	2	a	I was a musician from infancy. When in 1974 I discovered that listening to music was enhanced by LSD, I determined to learn to play music on LSD. Over the course of a half-dozen trips in 1975, I was led by Spirit to choose a set and setting of a week alone (November '75) in a remote family cabin on a lake. After several days alone I took 500 micrograms (?+-) on the Thursday, before dawn, some 30 hours after the lunar eclipse (lunar phase, I believe, could be a factor influencing trips) and four weeks before the winter solstice.  
403	2	a	As I sat in the kitchen waiting, the morning sun came over the horizon; across the lake somewhere someone started a bulldozer motor, and the vibration of the sound entered my left big toe and vibrated my body and lifted me to my feet. I grabbed my guitar and rushed outside to sit on the porch in the sun.  My eyes crossed and I entered a complex hallucination in which I heard an orchestra tuning. When the vibration was at maximum, a bee flew from right to left across my field of vision, and my right eye followed it, turning 90 degrees to the left into my nose where it remained. My left eye remained straight ahead looking at the fingerboard. I began to play. In my right eye, a hallucination formed: God, the angels, and all of my male ancestors stood and listened. At my left, I saw my deceased mother being carried down to the lake in her coffin. Also at my left, I heard the Goddess moving (not speaking, not visible). I momentarily broke the spell to look to my right and see if anyone was really there Â there wasn't. I snapped back into the hallucinatory space and continued to play for perhaps hours?? and learned a great deal about music which I was able to retain, although it took many years to work out the details. I will not dwell on the many beautiful details of this few hours in Paradise. Toward the end, I got out a music stand and some sheet music. Then a Wind came and blew the sheet music off the stand, and said, ÂNow!Â I put the music and the guitar away and went out in the sailboat.
404	2	a	The cabin possessed a styrofoam sailboard about 10 feet long. The rudder attachment was broken, and on the day before I had crudely repaired it and taken it out in a mild breeze. Now, the Wind blew, and I took the boat out again. Not a sailor, I did not know to tie a loop in the rope which held the sail (1/4Â nylon twine). I held the rudder with right hand and wrapped the rope around my left hand. The Wind took me rapidly out into the lake, sailing against the wind. The rope cut into my hand. It became very difficult to hold on, and so, I quit. I had the thought, ÂI should go practice music some more!Â I turned the boat around. At this moment, embarrassing to recount, I had a sexual release and wet my pants. I could no longer control the boat, and was blown about for the entire rest of the day by the Wind. At the end of the day, at sunset, the wind died when I was 50 yards from shore near the cabin, and I paddled in. 
405	2	a	The next day, I understood that the Wind had intended to take me somewhere. So, I took another two LSD tabs, same as the day before. But it was pouring rain. I sat in the kitchen and played the blues tripping. Then I thought, Âthis won't do!Â and I went outside. Suddenly the Wind came back and blew the clouds away Â and, bingo, I was in Plastic Fantastic Land (to be described below). I got the boat out again and went out on the lake. The wind and waves were rough and shortly the rudder broke off and the boat capsized. When I righted it, the mast and sail came loose and sank. I paddled to land miles down the shore. I was barefoot, and it took me the rest of the day to walk home on the dirt shore road carrying the boat. During this walk, my head was divided in half: two separate entities inhabiting my brain, and not too happy with each other. My left testicle seemed to be painfully pulling away from my body. I got home at evening and wept. 
406	2	a	Plastic Fantastic Land is attested by two sources known to me: a series of drawings by Robert Crumb published in Zap Comix in the early '70s shows the visual imagery: trapezoidal interlocking acid patterns inhabited by reptilian humanoids, completely hallucinatory and non-living. The state is also accurately described by Marty Balin's Jefferson Airplane song, ÂPlastic Fantastic LoverÂ. Although Balin dodged the question of its meaning when asked, it appears to me that he and his lover had a cosmic trip together, probably making love, decided to take more LSD the next day, and went to Plastic Fantastic Land. It is not a nice or desirable place. My experience matched the elements of these two artistic renderings of PFL, leading me to believe that this has been a common experience, which arises because of this hubris: wanting to have the same trip again, which I now believe to be a serious spiritual error. No matter how cosmic the trip, taking more LSD the next day (although often reported to be useless due to tolerance) after such a cosmic trip, may lead to Plastic Fantastic Land. What it definitely won't do is recapture that cosmic trip. 
407	2	a	In Plastic Fantastic Land, my brain felt divided into two separate entities. In Plastic Fantastic Land, my brain felt divided into two separate entities. This was clearly related to the eye-crossing state of the day before, and to something involving the relation of right- and left-brain via the corpus callosum. In retrospect, I believe that I had on the first day re-organized the structure of both my brain and my chromosomes or DNA. (Cf. Barbara McClintock's work on spontaneous chromosome rearrangement in maize.) However, on the second day, the created structure of the day before was simply melted and destroyed by taking more LSD. It is my belief that I would have consolidated the gains from this experience by waiting for some time (a month or more: maybe a year?) before tripping again, and that I could have built on the experience.  I don't believe that there is any permanent brain damage from PFL that is not recoverable through rest, exercise, good diet and meditation. However, the psychological effect of a visit to Plastic Fantastic Land is devastating, and this is also a challenge to recovery. Sadness at Paradise Lost stayed with me for many years, and I never again was successful in achieving a set and setting that would support another such experience. For months to follow, whenever I smoked cannabis, I flashed back to PFL. 
408	2	a	The following spring, I had an unfortunate experience: severe mercury poisoning. This was unforeseen, and from an unexpected source Â I will not say more about this so as not to generate controversy. It was a private tragedy. I was brain-damaged, and lost much musical ability as well as the ability to play chess well, and many other lesser details. My family, needless to say, blamed LSD, as the mercury poisoning was invisible and unrecognized. It took many years to recover, and during this time I also blamed LSD for this sudden dysfunction (which took several months to develop to its maximum), although I was at a loss to explain the mechanism. It took me 40 years to (a) recognize my symptoms as those of mercury poisoning, and to (b) unravel the difference between the effects of LSD and mercury poisoning. This I finally achieved by taking more LSD in my old age, which allowed me to definitively say, LSD did not cause this-and-this particular type of dysfunction. However, I admit that this is a subjective opinion. On the other hand, I believe that hidden mercury poisoning is quite common and may be responsible for some symptoms blamed on drug use. For instance, before that, I never had Âreefer madnessÂ style hallucinations, but afterwards I had them whenever I even smoked cannabis. In the event, I was compelled to stop taking LSD: I entered a yoga ashram and stayed several years. 
409	2	a	After such a cosmic trip, a recovery period is necessary. Good diet (including saturated fat! IMHO!), rest, meditation and hatha yoga appear to be beneficial. Lacking a coherent recovery program at that time, I became a burnout, but this, I believe as stated above, was seriously complicated by mercury poisoning, and the effects of that lasted so many years that I was unable to pursue these questions any further. In sum, I believe that the Âcosmic tripÂ is an evolutionary opportunity for both the individual and for mankind, but that it involves necessary learning processes for such ignorant young dummies as I was, and that these learning experiences must be repeated in order to learn how to ride that tiger. There was an immediate pitfall which I fell headlong into, which was not to sensibly wait before taking more LSD. If one could avoid that dumb trap, it might be possible to build on a series of learning experiences and find out what Spirit really wants to offer us. I have also taken, later in my life, mushrooms and ayahuasca, and I find no hint that they offer the same unique DNA-shaking and DNA-changing trip that LSD did on that occasion, but then, neither do they lead to Plastic Fantastic Land, making them much safer. I also consider it highly probable that some of what I experienced with LSD may have had to do with stage-specific brain developments in late adolescence, which no longer occur or can no longer be stimulated in older people such as I am now.

412	2	a	As always, my LSD sojourns into visionary experiences receiving so much praise by others evaded me.  In the past, absurdity itself dogged my mind/body interpretation of all sorts of experiments that gave others what was expected, from Budweiser to Slivovitz, from Leper Weed to Ecstasy.  Even so,  I was surprised by the unexpected skull crushing sensations on my first LSD trial and the writhing during later trials into floor positions with muscles graced with astonishing energy.   Soon, I learned from Dr. Grof himself, that the alarming skull pressures ascending from the roof of my mouth, moving into the maxilla, climbing across my nasal bone and shearing my forehead in opposite directions was a birth memory of one born by ÂTwilight SleepÂ, an obstetric procedure abandoned thirty years after I was born.  My initial resistance to this interpretation finally gave way to the unmistakable correlation between the LSD memory and what the fetus would feel as the doctorÂs first two fingers drag the baby out of the birth canal by the roof of its mouth, producing obvious distortions of the skull in the expected sequence.  This was a real memory, it was resurrected by a very small dose (25ug) of LSD and it happened only once, disappearing totally after several days of exact encores in the form of ÂflashbacksÂ.    
413	2	a	Later trials with higher doses (100-250ug) of the same street lot of LSD produced effects of an entirely different kind, in which a two-minute spike of heart rate, blood pressure and oral temperature was followed by several cycles of twisting into fetal positions with intense flexing of all skeletal muscles.  
414	2	a	A glorious change came over me in the following two or three days, in which I was highly aware of my surroundings, as if they were new.  This was accompanied by a new state of relaxed movement without any sign of fatigue, reminiscent of the ease in which a lion or leopard walks, confident in ability.   More LSD trials produced the same stages of LSD effect and I reached unaccustomed levels of ability in sports activities.  This blissful state would not occur unless I fully participated in the muscular work during each session. This blissful state would not occur unless I fully participated in the muscular work during each session. 
415	2	a	What does one make of this?  To a biochemist, the idea that a tiny amount of drug just sufficient to cover the head of a straight pin would elicit an unforgettable nine-hour trip was, to say the least, impressive.  The temptation to account for the birth memory and for the struggles in later trials was irresistible.  A hallucinogen started a process to open a memory site for release of its contents into conscious awareness after >four decades of hiding.

417	2	a	I smoked a couple bowls before I headed over to my friend's dorm room at about noon. When I got there, I already knew I was going to drop three tabs of acid. This was extremely stupid given how strong the tabs were and that it was only fourth time on the substance. I remember taking them and my friend taking one.
418	2	a	I knew of the spiritual and mind-changing possibilities if LSD but hadn't truly broken into an ego-death experience I was about to have. The real reason I was taking the acid that day was not one someone should be taking a dose of acid like that for. I was taking it to have fun and 'trip balls' for shits and giggles. I don't remember it kicking it in and don't remember being aware of existing in reality until a little after four PM. During this time, all I can reoccur is seeing photon-light particles of all colors, way more colors than exist not on LSD, fanning out in every direction from what I later figured to be the Big Bang. As I was drifting in and out of even being in the present moment of reality, there was this kid in the dorm-room who was sober and thought it would be keen to mess with me, at least I thought.
419	2	a	I couldn't recollect anything I knew about anything and everything I knew about real life seemed like it was fake and a far-off concept. I would remember things like my name and where I was, that I was a physical object and existed with everyone else and take those thoughts as grand realizations. A pattern started to arise in my statements, 'But when'? All of time, and I mean infinity, every phenomenon that has happened or will ever happen was happening right then. I then connected the Big Bang I had envisioned earlier that day and thought I was experiencing a separate Universe, an entire Big Bang sequence that I would ride to expansion and come back the next day. As the day wore on and we were hanging out with people, they started noticing I wasn't talking much. This is because I was deep in the halls of introspection and participating socially wasn't really on the docket. By around midnight I was still tripping nutsack.
420	2	a	I ordered an Uber home and watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and then 'Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia' until the morning. The issue was that I had dosed almost 24 hours ago. I had work at noon. I was still disoriented and definitely mildly in the trip. Time took forever to go on at work. And paranoia took over. I thought for sure I was permatripping and I was trying to figure out a way to tell my family I needed to be checked into the mental hospital. I held it together on the surface the whole time, but I was extremely confused at work and was seeing things differently, I could smell a distinct smell that I figured was the trip. When I went home, I still couldn't go to sleep. I smoked and that had my thoughts racing even faster. The last I could remember was thinking about how I now had to live with Schizophrenia and how to deal with my psychosis.
421	2	a	After over 30 hours tripping I had finally passed out. I woke up once and was still a bit confused. I wasn't tripping when I woke up again but the paranoid thoughts are very consuming. The second time I woke up it was with the sunrise and I knew the trip had worn away. I turned on Pink Floyd's 'Time' and cried with urgency and gratefulness.

424	2	a	Three friends and I decided to go bush and take what had been described as very strong clean LSD-25.  Prior to taking it I did about an hour of awareness meditation.
425	2	a	The LSD took about half an hour to come on.  I sat watching the river for a while and became immersed before going out to the old growth forest to watch the trees.  I had never seen this before - they were pulsing and bulging in and out and I could see green auras around them.  I became aware of my primate side, the side that knows instinctively how to connect to the earth - the side that knows how to survive if everything fell apart tommorrow.  Funnily enough it made a lot more sense when I had all four limbs on the ground like an ape.  I definitely had a better connection with the earth when my hands which I know so well were literally connected to the earth.
426	2	a	About 2 hours into the trip I saw what I can only describe as dna sigils interweaving themselves along my arms and hands.  They flowed along perfectly with the contours of my normal physical body.  I also saw slightly different sigils on the face of my girl friend.  These visuals were constant for about 4 more hours.
427	2	a	The visual state and my mental state seemed to be in unison during this time and the feeling was as if I was connected to the earth not as an ape as before, but as a human, but a human who could move and live on the earth in a way that I have never done before.  My posture and presence actually felt different - like another being - but it was definitely me, just me in a way that was unified with the earth.  There was something childlike, but there was also adult and animal, and throughout it all I was aware of the choice to be what I want to be.
428	2	a	I have a fair amount of experience with LSD but have never experienced anything quite like this.

431	2	a	I used to live on the Gulf Coast in Mississippi, and psychedelics are seldom available save shrooms.   I had tried shrooms before eating several ounces, but my results were lackluster. I did not know what to expect, and was taking them for the notoriety of having taken them more than the experience. When I first encountered LSD it was unlike anything I had ever run across. When you hear about something called acid you would expect it to melt your brain, but it does not, not in a literal sense anyway.  A friend of a friend had come back from the Bonnaroo music festival with window pane acid and was selling it for cheap so I bought some. I had tried acid before and was amazed at the superficial visuals and the sounds that seemed to come out of nowhere, but after awhile I began to consider myself a professional tripper.
432	2	a	I began to delve into what made it tick, and why if the drug was so strong in small amounts, why it made any difference at all if I took one more than everyone else (Which I did for bragging rights, ÂI pushed myself even further than everyone else, durdur!Â).  Started to wonder where the time went, and what I was left to, where I went when  I was away.  In the height of this particular trip on the window panes I found myself in deep contemplation while I watched Robin Williams on Broadway. The things he said did not seem as funny as they did true. Why was everyone always blabbering on about Atomic weapons?  Because they were afraid of them, but why should they be afraid of them if no one will ever use them again? They should not. I found myself sorting through my fears, encountering repressed thoughts ( child abuse and the like), and looking at my friends as human beings instead of these fabricated dolls I had created in my head. I realized how accountable I had been for every action I had ever taken, and how much of my life was up to me. Before this moment I do not think I had really been conscious of my freewill. I donÂt think I had ever thought or felt anything genuine. Then I realized something potentially life shattering , this was not the drug, but my mind playing tricks and running in circles. I began to consider what life would be like seeing it from this perspective all the time, and I asked myself if I wanted to go back to living in that stupor or continue to feel this way forever. The friends who I was watching the program with realized something was wrong with me so I suggested that we go outside for some fresh air, and so that we could smoke some cigarettes ( because we were so fucking cool).
433	2	a	Outside beneath a large I told them of my revelationÂthat the drug was not real. They were not surprised. One of them told me he had figured that out several months before, and another aid that he had speculated that to be the case, but that he was not quite ready to believe something like that yet. Then there was a third friend who asked me if I wanted more acid, then he asked me if I wanted to travel to bourbon street, and all kinds of other weird things like that. I told him no each time, but he persisted as if he had not heard anything I had said. It got to the point where I felt like reaching across and punching him, but then I had another idea. Me hitting him was exactly what he was trying to get me to do. I decided to forgive him for his absurdity rather than giving into some animalistic urge. Then he broke down and cried. He told us that his Mustang meant he was cool, and then he asked us if we thought he was cool too? We went along and told him that we did. He cried more and ran through a list of things that made him think he was cool. Finally I decided I would like to go for a walk and stretch my legs in this new world I had discovered. The friend who was not ready to accept stayed with the one who would not, and the two of us began walking down a long road toward some water at the end of my street.
434	2	a	I told him that I wanted to tell other people about the way I felt. Told him that I had been living in bullshit for so long, and now everything made sense. He began to tell me about Christianity, which I was familiar with, but I had long been agnostic. The trip had not changed my agnosticism. It just made me think that I had been tripping on life, and now I was tripping on death. I had made up my mind to stop tripping period by this point. That was until he began to tell me how Christ had died for my sins and all these bible stories. He said after his BIG TRIP ( the one like I was having) the Bible helped him keep his sanity. I thought that he had felt alone after his trip, and the Bible gave him something absurd he could cling onto, but my newfound innocence got the best of me. I began to believe him about God ,Jesus, and Christianity. For months afterward I claimed that what I had experienced was salvation. My soul had been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ! People noticed a drastic change in me.
435	2	a	I had been selling pounds of pot just days before, and now I was striving to be a good Christian. It was not me, and as things do that are not, my religion eventually faded, and I found myself in a greater darkness than I had ever encountered. I felt that my friend had unknowingly betrayed me. Religion had kept him from feeling alone with the universe, but throughout my life that was all I was ever looking for. That feeling made me feel whole, and now because of this implantation of Southern Baptist doctrine I was lost againÂ.cut off from myself in every sense. Tabula Rasa, a blank slate. Now two years later IÂve managed to put myself back together not as much as I would like nowhere near as I ha that night, Substance abuse has re entered my life, though I do not find myself placing the faith in the substances as I did before. LSD on the whole has never brought me that close to something again.

438	2	a	Obviously there are a million things to be said right now but what I want to talk about it the effects of yoga after having tripped pretty hard for about an hour (which included a bus ride home) I came home.  My mom is a yoga teacher and my basement is half childs playroom half yoga studio.  I asked her if we could do some yoga, I blamed it on being stiff and tight but I soon learned that muscle and your body are all finite ideas.  Anyways we go down to the studio.  All of the lights are off except for the mood lighting.  There was chill music.  What really hit me about the yoga was feeling inside my own body.  All that bullshit yoga teachers always say stuff like 'pinch your shoulderblades back and feel your spine melting' I actually feel it and the ways that the yoga teacher describe things to me make perfect sense.  Things that dont make sense to me normally like 'lengthen your spine' make sense and I can feel it.

440	2	a	I remember wanting to have sex on lsd to see what effects it would have on me and the visuals. So me and my bf has sex and everything seemed normal visually. However, sensually was a different story I could feel everything, every bump, graze and glide. The colour around started to get brighter and move faster and as my orgasm built up so did the visuals. The colours became more vivid and the shapes became more structured and fixed together. Like a perfect puzzle. The closer my orgasm came to be the more shapes would appear and colours that I didnÂt even know existed tarted showing up around me. And I shit you not at the climax it was like a firework display going off around me. Each shape exploded into what looked like pixie dust, it was all so bright and overwhelming tbh. It took me a while to come back around. I sat there for ages just gazing at the ceiling understanding what had just happened.

443	2	a	I suffer from cluster headaches. It had started about 3 weeks prior to the trip. My friend had brought over some acid so I figures why not. Note that I didnt even know this was even possibly a cure for the headaches. Therefore there could be no placebo effect. Anyway, I started the trip and noticed the usual effects. I noticed that about 1/4 of the way along, my headaches which were quite severe that day, had completely gone away. I was astonished to feel better. Never would I think that this is a cure for anything, but it helped tremendously. The good thing is that since that day, I havent gotten any sort of cluster headaches since. Thanx cid!

446	2	a	I had a pretty traumatic experience with acid about 3 weeks prior to writing this. I had tried LSD once before that but it must have been weak or bunk because I didnt feel much. Anyways, the setting was my friends house, just me and him. I took 1 tab at first, and then another an hour later.
447	2	a	The effects of the first tab were just setting in: I was feeling detached from reality and giggly. At about an hour and a half after taking the first tab, I started getting this feeling of intense anxiety. The feeling got worse so I went to sit under his deck and calm down. I thought looking at the trees and nature would help me out. The anxiety became more and more intense as I sat in the chair and I felt completely helpless. I became paralyzed by a feeling of fear. It wasn't about anything in specific but I felt very afraid and anxious. I became paralyzed by a feeling of fear. It wasn't about anything in specific but I felt very afraid and anxious. I had some very intense visual distortions as I looked at the trees. At about 3 or 4 hours after taking the first tab, I started getting hallucinations. I saw a monkey dancing in a tree and a cartoonish type of coyote smoking a cigarette next to me. They were only in my periphery though and would disappear when I tried looking at them. I was paralyzed in this one chair by the feelings for about 5 hours. I couldn't bring my self to get up. I wasn't scared by the hallucinations though. If anything, they distracted me from the overwhelming emotions. I wasn't scared by the hallucinations though. If anything, they distracted me from the overwhelming emotions. When the trip died down at about 5 1/2 hours, I was left with the anxiety. I didn't think much of it at the time, I thought it would wear off.
448	2	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
449	2	a	I then went inside to take some bong hits and then drove home. When I got home, I couldnt sleep at all that night. I was so anxious and begining to feel extremely depressed and thought I was loosing my mind. For the next few days I experienced intense anxiety constantly. Prior to this experience, I had never experienced anything close to this level of anxiety. I experienced a vivid flashback several weeks later where I felt like I was tripping again. The intense part lasted only a few minutes but I had a detached kind of feeling for aboout an hour.

461	2	a	The first time I tripped was with 3 of my close friends and we all took one hit. This particular blotter acid was a (spider-man) and, obviously had a little picture of the face of spider-man on it. This was a wonderful experience and I felt a sense of closeness to my friends, and it was during the day, cause we had skipped school, and the sky was so big, BLUE, and beautiful. We walked through the woods for a hour just looking at plants and picking flowers and buds off different plants and bushes; I felt a real respect for the beauty and naturalness of nature. Then we came up on a railroad track, and it just so happened that a train came by at that time, and it was loud as hell. And I could feel the ground shaking.  But this isn't the bad experience.
462	2	a	The second time I tripped I really messed up. It was a week later from the previous first trip of my life, and I had gotten 3 of these (spider-mans), and from what I had heard from experienced trippers was that these spider-mans were good, and I agreed considering my first trip. I bought 3, one for me, my best friend who I hadn't tripped with and his brother. We had planned to do it on a saturday night. Unfortunately, my parents had planned to go to a nascar race early the nest morning and I had to be there real early at like 5am,so I could watch my little sister. SO I was at home alone, cause my parents were in bed sleeping, and my friend corey and his brother had decided to go to a club since we weren't tripping. I stayed up late that night watching t.v. Cause I was bored and at 12 started to watch 'Space Cowboys', and I was bored and wanted to have some fun and took one spider-man, after and hour into the movie I felt as if it wasn't really effecting me, and being a unexperienced user of acid; not knowing the power of it; and still questing for that true trip, like in the movies and stuff where u have alot of visuals. So wanting more effect I took the other 2. So now I have 3 spider-mans in me and I'm watching 'space Cowboys', I first started to notice that Clint Eastwood's face looked real weird and sort of twisted, and in the movie they're working on this satellite in outer space that is supposedly this Russian communication satellite. But in the movie its a conspiracy, and the satellite is actually this nuclear warhead satellite still up in space from the cold war. Now when this things goes into attack mode, I felt like I was in a dam I-max theatre, and this thing was giant, and I was like ok I'm tripping now, so I turn it off and go to my computer and start to play a computer game called Counter-Strike, but I find myself just staring off into the screen and like breaking down every pixel on the monitor, so return to the television but only to flip through the channels, and note this was only my second time tripping and the first time I didn't have any real visuals, but this time I was in for some.
463	2	a	I turn on the T.v. And start to watch ESPN and they have a male aerobics contest. Except I cant hear the announcers no matter how hard I concentrate, I never knew acid could effect the hearing. The contestants are jumping around on stage, moving real fast, but he scary part was all their heads were shaping into demons, and they were growling, so I flip to ESPN2, this one is sportscenter, and as they were showing the highlights all the games were in total slow motion to me, no matter how hard I tried it wouldn't stop moving in slow motion, and then I flip to HBO where they were playing 'Lake Placid', the one with the giant killer crocdile, and the peoples' faces kept shifting, and there skin would peel back off their face into another shape, and I saw some scary scenes that I can't really remember, but now at this point I have this deep dark fear, and not being able to handle it  I decide to try to fight it and just goto bed, so I go upstairs and lie in my bed, I remember just lieing there playing with my hands, and looking at feet which seemed to be a mile away at the end of the bed, I felt a fear that I wouldn't come out of it cause I had taken too much and remember thinking that over and over that I was going to go into a permanent trip, and when my parents got up to get ready for the race I was still tripping lieing in my bed tense and frozen like a stiff dead person trying to pretend I was asleep as my mom came in to my room to say by, but she skipped across the room; and I couldn't even understand the words she said, and as she left I thought about how much I loved her and how mad she would be if she knew of the stupid shit that I do, and my little sister came in and layed with me after my parents left and this was like 7 in the morn, and she noticed that I was wide awake, and she asked me what was wrong and I just began to cry and told her she would never understand, then I got up at took a shower, when I got out I felt so cold and body felt like crap so I layed in bed again, and just went into a daze and I don't know if I fell asleep or not but at like 11am I came to my senses, and got up and was delighted to notice that I wasn't tripping anymore, and my eyes weren't dialated and I could actually think. I swore that I would never trip again, but I have many times since then, but nothing ever close to that night.

465	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Alone (16)
466	2	a	Before my first trip I had experimented with many drugs. I felt like I had explored the vastness of my mind to the extreme. While having many a high time, I had given up on drugs having the ability to take me to new realities. Shortly before my trip my life was in chaos. I was gaining weight, jobless, self indulgent, and utterly wasteful. My mindset was that of a curious 15 year old, yet I was 21. So this being my reality, a close friend procured some blotter.
467	2	a	I took the hit with an open mind. within an hour my friend and I felt as if we were reading each others minds. Barely having to conjure up words to express emotions. The sensation was all mental with an intense body buss. Soon however, I was in the grips of my own inner demons. My fears and thoughts were out on display for me. I realized how pathetic and immature I had been. Careless and selfish, disgusting. I changed forever that night. I realized I was a man, I had a healthy body and spirit within begging me to allow it to thrive and glow. Begging me to become a man. since this experience my life in general has improved a great deal. I exist in a new, enlightened reality. The trip is over, but just like a trip to the Grand Canyon, it's greatness will always be a memory within me. If I loose faith, I remind my self how strong I am. I believe this experience has probably been shared by many people, We are united through this...we understand.

469	2	a	LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Glowing Experiences (4), General (1)
470	2	a	It was a Monday evening after school when my buddies G and N told me that they just got word from our dealer that he's got 
471	2	a	A great deal on some Storm-trooper acid tabs. My buddies and I were all experienced trippers (so I thought). I tripped around 8 times, N around 10 and G about 7. This time I wanted to take 3 I've only taken 2 at most in the past which I thought was the 
472	2	a	Perfect dose, but N said I should at least just experience 3 one time, so I did. My buddies and I drove up to meet our guy to get the tabs, I got my 3, N his 2 and G his 2. I wanted to wait and trip with my other buddies D and A on the weekend coming up but it was a Thursday morning when I ended up staying home 'sick' I thought it would be the perfect time.
473	2	a	On that Thursday morning I made a dumb decision, I popped the 3 in with a positive but also slightly nervous feeling. I sat on my computer reading through some articles about news and listening to music, 25 minutes in I felt it, I realized then what I was 
474	2	a	In for. It was 6:35 a.m when I took the tabs. Once I really started feeling it I decided to relax in bed and watch the new X-MenDays of Future Past, and boy was that something...the color's were unbelievable, the feelings were amazing this in my head.
475	2	a	Was the coolest experience I've ever had. After the movie was done I got up and just starred out my window looking at the sky, the trees, my pool, the cars passing behind my house. I was astonished by everything I was seeing, and a weird thought
476	2	a	popped into my head. I thought about some of the people I knew and how they had to grind for what they have. I know people who have barely anything with crazy screwed up lives...no parents, no money, barely a roof over their head, but me? Well I had everything my parents were still together, I had money, I had a roof over my head, I was spoiled. All those thoughts just clicked in my head and I started bawling my eyes out harder than I ever had before because I treated my parents like sh*t even though they did everything for me and I realized how lucky I was. All those thoughts just clicked in my head and I started bawling my eyes out harder than I ever had before because I treated my parents like sh*t even though they did everything for me and I realized how lucky I was. This was the life changing part in my trip because after this, I treated my parents with so much more respect and rarely ever talked back to them...they had no idea that LSD was the change to that.
477	2	a	Now on to where my trip went from excellent to terrible in the matter of seconds...it was 7 hours into my trip, I was texting my buddy D and telling him about it, he then replies with 'Bro, how are you still tripping that hard? You should've reached your peak by now?' After reading that text I thought for some reason my brain was fried for the rest of my life, I thought I would be tripping forever...And even though in the middle of the trip I knew that it was just the Acid I couldn't control it...I was freaking out. I lost my mind, I would go from my bed, to my computer chair, to walking back and fourth repeating my name...address...middle name just to keep myself from thinking I'm crazy...At that point I just wanted to talk to someone, I NEEDED someone. My brother, and dad were home BUT I knew if I were to say a word to them they would think I'm crazy, and to me at the time I thought I would just stay in my perpetual loop and end up in a mental institution. It was finally 2:45 p.m when D got home I made him get on skype to talk and help me. D would ask me questions and I couldn't even respond or barely comprehend what he said...I kept trying to explain what was happening but I couldn't even remember anything...my train of thought was obliterated. Eventually I realized I was stuck in my first acid loop that I remembered reading about. D looked it up and just told me that I had to relax. After a little over an hour my mind was once again stable. After that experience I've never touched drugs again.

479	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Bad Trips (6), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Alone (16)
480	2	a	During the Winter of 2005 I came across some good quality LSD.  I had only tripped on the substance twice before, but I am very experienced with other hallucinogens.  LSD is tough to come by in Northern Virginia where I live, at least with the few connections I have.  So I purchased 8 hits and took 2 the weekend before to test it out.  I tripped a little bit and got a lot of morphing and coloration changes, but no visuals, leaving me a little disappointed.  The LSD was relatively cheap so I had planned to go into school to take a test and then go home sick right after and chomp down all six of my remaining tabs.
481	2	a	I woke up excited next morning, eager to begin my trip.  It had just begun to sprinkle snowflakes on this beautiful Virginian morning.  I arrived to take my test at 8:00 AM sharp.  I brought the LSD with me and had decided that I wanted to be tripping when I got back home, so 15 minutes into my 45 minute examination, I ate my tabs.
482	2	a	T 0:00 - At precisely 8:15 AM, I ate all six tabs, then hurried to finish my test.
483	2	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
484	2	a	T 0:30 - By the time I finished my test I was coming up strong.  I handed in my test, and scurried out of school.  It was strange leaving, the patterns on the floor began morphing.  I decided to walk into the bathroom to check myself and take a piss before hitting the road.  My pupils were very dilated and I had the appearance of someone high on drugs.  It was still snowing when I got out to my car, so I hopped in, popped some good tunes in my CD player, I think it was United States of America, good stuff, and proceeded to make the 30 minute drive home.
485	2	a	T 0:45-1:30 - The snow has lightly dusted the grounds on the highway that I travel on and the wind is blowing the snow around, giving the road the appearance as though the ground was moving.  Also, I would like to clear one thing up.  The trees are covered with snow, which reminded me of Narnia.  I felt blissful and tranquil, eager to get home and rip out my bong.
486	2	a	T 1:30-2:30 - I arrive at my house and greet my dog, a shaggy, black-haired dog who is always around me.  He has smoked with me on a lot of occasions and I believe he enjoys the habit.  Whenever I arrive home from school, I always take him outside and rip a bowl before my mom gets home.  He sits right beside me and looks up at me, eager to get a shotgun.  It is now snowing very hard, and I look outside to see that my car is completely covered, so I decide to take my bong out and box it up.  My dog is terrified of the snow, so he wouldn't come along.  I enter my car and put in some Grateful Dead to back my trip.  I proceed to smoke at least an eighth of pot, and by the time I exit my vehicle I am tripping exceedingly well.  I decide that it's such a nice day, so I should go for a walk.  I grab my iPod and go walk around my neighborhood, which is a truly gorgeous piece of land, with tall trees, nice houses, and woods surrounding it.  I walk around for about thirty minutes but decide to go back inside cause I was cold.
487	2	a	T 2:30-3:30 - There is a hill beside my house that is pretty steep that has since been developed on, but ever winter my brother and I make a ramp at the top of it and jumps at the bottom.  The ramp is solely used to collect speed.  I grab my snowboard and go out and mess around for a little while, though I am physically inept at this point and can't land a thing.  I walk back inside and make a few cocktails and watch a movie, the Doors.
488	2	a	T 3:30-5:30 - I'm still tripping delighfully hard.  My own trip experience completely correlated with the movie, which I only realized until after the movie.  I'll admit it, I am an alcoholic, so I found many parallels between me and Oliver Stone's inaccurate portrayal of Jim Morrison.  I was tripping almost at my peak when the band goes out into the desert to do acid.  As I am making more and more drinks and getting a little drunk, Morrison breaks away from his band and starts doing cocaine and drinking to excess, just as I am now doing.  By the end of the movie I'm still tripping, but not nearly as hard as before.
489	2	a	T 5:30-7:00 - I go to smoke a few more bowls to try and get back up.  It works surprisingly well.  I decide to make a fire cause it was getting chilly in my humble abode.  As I look into the fire, I see tremendous colors, brilliant and vibrant colors, colors that I didn't know existed.  The flame turns solid gold and I am absolutely enthralled by the whole experience.  I watch a little while longer then retreat to my room to play guitar.
490	2	a	T 7:00-12:00 - My trip comes to a close in these hours.  All in all it was a great experience, that lead to the creation of my new motto when it comes to hallucinogens: trip hard or don't trip at all.
491	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
492	2	a	This was my first real experience with LSD. I acquired a strip of geltabs from a strange man I came across. I have had much experience tripping with Dxm, Mushrooms, Salvia, Ketamine, Morphine etc... I knew that I was mentally prepared for whatever may come during this experience. 
493	2	a	It was about 11 p.m. on a saturday night, I had just finished a long work week and had the next day with no responsibilities. I broke 3 pieces off the strip and put them on my toungue until they dissolved. About an hour later I joined my crew. They were all excited about going on a journey.
494	2	a	I started tripping around 12 a.m. I couldn't stop petting this dog that had a mane and resembled a lion. The next thing I knew we were following these strange people we met to a place they called the 'Land of Moses'. 
495	2	a	We arrived at the Land of Moses around 2 a.m. It turned out to be a graveyard in the middle of Nowhere Indiana. By now I was tripping very intensely. There was a strange woman guiding us the whole way. Her name was Carrie. We walked throughout the graveyard and made it to a giant statue of a man holding a sword. Carrie spoke of the Statue never facing the same direction. We watched as the lights around it flickered violently. Some sort of electrical Fury. I could feel an intense energy that defied any other trip I'd ever had. Soon Carrie's stories had my girlfriend so scared that she was in tears. The look in Carrie's eyes was so mesmerizing. She looked like she was on LSD as well, but I knew that she was not. She spoke of possessions and figures in the graveyard. Several of the people with us saw something walking in the distance and became frightened. The energy was so strong. 
496	2	a	The next thing I saw was the peak of my life. A dream I had previously had kept flashing through my mind. Deja Vu was so strong. I grabbed my girl and held her as close as I could and felt her heart touch mine. At that very moment and train ran by less then 30 yards away from us. It was so bright and loud. I knew that this was the highest peak I'd ever reached. Complete chaos. The train was running by, so bright. Every star in the sky swirling, tree branches moving like life-like limbs. Utter insanity. I cannot describe my emotion.
497	2	a	Soon the train passed and Carrie led us to a bridge. We parked on it, and I realized that it was 3 a.m. There were 3 cars parked here, each containing 3 people. Carrie spoke of 3 being the death hour. This did not frighten me. I felt like something had just been tapped into. Some kind of peak that's so hard to explain. 
498	2	a	Minutes passed and Carrie parted ways with us, She gave us directions back to old Fort Wayne (home), and we were on our way. I spent the rest of the trip in complete awe, just absorbing the memory of that moment when the train ran by. This was definitely the highest experience of my life.

500	2	a	This trip happened at a huge music festival. This was my first time that I tripped really hard and it was overall a very positive experience. My and one of my friends took 2.5 hits at about 1 PM. We sat around and talked for about a half hour, and when we both started to feel some initial effects come on we started walking to the festival area. We decided to split up from the rest of our friends that were with us so we could be free to go off and adventure without being tied down to a big group. 
501	2	a	By the time we got to the festival area we were both starting to feel very upbeat and giggly. After walking all the way there we sat in the grass near one of the stages and waited for the show to start while we checked out the schedule and planned our day. We cracked some jokes and were laughing really hard. When the show started, we went up to the front. The band was awesome and it felt great to move to the music. 
502	2	a	After a few songs, we figured it would be a good idea to go see one of the crazy side-shows going on at one of the tents. By the time we got there we were starting to trip pretty hard. We sat down in the tent and waited for the show to start. We had a really interesting conversation with someone near us about how crazy the whole festival experience is. I felt like I was speaking really profoundly and me and my friend were both cracking up. There were decorative chandeliers hanging from the tent that seemed to sway back and forth. The show began and it was immediately very visually appealing. The opening act had 3 women dancing in golden clothing and they were waving around golden cloth that seemed to shimmer. The colors, lights, and music were all very vivid and spectacular. 
503	2	a	We left before the show ended and we both felt like wandering around and just watching all the people around. It felt amazing to walk and my legs felt a little rubbery. I noticed I was sweating and the water felt very strange on my skin, and I loved how slippery it felt on my forehead and between my fingers. I couldnÂt hold back a huge smile from my face! We started talking to some drunk girls at one point and we were both laughing because they had no idea what we were experiencing. Conversation was difficult and required a lot of thought, but I felt I could still get a point across normally with some added effort. I felt like I could walk forever. We ended up going all the way to the main stage and caught a couple songs from the band there. 
504	2	a	As we walked to another stage to go to a show that was starting soon, we randomly ran into the rest of our friends. When we saw them, they looked very different to me and it was very surreal. We talked a little bit with our other friends, but conversation was becoming more and more difficult. I felt like I wanted to talk with my friend who was tripping about what we were both experiencing, but it became more and more difficult to put things into words. My reality was starting to fall apart a little bit and I noticed that all of my normal judgments about things were suspended and I could think about them in a different way.
505	2	a	It was liberating and confusing at the same time because I was starting to realize the complete subjective-ness of all experience and my brain had nothing to grasp as solid ground. This is an extremely difficult feeling to put into words, and it really opened my mind to different possibilities and ways of thinking. I also thought about how awesome and free the whole music festival scene is, with so many people into so many different kind of things, all having radically different subjective experiences and mindsets. It made me realize how true it is that there is no objectivity when it comes to human experience and behavior. I realized how deep down weÂre all so different from each other, and that itÂs not only just o.k. to do your own thing but itÂs also amazing!
506	2	a	We walked over to another concert nearby and arrived right on time. The band started to play, and after a minute I realized they werenÂt playing any real songs and were just improvising. They were really gelling and were playing some very spacy, atonal music. I was hearing how they kept subtly surprising each other and exploring different tonal areas seemlessly. If I focused my attention, I could hear great intricacy in the way they played every note. We left after about 30 minutes to go catch another show. We sat down towards the back and had a conversation with this really bubbly, free-spirited girl who I think was also tripping on something. Her voice was very calming and I enjoyed the conversation, though speech was still difficult. After she left, I laid down in the grass and stared up at the sky. I was getting very intense visuals looking at the clouds and they appeared to swirl around and I could see waves go across the sky along with the music. I told my friend to do the same and offered him my sunglasses. We laughed about the common experience and how it made absolutely no sense to our logical brains but nonetheless it was very real in our minds. This was a strange duality to me of being completely out of my mind, but yet still present, collected, and completely able to communicate!
507	2	a	After that concert ended, we walked along a trail that goes through a small forest with really cool looking trees. There was a man doing sound therapy for donations there and we laid down nearby to take some time to recharge a little. The sound of the gongs he was using were calming and I felt deeply at peace. Laying down in the woods and staring up at the trees swaying in the woods was blissful. I wanted to stay there forever, but my friend wanted to go see the next concert and we had to leave. 
508	2	a	We went up to the very front at the concert and found our other friends who were there. It was very crowded and I felt uncomfortable. Shortly after, the concert started and I was really enjoying the music for the first few songs. One of my friends sparked up a joint and passed it to me. I was feeling really good still and I figured it would be a good idea to hit it, but I turned out to be way wrong. The next song the band played was a very heavy, aggressive song, and it freaked me out a little bit and I started to feel bad vibes. After the song, the band started smoking a blunt on stage, and then threw it into the crowd near me, and one of my friends caught it. Instantly, it was a frenzy for everyone around to get a hit off of it, and I just felt caught in a vortex of bad vibes. My friends all passed it around our own circle and smoked most of it before passing it to anyone else around us (which I thought was a huge dick move). I passed on it, not wanting anything to do with it. At that point, I just wanted to get out of there, but it was so crowded that I was pretty trapped. I couldnÂt get into the music after that, and my mind was getting very negative. I was pissed that I had smoked and that it was giving me a bad trip. ThatÂs when I had a huge revelation that I donÂt even like smoking anymore, even though IÂve smoked regularly for years, often daily. I realized that it has always just brought me down more than anything, making me paranoid, self-conscious, and lazy. This was a very liberating discovery to me, and felt like a weight off of my back, even though I was still not having a good time. 
509	2	a	I was so glad when the concert was over, even though it was a band I normally like. My friends couldnÂt stop talking about how amazing the show was, and I was having a hard time explaining exactly why I didnÂt enjoy it. I was able to put it behind me, though, and I enjoyed the rest of the day. It started to get dark and there were now brilliantly colored lights all over the place to check out.
510	2	a	I was no longer peaking but definitely still feeling effects. We went back to our campsite later and I had a blast just improvising on my guitar. I felt like I played more rhythmically and creatively than I ever have, which was cool. I started playing the rhythm guitar part for ÂDark StarÂ and jammed on it with one of my friends and it was a blast. All in all, it was a really great trip and I felt like I benefited from being able to see the world through a different lens for a day. I was able to more objectively look at my life and my personality, and I feel that was of great value. I feel like there is so much more that I could write about it, but itÂs so hard to put that type of experience to words.  I think music festivals are perfect settings for doing acid I look forward to doing it again some time down the road.

512	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Festival / Lg. Crowd (24)
513	2	a	I remember the first time this happened to me. It was a night of madness. We all ate the acid inside the house and waited for it to kick in. then we continued smoking marijuana like crazy, as we were doing before, the whole afternoon, and drinking beer, hanging out.
514	2	a	Man, it was the strongest trip everyone had ever had. As I was the most drug hungry, I took twice more than them. It was sometime at night already, and we were being very noisy with the music playing really loud and everyone screaming to talk to each other. The new sensations and thoughts we becoming more apparent and we perceived quickly that something was changing. We were all going mad. At some point I forgot I had taken the drug.
515	2	a	I went to the kitchen and became fascinated by Portuguese tiles on the wall! Oh my, were they beautiful! Patterns of interlocking rings of the most vivid blue, each one slowly turning, clockwise and counter-clockwise. My resting right hand melted against my forehead, and the Pink Floyd album playing on the background was my only reality. ÂWhat are these weird and exquisitely beautiful noises?!Â I didn't even remember who they were, or that there was any way out of that sound. And that was just the first wave.
516	2	a	After that, my friend asked me to roll us a joint and I couldn't really recognize his face, only stare at it. It was so beautiful and expressive! Midway rolling the joint, I caught myself wondering where did that green thing come from and what was it for and why they were so eagerly waiting for it. I couldn't finish the joint and handed it away to my friend.
517	2	a	I felt the whole house we were in was alive. Everything breathed.  I had no concept of me. I had no idea who I was. I tried at some point to hang on to the memories or places or duties that were familiar to me, whatever I thought would made me, me, because I was terrified. All in vain. I was gone.
518	2	a	When we all went out the backyard to have the smoke, one of my friends commented that soon it would be the break of dawn. Only then, I realized time was split into daylight time and nighttime. I didn't even remember that! Then, my friend handed me some bread and I just stared at it. He said: Eat it! Do you know how to do it?!Â Haha! I got a kick from it, because indeed I had forgot we human beings eat! And that reminded me that we are all animals.
519	2	a	So much had been experienced that I was getting exhausted of everything and was wondering a way out of that. All that existence. I thought, ÂMaybe if I sleep, IÂll be able to rest from all this...Â But then I realized thereÂs no way out. Sleeping wouldn't satiate my need. I needed a break from existence.
520	2	a	Then we heard the cops siren! Everyone went crazy. We all started running nonsense and they shouted from the outside: ÂStop right there!Â Man, that was the rush of my life! So I froze right there at the corridor, totally frozen, and waited. One of my friends went up the stairs and saw through the balcony a police car and two cops arresting a shirtless man on the street. On our street. He came back and told everybody it was going to be okay, that they werenÂt raiding the house and we wouldnÂt go to jail or get killed.
521	2	a	After that, we chilled a bit, and I came down very fast. The sun shone and two of my friends went to the bake house and bought us all some orange juice and freshly baked bread for breakfast.

523	2	a	Over the past three years I have experimented with various drugs but only delved into the world of acid this year. 
524	2	a	My first ever experience with acid was fairly tame as I think the tab was not very potent but I felt very euphoric and had good visuals. 
525	2	a	It wasn't until my second acid trip that I truly felt the power of this crazy paper magic. I dropped the tab with two friends around 7pm summer time so it was still going to be light for several hours however I anticipated that I would want to stay inside so we chilled in my friend's bedroom. Almost as soon as the effects kicked in around 30 minutes later I felt an immediate need to go outside. Only one of my friends wanted to join me so we went for a walk and this was absolutely amazing. Everything danced and formed patterns, I felt elated and mesmerised by all the colours I could see over everything and the earth looked as though it was breathing. 
526	2	a	Things stayed pleasant and amazing for a while until we returned home. My friend's house is filled wit ornaments, toys and crazy wallpaper which all wriggled and changed colours. Being inside at this point was very overwhelming and I had to leave again. We all went outside and things started to get weird. I slowly began forgetting who I was, where I lived, what I do in life, what me and my friends were doing and I was obsessed with knowing where we going even when we had chosen to sit and relax. 
527	2	a	I forgot I was on acid, I felt like the same people kept passing us as we sat on a park bench and I struggled to see if things were really close or really far away. I knew something was weird but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I felt like I was in some dreamy state, I couldn't talk and I couldn't really get my head around what other people were saying. I could understand each individual word but the whole sentence sounded like jibberish. 
528	2	a	It was actually quite stressful and overwhelming until I finally remembered we were on a drug It was actually quite stressful and overwhelming until I finally remembered we were on a drug and that this crazy weird feeling would stop and suddenly my trip returned to being blissfully happy and entertaining. 
529	2	a	As I started coming down I took a second tab and went home. In my room, I listened to music and laid in the dark with my eyes closed enjoying the closed-eye visuals but annoyingly I fell asleep about 3 hours later. I don't really know how, I just suddenly woke up in the morning and felt like I had wasted the tab as I barely reached the second peak!
530	2	a	I have done acid a few times since but have yet to experience any spiritual awakening or reach any great epiphanies which was my main goal in doing acid but I think I will try two tabs in the future. 
531	2	a	From my experiences, bad trips are easy to trigger but equally easy to avoid and easy and easy to turn around. I think I just needed to do it a couple times to be able to know what to expect and how to control a seemingly out of control experience! 
532	2	a	I am planning on doing LSA Morning Glory seeds soon for a second time and LSD in the near future.

534	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Retrospective / Summary (11), Various (28)
535	2	a	This experience happened about 4 months ago. I had only tripped on LSD twice, both times around 2 tabs worth, so I was still pretty inexperienced with psychedelics at the time. My roommate on the other hand has dropped dozens of times with absurd amounts. I believe the most he took at one time was around 1400ug. I'll refer to him as M. We both got a little more than we were asking for.
536	2	a	It was a Monday night at my home and my roommate had picked up some LSD tabs from a pretty reliable source. He cut roughly 3/4 of a tab and tested it with a reagent kit to ensure it was legitimate, and then ate it. He asked if I wanted a tab, and I said no at first as it was a Monday night and I had classes the next day. After about 20 minutes, I thought about it again and decided to take it, since I wasn't sure when the next time I was going to have an opportunity to drop again. 
537	2	a	Both me and my roommate sat in the living room waiting for the come-up. Maybe 20 minutes after taking the tab, M looks at me and says ÂI've never tripped so hard in my life!Â. At first I thought he was joking. He hadn't even taken a full tab, and I assumed it probably lost a lot of potency with the reagent kit. He then goes into his room, and I turn on the song Echoes by Pink Floyd. At some point during the song, I started getting extremely intense visuals. The wrinkles in my jeans suddenly turned into a wavy ocean. I was both amazed by how a substance could do something like that, but also fucking terrified. I only had gotten tracers and some mild movement on my 2 previous acid trips. The music was able to keep me calm for a while, as it is my favorite song of all time. If you've ever heard echoes, you'd know that it gets extremely dark right in the middle for about 4 minutes. This is when things started to get really crazy. The whole room went dark and began changing shapes; the walls were warping and I started trying to hold on to anything that I could use as a reference to real life.
538	2	a	I eventually had enough intellect to turn the song off. I eventually had enough intellect to turn the song off. At that point the vibe became a lot brighter, but not any less intense. I eventually went to my roommate's room hoping that some company would help me keep some sort of grip on reality, but it really didn't help at all. Every time I looked at him, I saw dozens of rainbow fractal versions of his face, but they weren't really visual. It's almost like I was halfway in my head dreaming about this, but still seeing it at the same time. 
539	2	a	I then lost touch with reality completely. I have no idea how far in the trip this occurred, as I had the thought process of a 2 year old at that point. If I wanted to fly to another part of the room, I could do it. I would be lying on the couch, but in my mind it was an extremely vivid feeling of flying to the other part of the room. My thoughts and imagination were differentiable. I honestly thought I permanently went insane. 
540	2	a	I started to finally get a grip on reality again after some time. I started remembering things from my physics class, and I knew that laws of physics can only exist in the physical world. At first, I lifted my hand up and let gravity take it down. I slowly started to establish what was real and what wasn't real. I started feeling the couch, recognizing that it was a physical thing and not something I made up in my head. This went on for a while until I was completely grounded again. I still had intense visuals, such as seeing shifting in brick walls and objects warping, and this actually went on through the next day. M said the same thing as well.
541	2	a	I've tripped multiple times after this, with my highest dose being ~350ug, and that trip didn't even come close to the intensity of this one. I asked other people that had taken the same batch, and they all had similar experiences from just 1 tab. Moral of the story- don't underestimate 1 tab. It could be VERY overlaid.

543	2	a	LSD (2) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
544	2	a	I took my 175ug tab at 10:15 pm. I was sitting on a chair on the back porch surrounded by my old pals that I hadn't seen in months. I let the tab sit under my tongue and swallow it after about 15 minutes. I thought swallowing the tab could decrease the intensity if this were a dose I couldn't handle. (I was probably wrong but I felt safer this way). 
545	2	a	I just sit and watch my bud play DJ hero and have some laughs. After about 35 minutes I find myself on the ground mesmerized by the carpet. I notice the fabric move around almost like worms (take with a grain of salt). 
546	2	a	Now I'm an hour in, and I head outside for a cigarette. I'm starting to come to terms with how the chemical feels. I lay on the ground with music on and watch the stars slightly fall before me. I head inside and just chill while they watch videos and smoke dabs. Though I know trip sitters should be sober, I made this exception, seeing as I too had taken just 2 small dabs. The feeling now was almost strictly bodily, like I was completely sunk into my comfy chair. I make small talk with my close friend's brother. I have one more smoke and head into my friends basement at 3am. 
547	2	a	I get behind his piano and fiddle around, really try to get my pent up music energy out. At this point I understand this 'at home' feeling I've read about. Every other moment feels welcoming, like a new perspective has brought me warm hospitality. Now close to 4am I lay on the couch in my friends basement while he rest on the couch a few feet away. I put on some of my favorite music including bedroom pop like Starry Cat and some Explosions In The Sky. Visually, I found myself lost in the album covers on the tv screen. It was like one still frame was a whole psychedelic masterpiece. if I notice a certain pattern, it tends to be repeated and repeated. I can somewhat control where my visuals take me. 
548	2	a	I learned a lot of information on acid. Lots of answers to questions without thinking too hard, answers seem to roll off my head. Like art. Art was one of the most important realizations during this trip. I realized that life was created somehow, just as art is, simply created, making universal consciousness art itself. I realize that the mind is the most sincere form of art. 
549	2	a	Another effect from the trip was out of control bodily movements. I lay on the couch for hours letting my mind shut off the best it can and my arm moves high across my cold face. I tend to be moving and rubbing my clothes a lot. This movement keeps me grounded throughout the duration of my experience. This lead me to become connected to the universal pulse that moves within us, in our hearts. The music playing from the TV definitely amplified this 'pulse' idea. For awhile I trick myself into thinking if I wasn't moving I'd have bad thoughts, though this subsides.  Other visual aspects included staring at the little specs and glares on the sink and having them completely cover my visual field. On the couch I trace and draw on the fabric for over an hour, with the light from the TV shading the room, while crib mobiles hang from the ceiling. 
550	2	a	The hours that followed were somewhat zombie-like. I presumed this to be the 'comedown'.  I woke up my friend to ask if I could go watch the sun rise on his back porch. The screen doors were left open so I was welcomed with fresh air and a chilly temperature. I wander around viewing the rising sun and just explore around in his backyard. I head back inside and wrap a big blanket around me on the couch. I let the hours pass as I feel a bit burned out and sweaty, fairly aware of my altered mindset. I concluded that Acid can really hurt my brain if I try to gain control, it's like my conscious will try to push Lucy out of the driver's seat and it will disturb her greatly. Every time I thought 'I'm on acid right now?! I didn't really need to do this did I!?' I'd feel a pinch in my brain and readjust myself.
551	2	a	This substance is made for people who can easily watch life go by without worrying or putting in maximum conscious effort. I see now why meditation is an important skill to have. Overall this was a pleasant and somewhat enlightening experience. Though the comedown the day after is difficult to overcome. Still slight feelings of disconnection and numbness but definitely a more open mind and a better acceptance of my outer and inner universe; especially now after puffing some grass. 
552	2	a	I plan on using this substance only few times in my life, because now I'm aware of the beneficial yet overwhelming at times chemical.

554	2	a	It was time again. Every couple of years Tom felt, he would tell his closest friends, 'acid calling'. Wondering whether these intuitions were the product of self-hypnosis/delusion or just some cultural hippie norm he had picked up subconsciously, he got into the car with with two of his traveling companions to drive a few hundred miles to a contact of theirs. Being of the persuasion, that there are essentially two kinds of acid, the acid approaching purity produced with a lot of care and the mediocre nonsense that he had found to be of less worth than the piece of cardboard it had been dropped onto, he didn't care as to whether this belief was factually true or not. He just found that procuring a bottle of Acid  in an alcohol solution from a specific contact was 'appropriate in effect' for the circle he found himself experimenting with in that time. Better in subjective experience than the blotters and sugar cubes even after an expert had maintained 'acid is acid, man... it either works or it doesn't'. It was a pilgrimage to procure the bottle, with battles and problems that had to be confronted or laid aside along the whole route: traffic jams, stormy weather, route changes and adjustments as well as no place to stay at their destination. All this trouble and stress to procure a little bottle of madness juice.
555	2	a	On the journey back home the three of them had decided to visit a botanical garden that was displaying a rare carnivorous plant in bloom. As Julia was a plant person, this stop was mandatory and the botanical garden was rewarding and what Andy liked to call 'authentifying'. At the entrance however, the group was told that the flower had just fallen. The bloom lasting only around two to three days, the plant's flower had finally given way to gravity about an hour before the arrival of the returning pilgrims. 'It's clear what happened here... the acid did that' was Andy's response 'It dissolves everything, even this monster flower at a distance, so when we approached with the bottle...'. The day was one of those breezy summer days and the botanical park around the greenhouses was filled with strong old trees; the kind that have character and beards of moss that are softer than mattresses when they aren't too wet or too dry. The place was relaxed, beautiful, and quiet enough to tolerate a session on the part of this group and so a toast was made to the security guards; their ability to stay out of sight was a skill that the so-called guardians, protectors and police people of our society could learn from. Tom hoped that no 'hooligan druggies' would ever find this place to necessitate more security and trash cans and coke machines and fast food stalls and that kind of what he considered to be consumerist crap spoiling nature's performance.
556	2	a	Only 20 minutes after a glass of Mango juice with 2 drops out of the bottle, Tom found himself wrestling with the day's first issue. In his late twenties, a part of himself had always thought his career would pick-up sooner and was hurting him. An impatience was brewing inside of him with all the compromises he had made and all the concessions his art had to suffer in the process. Instead of studying music and working for diplomas in teaching, he felt he should've just went for it and become a full time singer-songwriter. He blamed himself for being a typical hypocrite coward to walk the 'safe route'. Then the mp3 player jumped to his Playlist with songs by Charles Ives for piano and voice. The turning point in this episode was remembering that Ives had actually become an insurance executive instead of trying to live of his music. The reason for this was simple: Ives didn't want to be in a situation wherein he was forced to sell his baskets. Instead, he made money in business and bought his own freedom along with helping many young composers feed themselves and live. When he was free in this sense, he was able to write the most original, experimental, and courageously beautiful songs. He was not the bitch of any audience or crowd and he didn't have to accept pay from idiots that knew less about music than children know intuitively. 
557	2	a	Beauty to Ives was not simply prettiness, sweetness, darkness, coolness or any other limiting aesthetic criteria and it certainly could not be adequately grasped by language. But most of all it was something that we don't really know. 
558	2	a	Tom had always felt jealous about not being popular enough or people not recognizing his passion and had thought that success in a commercial and career sense was something admirable and something absent from his life. Acid on that particular day changed that negative emotion. Instead of successful singer-songwriters and famous bands and musicians deemed to be excellent, he saw a bunch of empty idol worship. After all, Pavlovian research had shown 100 years ago that all that is needed to like a song is repetition and 'getting used to it'. People can be hypnotized to like any crap as long as you repeat it often enough; just look at how people vote or believe the news that they see on the net or on TV. The problem here to Tom is overly reductive thinking: when people reduce themselves to liking certain styles, or genres and keep rationalizing that with 'everybody's taste is different, you can't argue about taste' and that 'this music/band is part of my personality' they deceive themselves in that they think they know what it is they want or seek. At this very moment, Tom felt, a person goes blind. What they perceive to be openness for a style, an artwork, a book, or a music is inversely the closed-mindedness towards everything else. A truer openness is constantly shifting, probing, fluid, and at the same time strong, with integrity. An open aesthetic person makes bad aesthetic judgments and adjusts accordingly. Beauty and truth not as some formula that you know and that is part of your style; but as a wild animal that requires a lot of chasing after, a lot of seeking, a lot of questioning, purifying and readjusting of your methods and strategies. 
559	2	a	For the first time in a long time, Tom felt happy about choosing the Ivesian route or at least he believed his own lie without cynicism. Hollywood and signed bands are for the masses to which he said goodbye and spoke a chant ending in something like: 'I love you guys, but I know better than to open my mouth when you don't want to listen and for this reason my stage, music, creativity is reserved for my loved ones. There is nothing I want nor care to prove to strangers.' To Tom, in his delusional intoxicated state, the mango juice had removed a huge weight and with his mischievous grin he said he was gonna make some serious cash and become as fucked-up as everybody else. His next toast went to Ives.

561	2	a	LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Music Discussion (22), General (1)
562	2	a	"	The way someone would most likely describe me would be ÂHippyÂ. Good, bad, I take is for what it is. I love the Earth, animals, and the sense of deeper and subconscious learning. IÂve had past substance experience with (approximately): "
563	2	a	Mushrooms 25+ times ; Ecstasy 10-12 times ; LSD 8-10 times ; Extensive pharm experience ; Habitual Marijuana use over the last 3 years ; Ether for a few weeks;
564	2	a	GHB 3 times ; DXM 20+ times ; Cocaine 6 or 7 times  ; Salvia twice ; Diphenhydramine once ; 2C-(B or E) ; Morning Glory ; DMT: a resin rip with subtle effects.
565	2	a	Looking for something as inconsistent as LSD can be a deterring factor in the continuation of the search, But when the storm is right and the road to psychedelic enlightenment is paved, you have Bliss and a babyÂs head.
566	2	a	"	ÂYeah man I have a friend who can get that, its ridiculously pure though, so itÂs gonna be $15 a hit.Â ÂOh I see, How about if I buy 10?Â ÂSame thingÂ ..."
567	2	a	After debating, I figured I trusted the kid enough for him to deliver on his word, and after all acid is quite the commodity. After the usual long waiting and anticipation of pre-trip, my friend called, setting a meeting place where we could pick this wonderful magic up.
568	2	a	"	At last, a baggy filled with 10 Sweetarts that set me back 150 big ones. Oh well, I was excited. Before I go into each trip/experience I always give myself a few minutes to reflect on what the upcoming event could hold in store for me, and try to induce mental clarity. At around 10:30pm I ingested the first piece of candy along with 4 other friends. Slightly metallic taste, hoping it was stronger than its taste had suggested. I still felt confident. "
569	2	a	"	I noticed the first effects about 30-45 minutes in, nothing profound or too extreme, just mild color distortion and a slightly fuzzy head. Driving, looking for a place to burn some trees the acid was coming on nicely. Before departing from the car to partake in the sweet embrace of Mary Jane, we each take a second hit. ItÂs about 12:00."
570	2	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
571	2	a	"	On the walk down the dirt path to one of our favorite smoking spots Im struck dead in awe staring at the moon. Watching it as it slowly descends toward the mountains only to watch ascend once more. I pointed out the moon to my friends, and there we all are, stopped dead in our tracks staring. The moon had finally reached all the way to the mountains creating an epic lunar show, where the moonlight would reflect off the mountains in a series of bright patterns. We continued to stare in disbelief of this cosmic event until the moon had completely disappeared behind the mountains."
572	2	a	"	We had eventually made it to the bench to smoke. After we did everything of less-than-bright quality had temporarily gone from my vision. Seeing only an array of streetlights and stars. We got back into the car (not sure the intent of this was, if any) We were driving, bumping music, late at night, on Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, in Utah nonetheless, yet there was this sense that nothing could go wrong, like I was protected from harm and any other terrible event that could befall on me, other than my own psyche I guess. While in the passenger seat of my friends car, I had let out a loud gasp of terror as I clutch my mouth in horror. And pointed at this terrible thing as it lay in the road. Landon (the driver) exclaimed Â You saw it to?!Â "
573	2	a	"	I couldnÂt speak, I was at a total loss for words. My friend had just seen the same morbid, disturbing image I had seen, without knowing that I had even seen it. All I did was nod my head. "
574	2	a	"	It was like heÂd ripped the words from my mouth. As we approached this decapitated infants head, it had turned back into what its true form had been, a brown lunch-bag twisted at the opening to create a spherical bottom with grease stains down the sides, looking like bloodied hair. Such an elaborate trick my mind had played on my vision, it was too real for such a awful image. What I took out of this, is that the immensity and realty of this substance can create structures in the worlds beyond infinity. Its power should not be taking lightly. It is a sacrament."
575	2	a	"	To the park was our destination. Swings! What an idea! Back and forth I go with my face cocked towards the stars zoned out to Floyd(as with most of the night) with a grin bigger than the Cheshire cat. "
576	2	a	"	At a different park (not sure why), my brother comes to buy a sack from my buddy. He comes over talks to me for a bit. Leaves, then I hear him calling back at me with a sort of excitement in his tone. He runs back over to show me some pictures of some newly budding plants heÂd been working on. I must of got the excitement from his vibes. I immediately have this huge smile on my face as he explains his photos. I could feel the light from the phone on my skin, and it was as though the light being reflected on me was exuding from my every pore. With a body high of nothing I have ever felt. "
577	2	a	"	We continued on up into the wilderness section of this park late at night. I remember the lure of a wheat field, I had to go spin in circles with my arms stretched out from my sides, brushing my fingertips against the many plants. My friends got a good chuckle out of this, but it just felt too right not to! "
578	2	a	"	Reaching higher and higher in the park we settle near an old bench. Staring out at the skyline, just staring. And it happened. The line that separated the foliage from the sky and all the colors switched on me. It was almost as if things had gone into ÂNegativeÂ vision. "
579	2	a	"	Still zoning to Floyd, I take a seat on the bench just beginning ÂThe WallÂ. My eyes are closed with my forehead resting on the edge of the table. ÂThe Thin IceÂ comes on the child crying gives me a little scare, and I pop open my eyes as result. Not 2 feet from my face underneath the bench, this hideous child with eyes wide as saucers is staring at me while simultaneously I hear it crying through my headphones. It was there as plain as day. My heart stopped. It was too real not to be."
580	2	a	"	The night continues on at the same park, and in a wide field we all notice a giant pole sticking up from the ground. We all look in wonder, until one of us starts running over to it, with the rest following close behind. Turns out it was a telephone pole (Go figure!). I was barefoot during this whole ordeal (Hippy nature I suppose) as well as most of all last summer. I felt this soothing, soft, almost perfect scratch against my feet. I would pick up handfuls of this sand I was standing on, and just let it slowly drain from my hands. During this repetitive action the thought kept running through my head of there being as many planets in this existence as there are grains of sand on this Earth. Staggering realization when you feel like you can actually put somewhat of a tab on the possibility. "
581	2	a	"	It had become early(5-6am) and the LSD was subsiding. Mostly now was the left-over self-reflection period where youÂre usually are making a lot of conclusions about life and trying to interpret what you had just seen. The bridge back to reality. "
582	2	a	"	We had watched the Lunar light show of the moon dropping behind the mountains, and now here we were watching her counterpart, the sun, bring light and life to the world around us. I had seen the cosmic systems workings for a night. Absolutely stunning. Truly the work of design."
583	2	a	"	We had made our way over to a Harmons(?). I had made the comment while looking at a bushel of roses, that it would be considered quite peculiar for me to go and start smelling all these different flowers. The thought invoked the action, and there I am at 7am smelling the flowers out in front of a grocery store."
584	2	a	"	 It sounds really(10x) corny, but we all need to stop and smell the roses every once in while, and truly take in what has been given to us in this beautiful (mess of a) world."
585	2	a	We cannot grasp existence because we have no means to describe it.
586	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
587	2	a	This was the second and possibly last time i took LSD. I say this because i dont think any other Psychedelic or drug related experiencene could ever top this one.
588	2	a	Me and a few close friends went too an illegal rave in a castle in december, the people there were completely alternative, there where no idiots there trying to sell coke or anything. Obviously there were some insane people there, combining alll sorts of things and getting wasted to the point of no returjn, but there always is.
589	2	a	This wasnt a flaw tho. This njust enhanced the experience for me, it was incredible. WE got there early and had a few drinks, and i brought some salvia and pipe which made a few friends to start with! a couple of my mates took mdma fairly early so me and a few other mates went hunting for acid. Of course i now knpow what people mean when they say that You dont find LSD, LSD finds you. This all seemed alot like someone who had spent too much time on LSD, but it makes sense now.
590	2	a	If you look for it i imagine you'll find it in an uncomfortable place to take it, but if you wait and go somewhere like this, it'll be readily available. Me and my friend took too drops of liquid, which we were told was very weak (we later realised that there is no such thing)
591	2	a	This didnt kick in immediatly so we wwent for another drop which we bought for Â£5. The trip began slowly, and we had a bit of fun. There were typical wall pulses and things, and we had a dance to the awesome psy trance that they were playing. At about 10 o'clock the organisers of the rave brought us a suger cube laced with the stuff, which i was reluctant to take at first, cos i didnt wanna push it. but once my friends had taken it, i felt i wanted to be on the same level as they were.
592	2	a	It was strange at first becaus eit was my mates first experience with psychedelics, or any other drugs for that matter, and i felt i had the responcibility to look after her. So i sat with her in our dorm for alot of the time, talking and walking around, it was perfect, she was fine and we both said alot of things that we needed to say, i was happy here. This was what i wanted from my trip, to really sort out my head cos i was in a bad way with alcoholism, and acid alwys gives you the thinking you need to tackle your problems in the non-psychedelic realm. And it helped her i think too. We bonded that night, we went around the castle grounds and got frightened, inspired, wiser and became better friends for going through this together.
593	2	a	Id taken acid before, but a much lower dose. Which is why i thought i was at my peek at this point,i was wrong :)
594	2	a	When it really began to kick in, it became a little uncomfortable but still, there wasnt enough time to be frightened of this experience, your mind was working too quickly, there was too much to take in at the time. AT the highest point of the trip we went for a dance in the bottom room where they played the harder psychedelic stuff, and this is where i had the most perfect moment:
595	2	a	After dancing for a while i began some sort of ego death, in which i was omnipresent in this room full of otheres who were on the same level as i was, there was no predjudice, just an unconditional brotherhood amongst these people i didnt even speak too, these people id never met, iy was perfect. I felt out of control of myself, and that we were all one in control of eah other. Ive heard of people seeing god on acid, but i felt like i was god. It was perfect.
596	2	a	After this i went to the ambient room, and sat and watched the drapes hanging from the ceiling, covered in paper butterflies which moved there wings gently to the music, it was a perfect moment. The dimensions of the room where beyond comprehension, there was a girl near me juggling or something, my memory betrays me, but it was the most beautiful thing.
597	2	a	We then went back to the dorm, because my mdma taking friends were coming down hard, and so we all sat in the dark listening to pink floyd dark side of the moon. I had some great closed eye visuals here, the visuals just played around the song and held relevancy in them, one part i remember was watching rainbow dollar and pound signs fly by me as the song 'Money' was playing. It was fantastic. Another point i remember was listening to my friends in the bed furthest from me (They are a couple) giggling and laughing with each other, only to realise that it was just the drum beat of the song, and tha id interpreted that in my head that it was the two of them chatting. It just reminded me of how powerfully mind bending LSD is.
598	2	a	I know, this is just another typical trip report, but for me it was perfect. And i conclude that having a bad trip is impossible if you can just find the right place and do it with the right people. And make sure your in the right frame of mind else it could go wrong. But its also an important experience in life, to realise that there are other dimensions that your senses cannot comprehend withot lsd and psychedelics. lsd illegal? The world would be a better place if it wwas compulsary.

600	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Rave / Dance Event (18)
601	2	a	"	We took off at 7pm on a Friday evening. There was me, and the other members of the ExplorerÂs Club, that is S, J, and L. We began our night in my apartment, where our non-partaking roommates had deserted, understanding that there would possibly be four deranged individuals doing Âthe Acid DrugsÂ- probably imagining us shooting pure LSD into our carotid arteries and trying to jump out windows or cut off our hands. Nothing of the sort happened of course, because this is real life, and not an episode of Dragnet."
602	2	a	"	Anyway, Hearing that this was good shit, I had decided to start with one and a half hits,with the other members taking either more or less, depending on their confidence in their ability to hold themselves together. I had attempted to make our setting as pleasant as possible- colored lightbulbs, blacklights, cool artwork, Pink Floyd and Flaming Lips records were prepared. There was also a music visualizer playing on the TV, and we had some bubble-blowing toys and some colored tissue paper to play with."
603	2	a	"	After a while of letting our tabs soak sublingually, and without noticing any strong effects, I was not hesitant about taking another half a hit, taking me now to two hits."
604	2	a	"	Started to feel like something was beginning, so we tore up the colored tissue paper into confetti, and started throwing it at the air conditioner, which would blow it up into the air in a messy Easter-colored tornado. We were beginning to feel that slight squirmy electric feeling crawling all over our beings, when the outside roommates made their way in. They drank some water, and stared on in horror as they saw four young adults writhing around in colored paper shreds on the floor, quoting spongebob, blowing bubbles, and handing them gifts of small fabric pot leaves. "
605	2	a	"	After they left, we began questioning why we donÂt always play with confetti. Why donÂt we always blow bubbles? Or jump in piles of leaves? ... An idea took hold..."
606	2	a	"	Soon, we were out in the cold October night, standing in piles of leaves, which was most satisfactory."
607	2	a	"	Later, we were up on an elevated platform on top of some buildings on our campus. We had gone there expecting to see lights from the buildings pulsating, geometric patterns in the dark sky, and the platform itself stretch out for miles as it had on our previous trips. This trip, it was doing none of those things. I began to wonder if we were even tripping at all. There was just a sense of childish playfulness, not a cosmic awakening as I was half-expecting (again, based off of prior experiments). "
608	2	a	ÂIÂm afraid I might have left the strip out too long- the sun might have diminished itÂs potencyÂ, I said.
609	2	a	ÂI donÂt know... this is kind of nice, like, I donÂt knowÂ, said L.
610	2	a	J said nothing, but chewed on a blade of grass for quite some time.
611	2	a	ÂI have an idea. LetÂs go back to the apartment, take another half a hit each, drink a lot of orange juice, and smoke a lot of pot. We wanted to get high tonight, so lets try to get as high as we canÂ
612	2	a	"	We cut up the remaining two tabs, and took them with some Sunny D rip-off swill that declared itself Â100% Vitamin CÂ. (this brought me now to two and a half hits)"
613	2	a	ÂFlavor be damnedÂ I thought, ÂItÂs those vitamins that will do us goodÂ.
614	2	a	"	So we all took our seats in the bathroom, and pulled out our bong, ÂThe Space-Time ContinuumÂ and proceeded to smoke the most I have ever seen anyone smoke in my entire life. I took no less than seven full rips before we ran out. The room was lit green, and we had some incense burning, as well as The Flaming LipsÂ ÂAt War with the MysticsÂ playing from an iPod dock. By the time ÂFree RadicalsÂ came around, I noticed that in the dark parts of the room, there was color that should not have been there. My mind was projecting imaginary but brilliantly colored lines radiating outwards form the edges of objects in the dark. The ambient psychedelic music blended well, and for a few brief moments, the room seemed to turn into a rainforest, trees beyond my field of vision, exotic animals lurking, and everything gaining a layer of warm tropical moisture."
615	2	a	"	I have no idea how long we spent in there, but at some point we walked out, and sat on the couches of the living room. It was difficult to understand what sort of state we were in. It was like I would change from feeling entirely sober, to really high, to tripping, to tripping and high, then back to sober again."
616	2	a	ÂWhat am I right now?Â We all seemed to be thinking.
617	2	a	And almost as though it heard us, it was like at that moment the acid said:
618	2	a	 ÂYou want to know? You want to know what two and a half hits of acid and an uncountable amount of bong rips is like? Well, here you go, shithead. This is what you bargained for.Â
619	2	a	"	I thought about it a little, then looked at the kitchen. I made my observations and promptly screamed:"
620	2	a	"	ÂLOOK AT THAT SIDE OF THE ROOM! LOOK AT THAT SIDE OF THE ROOM! Yes! We are tripping! Holy Shit!Â"
621	2	a	      I had never been this far gone in my life before, and it was a little unnerving to say the least. The vibrations seemed to be turning on me, I thought. The pink lightbulb cast forth eerie shadows from oddly undulating cabinetry in the kitchen, where i sat, perched precariously on a leaning barstool, spending years slathering Nutella on a slice of one dollar white bread. Though I was not necessarily hungry (Lucy had seen to that), there were certain food rituals I have become accustomed to (thanks to Mary). And perhaps I was just looking for some sort of way to come to terms with and feel some level of control over this insane world which had never made itÂs presence know to me before, at least not to this magnitude. This was especially difficult when I found myself wondering the ulterior motives of my non-partaking roommates: Âare they doing something in secrecy? Is this some sort of jealous and perverse attempt at a one-upping?Â All of this was made worse when Joe began circling the room, dressed nearly all in black, and his  mirrored trip glasses reflecting the green glow of LED Halloween decorative Spider-lights, gave him the appearance of a vulture. ÂThe spirit of judgement!Â I thought, ÂAnd of death!Â, My mind recoiled in fear as I smeared another layer of chocolate-hazelnut spread on my mattress-sized sandwich. I thought, Âthis is LSD. You do NOT fuck around with LSD. Who the fuck do you think you are, taking two and a half hits of this stuff and not expecting THIS to happen? You might have been fucking around before, but weÂre not fucking around nowÂ.
622	2	a	"	Things were really wild. Flat images seemed to be made of a series of floating layers, some of which moved ever so subtly. All objects had some sort of sound, and I was pretty certain I could hear electricity flowing through the strands of electric lights. Time was gone. Logic was gone. Proportion was gone. Distance was gone. No objects were set in place, and they could freely change size if they needed to, and sometimes things would ÂbreatheÂ. Faces and animals were appearing in the pile of confetti, and I felt it was my artistic duty to make the image of a squid eating pink and blue things from these paper shreds. "
623	2	a	"	Even though we as a group could not scrape together much more than the sentiment of ÂWhat are we doing?Â we had decided to take a second exodus outside. Which may or may not have been a good idea- J was headed in a downward spiral. He had fallen very quiet, and I had noticed that he had put his right hand on his face, and had not moved it for perhaps an hour (and he would not move it for the rest of the night). On our long and confusing journey, he would often ask us to slow down, or remark that he was Âunable to get a hold onÂ which dimension his existence was in. We couldnÂt help, seeing as the only thing we could say was ÂWhat are we doing?Â"
624	2	a	"	So we returned to our apartment again, and sat amidst the now wrinkled and sad confetti bits with our minds absolutely blown to bits. My mind was a blank slate, and I couldn't think of a damn thing to say. But  this whole trip was like a metaphor for life: starting off fun and playful (childhood), moved on to exploration of the world (teenage years), then violently thrust into a strange world, with no other options but wander around wondering what we were going to do next (adulthood), until we got tired and wrinkled and eventually fell asleep (death)."
625	2	a	Overall, it was a cool experience, but I would have appreciated a bit more of a come-up, and the ability to reflect afterwards.

627	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Small Group (2-9) (17)
628	2	a	The setting was a very large psytrance festival in Europe. Nearly 30,000 brave souls had gathered for 5 days in a beautiful setting on the shores of a lake. The festival featured a huge psychedelic temple, fire dancers from four continents, amazing multi-story light shows and art instillations, lazers that bounced off the clouds, and a troupe of stilt walkers with extremely intricate costumes who I made friends with the very first night. For four days and nights I had been partying hard. In the previous 48 hours I had consumed mushrooms, LSD, peyote, MDMA, MDA, 2CI, 2Cb, 2CT7, 5-meo-DMT, and Ayahuasca (the Ayahuasca wasn't that strong, everything else was stronger than I had ever had). 
629	2	a	For the final night of the party I had decided to eat a ten strip of Albert Hofmann blotter that I had been saving. I remember dancing. I remember the lights. The sound of fire spinning around. The smell of the earth itself as thousands stomped the ground, raising a cloud of dust. At some point (I think it was around midnight) I asked a guy on the dance floor next to me if I could have a drink out of his water bottle. He told me to help myself, that it was in his bag that was sitting under the speaker next to us. I found it and took a very long hard swig, planning on refilling it for him at one of the water spigots that were set up. Just as I was about to finish chugging his water, he ran up and grabbed my arm, asking me 'does that water bottle have a black line drawn on it'? I looked at it and told him it did. This is when he began a low maniacal laugh that I will remember for the rest of my life. I asked with some trepidation what was in the bottle. His answer: 'Man, I hope you like LSD and speed!'
630	2	a	This in itself would have been fine, but the 10 strip was just kicking in, and I knew I was in for a bit of a ride. The next couple of hours were a bit of a blur. I remember trying to get a bottle of water at one of the bars and trying to jump over the bar. The guy running it was extremely patient with me. I think. Sometime later that evening I ended up sitting on a speaker box as the beat tore through me. BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM at 138 beats a minute was rattling my soul. The world was an infinite latticework of energy, my consciousness a tiny node on a psychedelic shimmering net that stretched from alpha to omega. Time and space itself were my playthings. I could look at some person dancing on the other side of the dance floor and with the mere will for it to be, I could see into their souls. It was too much to keep my eyes open, so I lowered my head into my lap and began to watch the light show inside.
631	2	a	It was at this point that my stilt walker friends must have seen me, sitting on a speaker with my head in my lap, rocking gently back and forth, and known EXACTLY what was going on. The came up to me and formed a semi-circle around me. With stilts on their hands and feet. In gorilla costumes. With grunting speaker boxes hidden on their chests.
632	2	a	I opened my eyes and looked up. Directly in front of me were a half a dozen gorillas grunting with great apparent concern for my wellbeing. Behind them were thousands of people dancing under a huge psychedelic temple to pounding music. One of these two things could not be happening. I had to make a choice.
633	2	a	After a few seconds my gestalt shifted. My world view changed. Finally, I realized what was going on. Clearly I was on drugs. I must have eaten something funny. My pack was concerned for me. Oh, did I mention that I must be a tripping gorilla who had hallucinated the entire human race? I got down of the speaker box and left the dance floor. I climbed the hill behind the temple to have a better vantage point, and for at least the next couple of hours I sat their, watching the dance floor pulsing, marveling at the ability of my ape brain to create such a complex hallucination as mankind. It wasn't until just before sunrise that my peak subsided, and I realized what had been going on. It was, to this day, the most intense trip and comedown I have ever experienced. I wouldn't trade it for the world.

635	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Festival / Lg. Crowd (24)
636	2	a	The following is a recall of last Saturday.  Me and a friend did an experiment involving marijuana, LSD(acid), at Cedar Point.
637	2	a	A vibration pounds on the side of my mattress, ripping me from my peaceful sleep. C calls and wakes me up.  Today is the day we do the adventure to Cedar Point on acid.
638	2	a	I get to D's house to pick up C and S.  S hands me a large bag of marijuana and gives me the box of blunts I forgot to take home the last night.  I understand without being told and split a blunt, empty the tobacco and refill it with marijuana. We then stop at the gas station to stock up on food (Doritos) and Drink (Dr. Pepper).  C steals S's spot in the front seat.
639	2	a	I have now been driving on the highway for about fifteen minutes.  Spencer pulls out the blunt I rolled earlier and we smoke it.  The blunt hits very harsh, there is more paper than marijuana and I'm slightly disappointed.  The blunt gets me pretty high nevertheless and the drive becomes much more enjoyable.  I even turn up the music and giggle a little bit.  I feel very excited and hopeful about the day that's about to happen.
640	2	a	In the past half hour we have gotten on a toll road and started to roll more blunts.  I decide that since I am driving I should let C roll the blunt because it's his weed and even though I've never really seen him roll a blunt, I figure he can do it because he rolls good joints.  The blunt he rolls is very odd looking and not very pleasant but it's definitely smokeable.  
641	2	a	I have my own weed and a very strong desire to have a good blunt available while at cedar point so I tell C to take the wheel and roll a very decent blunt that will hit good, stay tight, and even a nice little mouthpiece.  After we finish rolling the blunts we have a large open space to finish driving to ohio, about 40 minutes if I had to guess.  We have a bowl and marijuana but me and C agree that bowls will ruin the very nice blunt high we have going right now and decide not to smoke bowls until after the day is over.
642	2	a	We are about 15 miles away from our exit and the end of this terrible toll road.  This road makes you stop and get tickets then stop and pay money.  It confuses me and angers me as I've never been on a toll road before.  Since the driving portion is almost over me and C drop our acid.  He takes 2 and I take one because I'm driving.  S has no acid to take because he thought it would be a bad idea and took his the night before.
643	2	a	We come to the toll road and the woman asks for $4.75.  I check to make sure she meant four dollars, then continue on towards cedar point, pissed off that I had to pay to drive.  Why do I have to pay money to pay attention, keep my car from going off the road, and not hit anything?  I think that I should be getting paid for doing it successfully.  The world doesn't make sense I decide.
644	2	a	"We have finally made it to cedar point and we are now waiting in line.  I can feel the beginning effects of the acid kick in.  S tells me that it took a long time for it to fully kick in for him, 90 minutes as he described it.  I don't believe him at the time, but I would soon find out he was right.	I see a man walking around and talking to random people and wanting to know whats going on I ask him what he's doing.  He tells me this crazy story which I couldn't follow and then offers me 2 tickets for 25 dollars each.  I think wow that sounds good, they are 42 at the gate.  	'Do they work' I ask him."
645	2	a	Needing no further explanation Me and S buy the tickets.  I could tell that C was hoping he would get them and realizes he still has to pay 42 dollars.  His acid must be affecting him because he didn't give the man any money and he still tried to grab at the tickets. After walking in the gates C chews up the map and we are lost for the rest of the day.
646	2	a	We have now journeyed to the first ride of the day, the power tower, because of the small wait.  While standing in line I break two more hits of acid off the strip, giving one to C and taking one myself bringing my dose to 2 and his to 3.  I knew that it hadn't been an hour and a half and my acid hasn't even started really kicking in yet but I figure if it's taking this long it must not be very strong acid.
647	2	a	"Standing in line is fine right now, killing time is easy by just talking to C and S and taking in the scenery.  I feel very happy and still excited about the day.  I remember saying	'I knew this was a good idea'."
648	2	a	Finally we are loading onto the ride.  The first hit of acid has gotten much stronger in the last ten minutes and as C begins to sit where I can't see him I protest and make him switch seats so that I'm sitting next to people I know.  We all take our shoes off and wait to be shot upward hundreds of feet.  It happens.  Going straight up that fast really confused me and I felt a huge adrenaline rush go through my body.  This felt different than anything I've ever done, but it filled me with happiness and energy and I ran from the ride sliding down the railing wanting to go ride more rides.  S was not tripping acid though and wanted to go to the beach to smoke one of the blunts that we rolled.  I couldn't argue that.
649	2	a	It has been a long walk ever since the power tower and we are just now passing the Corkscrew.  Exhausted and confused I tell S and C that we have to ride the corkscrew right now while the line is short.  The wait is perfectly fine with me still, just me hanging out with my friends, talking about stuff.  The ride is pretty fun, but nothing mind blowing.  The acid still isn't causing any obvious visuals, or audio distortions.  The acid is making me think different and enhancing my mood, but anything else was still very subtle.
650	2	a	The acid is getting stronger by the minute and I warmly accept it.  I am really completely fearless right now and willing to do anything.  We stamp our hands at the cedar point gate and walk along the sidewalk near the beach.  Suddenly I decide I want to be different from everyone else and jump the fence separating us from the sand.  I step back and with little warning run, jump, climb the fence, jump, and fall.  And fall.  Turns out there was a very big drop off from the sidewalk to the sand.  I collapse as soon as I hit the ground and roll onto my stomach. Luckily the sand doesn't hurt me and my friends follow.
651	2	a	After walking through the sand as far away from the park as we could get without getting wet, we light up the blunt and hope that a cop doesn't walk by.  People are everywhere and I kind of worry but I go for it anyways.  Maybe we can burry the blunt before anyone gets here and run for it.  Hitting the blunt makes me feel very different after the very first hit.  Everything seems so crazy all of the sudden.  I start telling my two friends how marijuana is such a big part of my life, even though they know that more than almost anyone.  I start to realize that ever since I took the acid I haven't felt the marijuana high very much at all, the acid was completely taking over the feelings of dumb happiness and making me think very rapidly.
652	2	a	Before taking my second hit I look over to the Lake.  (Or ocean I'm not really sure what it was, it was a large body of water).  The water goes all the way out to the horizon and merges with the blue sky, and I notice how incredible the clouds are.  I inform my friends that the clouds are moving, and I am just astounded.  I start walking towards the horizon, not knowing what it is I want to accomplish, only knowing that I want to be as close to this amazing spectacle as I can.  Before I step into the lake completely clothed my friends drag me back.  I turn to C and say guess what.  I hit the blunt and suddenly he remembers that were smoking a blunt in public and his eyes get very wide and he holds out his hand to take his turn.
653	2	a	After a while C becomes exhausted from walking through sand and sits down with the blunt.  S tells us that we are sitting right next to a path and we are only separated by the hill we are sitting behind.  The blunt is getting very small and I don't think it would be worth it to try to get C to stand up in his state of mind.  S walks off with the blunt and I chase him down and get it back.  I convince him to wait until we can get C up and we finish the blunt as C gathers his items and works his way to his feet.
654	2	a	I sit and gaze at my surroundings.  The acid has completely kicked in and I am tripping out of my mind.  I love the beach and want to continue sitting here for the rest of my life.  I stare at the seagulls and I see a small patch of land a little past the tide.  I run towards the water and jump landing right on the patch of land and scaring hundreds of seagulls away.  I'm sad that I scared so many lives away and negatively impacted them, but happy that I am completely surrounded by water.  It's a very peaceful feeling.  Suddenly S informs us that we have been at the beach too long and I begin to panic.  Do people know we're on drugs?  Is anyone going to tell on us?  Am I going to go to prison and be stuck in Ohio?  Terrible things start affecting my brain and the only thing I can do is ask S what we can do to fix everything.  He says we have to go back to the part and starts walking away from the beach.
655	2	a	'Wait!' I tell him 'I'm not ready to leave.'  S and C both leave and I am stuck either chasing them down or staying at the beach alone.  I chase down C and ask him why we have to leave.  S continues walking.  C gets confused and suddenly tells me that the sand shatters when you walk on it.  I look down and he was correct.  Every step we took caused the sand to create strange patterns all around us.  Seeing me have such a big impact just by walking was an incredible feeling and we started walking around very slowly watching the sand make patterns.
656	2	a	I realized that S was no longer with us and looked up to see if I saw him.  As soon as I looked up I saw the clouds and there were rainbows everywhere in the sky.  My vision was made up of a bunch of colored diamonds that were shrinking and enlarging rapidly.  I started to hear noises from people in the park.  I could hear everyone who was in about a quarter mile range and all the voices were echoed and distorted so I couldn't make out what they were saying but it started to scare me.  I begin to worry that this could be a bad trip.  I ask C if he wants to stay at the beach with me and he's confused and says we can't waste this trip by staying at the beach.  I agree for some reason and we make our way to the sidewalk.
657	2	a	Walking through the sand is now a very unpleasant feeling and suddenly I am seeing everything repeat itself in time.  I am watching myself do things that I have already done yet everything else continues on.  This worries me because I can't change my actions and everyone else can.  As suddenly as this wild feeling of deja vu kicked it, it suddenly left me as though it never happened.
658	2	a	Note:  I will do the best I can to remember the times of the following events, but at this point I was afraid to hold my phone because I thought I would break it so I stopped checking the time for about an hour.
659	2	a	Me and C have now made it back to the sidewalk and we sit down at a bench.  I am way messed up now and the acid is still getting more and more intense.  I wonder how C is doing because he took a hit more than me.  We decide that I should lead until we find S.  I try to call S and when I talk to him he sounds very confused and can't tell me where he is.  I hang up because I'm frustrated.  We try to call back and he doesn't pick up so we walk back into the park.
660	2	a	We are now wandering around completely helpless around Cedar Point hallucinating, disoriented, lost, and un-functional.  C suggests we ride a ride and I tell him we need to find S.  I try to explain that we just took someone from a different state and dropped him off at an amusement park.  C doesn't seem to grasp the idea and continues suggesting we just ride rides and don't worry about it.
661	2	a	I give up looking for S.  We walk into the entrance closest to us and get ready to ride a ride.  I walk through the metal thing that turns and get in line.  Suddenly I realize how long this line is and how long we have to wait.  I feel like everyone in line is staring at me.  I freak out and without saying a word to C I push about 6 people out of my way and squeeze through the metal thing and continue walking.  I realize a few people had shouted at me and suddenly consider the thought that other people have feelings too.  Up until this point I had completely forgotten the concept of the human being except for C and S.
662	2	a	I apologize to C for causing such an embarrassing scene.  It wasn't that I was afraid or anything, I just never considered the fact that other people wouldn't want to be pushed.  I could easily have stayed in line, I just didn't want to stay there that long with everyone staying with me, and it seemed perfectly logical to do what I wanted.  C asks where we are going and I say I don't know, maybe we should look for S.  He tells me that it's S's fault for getting lost and we should ride rides.  We see the corkscrew for the second time and I decide that this is the perfect opportunity to gauge how the acid effects the ride.
663	2	a	In what felt like hours of waiting (actually 20 minutes), Me and C finally made it to the front of the line.  A woman turned to me and asked if I wanted to go before her daughters so she could go at the same time as them.  This made me extremely happy and very thankful for the woman's kindness.  Minutes were taking eternities to pass and even knowing that we will get to ride a minute or two sooner than we would have originally was plenty to make me overwhelmingly happy.  After thanking the woman me and C stepped up to the gate where we waiting to be seated.  I noticed how the 3 men running the ride all had microphones and were talking to each other trying to crack jokes.  I noted how bizzare the human race is that we actually need to hire people to keep patrons entertained because the park is too boring otherwise.  This was a turning point in the trip and I started thinking about the people that own Cedar Point and how they are treating human beings like they don't have emotions or thoughts.
664	2	a	The man begins giving instructions after we are seated in the large metal contraption.  He says we have to fasten our seat belts and after fumbling around for a minute or two I finally figured it out.  C remained completely oblivious to all instructions.  A man came up to C and said please fasten your seat belt and pull on it.  C said nothing and continued staring forward in a stupor.  Confused the man just ignored C and cleared us to go.  C looks over me and says 'Oh, were we supposed to do something?'  
665	2	a	'Dude, think of how smart the guy who owns this place must be' I reply 'He convinces people from all over the world to pay money just to enter this giant park, then makes you wait in lines to be put into a quick ride.  People from all over the world.  Wow I just realized how insignificant we are compared to all of this.  Even if people do know we're on acid it's not going to matter because they all have better stuff to do than tell on us.'  I began seeing the world through other people's eyes and realize that in their eyes I am a nobody.  Suddenly my body is hurled up then I'm thrown into a loop.  The roller coaster seems to be moving extremely slow and all the sudden I just got really happy.  I start laughing uncontrollably.  The roller coaster does a corkscrew and while we are upside down I feel like I could just fly away.  The ride stops suddenly and I am very disappointed, wanting the ride to keep going.
666	2	a	We exit the ride and begin wandering around the park again.  At this point Spencer has called me multiple times but I stopped using my phone because I thought I would break it so it stays in my pocket.  The first thing I remember coming to as we left the corkscrew was a railroad with the gates down.  On both sides of the railroad tracks are huge packs of people, each wanting to go in the other direction.  As soon as the gates go up everyone pushes forward, me and C follow not wanting to stand out.  Everyone looks very sorry and hurried as we push through the bodies.  I see a woman pushing a stroller through the massive pack of people who looks very scared.  I feel sorry for her and want to stop pushing and just let everyone pass through me, but I know I will cause a scene if I do anything and just continue shoving.  This also pushed my trip in the wrong direction, making me feel like a terrible person, and making me hate Cedar Point even more.
667	2	a	At this point we are near familiar features such as the fountain and the arcade room.  C suggests we go play video games to try to calm our minds down.  Willing to believe anything to gain a bit of sanity I follow him in.  The instant I set foot in the arcade I knew it was a terrible idea.  Flashing colors were everywhere, and millions and millions of computerized sounds echoing off the walls, all merging together and creating one very strange and unpleasant hum.  I knew there were people in the arcade but I couldn't distinguish any bodies, I could just hear the voices echoing in my mind.  The first game that has a seat I plop down and stare at the screen in front of me.  I feel very awkward sitting inside the tiny car video game, but I feel that it's too late to change my mind.  I find quarters and put them in the machine.  C helps me start the game but soon he is playing a game of his own and I am left to figure out on my own.  I sit and stare like a retard until the game starts on its own.  I realize that I have to drive a car and press the pedal.  I'm moving but moving extremely slow.  The colors on the video game look extremely unrealistic and they start swaying and bubbling.  After about two minutes of staring like a retard I put the car into second gear.  I like going fast.  I start laughing very loudly but I can't stop playing the game because I haven't finished yet.  After about 10 minutes of me and C laughing hysterically playing a racing game we stumble out of the arcade and finally agree to look for S.
668	2	a	After sitting in one place for about 5 minutes (It seemed like hours, we even got up for almost a minute then remembered we were supposed to stay) S was able to locate us.  I'm happy we finally have found S and I ask him if he would like to ride some rides.  S seems disconnected from the world I'm in and I realize that communication is impossible.
669	2	a	Waiting in line for the 3d dissapator or something, suddenly I'm given new hope for Cedar Point.  I realize that we have already rode a few rides and done a lot of drugs.  I would rather have ridden more rides but maybe people will go home and we will have the park to ourselves I think.  Once we get inside the building waiting in line isn't such a chore anymore.  Before now, me and C were completely silent in the lines and just stared at each other to make sure if anyone was staring at us, at least we wouldn't be staring back because that's how I got myself into trouble on the ferris wheel.  The acid had me very paranoid and I had to gather myself each time before getting very close to people (like waiting in line).
670	2	a	The indoor section of the line was very dark lit and had a lot of bright colors and 3d effects everywhere.  It was very pleasant but my visuals had stopped and it was nothing too insane. After the line moved forward a bit there was a green substance splattered on the wall that appeared to be crawling.  I asked S if the green thing looked like it was moving around to him and a few people gave me sketchy looks.  I smiled to myself.
671	2	a	The ride itself was cool, but it was very dark lit and no strange visuals occurred.  The ride was fun, and probably scared me more than normal, but now the effects of the acid were mainly mental.
672	2	a	"Me, S, and C have now all made our way back to the beach where we this time walk to a very secluded area to smoke another blunt.  After the 3d ride we got lockers and put our hoodies away.  At this point my jean pockets are extremely full and I am feeling very overwhelmed wanting to get my hoody back as soon as possible.  After smoking the blunt that C rolled earlier in the car I am unsatisfied and want a nice blunt to smoke.  C finds a new map lying in the sand and hands it to me in attempt to redeem himself for earlier.  I use the map as a tray and roll a blunt.  I then fold up the remaining pot inside the map, not realizing that I could have used it to find my way to rides. 	We smoke the second blunt and this time feel much more paranoid.  Many people are staring at us and this time I don't feel happy.  The sky is starting to get darker and a mood of sadness sets into the park."
673	2	a	We walk back from the beach to the park.  We instantly go back and get our hoodies because of the freezing temperature.  After wandering for over an hour I vow to get in the next line I see.  After I get in line I change my mind and jump over the railing and we continue walking.  We have now reached the exit and getting angry I shout 'I didn't come here to walk, I came to ride rides!'  S leads us to the demon drop.  Suddenly I have intense flashbacks to when I was 8 years old and here with my parents.  
674	2	a	Almost a decade ago,  I remember getting on the demon drop.  The demon drop is a ride where you are sat in a large steel box.  The steel box is raised a hundred feet or so into the air and then you do a bar guided free fall.  As the box reached the peak and started moving forward to begin the plunge I immediately freaked out and started screaming.  'Wait stop the ride I don't want to do this!' Instantly the ride dropped and I felt like my body was being split in two.  I came back a few years after that incident and rode the ride just to prove that I was a big boy.
675	2	a	Anyways now I was back, and I started describing my past life to C.  I have a very strange past life as I used to live in a different state and moved when I was 10.  I was always open minded, but I had a complete different personality for half of my life.  Anyways I could tell I was freaking C out by telling him this while he was on acid so I just stopped and waited in silence.  After being seated on the ride C tells me to put my feet against the steel in front of us.  The man running the ride comes over and tells us to keep our feet off of it.  I am instantly angered.  Does he think I'm going to break the steel box?  Does Cedar Point treat all of their customers like that?  Before I can  protest the ride begins and our box starts its ascent.  Not at all wanting to ride the ride I once again think of my 8 year old self.  As the box begins moving forward I feel exactly as I did 9 years ago and It feels like my body is being ripped apart as we drop from the giant metal tower.  After the ride my heart is pounding and  I feel very excited once again.
676	2	a	We have wondered around the park looking for rides with lines less than 2 hours long and have been completely unsuccessful.  Once we ended up going into a room filled with fog and no light.  There were strange people coming up to us and trying to scare us, and it was working.  After leaving that part of the park all I can do is complain that we had to walk through a ride.  Giving up we decide to leave the park.  Only problem is I'm still tripping and can't drive yet.  I know that I won't be sober in time for the park to close but I know that waiting an hour or two will help a lot.  Willing to do anything to kill time we wait in line for the ferris wheel.
677	2	a	We have boarded the ferris wheel and it is interesting gazing at the parking lot. It's crazy how this many people will all come to one place to wait in lines.  It feels like I've been at Cedar Point all my life and I'm ready to leave it behind forever.  I tell my friends my decision to never return to Cedar Point and C for the time being agrees.  I start explaining what my day has been like and C tells me we need to stop talking until the acid wears off.  We have been talking about everything for the entire day and it seems logical to take a break.  At the moment I can't even describe how my day went, and just accept the silence.
678	2	a	The day is finally over I tell myself as I sit down in my car.  C breaks out a bag of chips and a 2 liter of Dr. Pepper.  I completely forgot about them and I start laughing.  I'm having much more fun in my car than I had at cedar point the past couple hours.  S immediately passes out in the back seat.  He didn't sleep the night before because he was up doing the acid that we were supposed to do at Cedar Point.
679	2	a	I have not yet put the key in the ignition and C points this out.  'Oh I just wasn't going to drive until someone made me' I reply. 'Drive' commands C.  I drive.  Confused I tell C that its his job to tell me exactly when and where to turn for the entire drive back home.  With much difficulty and confusion we exit the Cedar Point Parking lot.  I have almost no visuals anymore and just have a strange head buzz that makes me feel somehow 'different' but not very messed up.
680	2	a	C asks me if I'm going to stop at a gas station soon.  I ask him why I would do that when he told me he didn't want to go to one. 'Oh I meant I did want to go to one' he replies.  I see a sign that says 'Last stop in ohio!' I tell C he's in luck. It's pretty large store for being a gas station on the side of the highway and I'm pretty impressed.  As soon as I walk in I see a coffee mug with a red bird and the word 'Ohio'.  I know that this cup has chosen me and I bring it to the checkout.  C orders a pizza and a Coffee.  I then order the coffee with the longest name and it turns out to be a delicious frappachino.
681	2	a	After receiving our merchandise we successfully drove home and went to J's place to sleep.  Arriving at about 1 in the morning we immediately tried going to sleep.  Me and C still had acid in our systems and stayed up playing Super Smash bros. Meelee  until 2 am when he passed out.  I didn't fall asleep until 4 am. The next day my legs felt like they had been run over.
682	2	a	The entire day C wanted to get food but every time we saw the line we changed our mind.  On acid we couldn't convince ourselves to spend that much time doing nothing.  We ate out of vending machines the entire day.
683	2	a	Me and C only separated once for about 5 seconds when he left me at a drinking fountain.  He told me that everyone started moving really fast when he couldn't find me.
684	2	a	Stay away from mirrors.  They mess with your head.
685	2	a	All in all I have to say that it was a good experience.   I would never do it again purely because standing around doing nothing is boring and being on acid makes it even more intensely boring.  This is definitely the hardest I have ever tripped in my life and it has possibly changed a few things about my thinking.  I don't think I would really recommend this trip for anyone, as if I would've freaked out at all I think I would have gone insane.  We really weren't expecting the acid to be any good so we really just dosed to fast, so if you think you could pull it off go for it, but be careful.  Give your acid plenty of time to kick in.

687	2	a	Abt. 11a.m.: A not quite euphoric high begins to build, w/ slight anxiety
688	2	a	Abt. 12p.m.: Rising high stalls and almost disappears until 1p.m.
689	2	a	Abt.2p.m.: Heavy 'stoned' feeling sets in w/o usual psychedelic character. More a narcotic, opiate-like stoned, only slightly trippy. Not dysphoric but not esp. 'happy' and lightheaded like LSD is (for anon.).
690	2	a	Abt. 3 p.m.: Peak. Kind of an LSA/alcohol type inebriation, w/o LSA nausea. Neither deeply meditative or fun, rather boring really. No visuals aside from subtle color variations and waving (but not exactly) effect on objects.
691	2	a	3-5 p.m.: Pretty even plateau. Gradual drop off until sometime after 12 a.m. Slept poorly. 
692	2	a	Conclusion: CERTAINLY not LSD. A wild guess it was some RC, a phen maybe, tho. based on reading only, anon has no exp. aside from mesc. The blotter was unperforated and an off white color...anon pitched remaining blotter.

694	2	a	LSD (2), Unknown (120) : What Was in That? (26), General (1), Unknown Context (20)
695	2	a	This/Last (today is Sunday that I am typing this) Friday I had the fun experience of trying acid once again. I was hanging out with my usual friends, and my parents were out of town for the entire weekend so I had planned to have a small group of friends come over and smoke pot, snort cocaine, and drink. Well I got news that we could get acid, a guy had 20 hits of blotter paper, so we went out and bought the entire sheet. I bought 2 hits of acid for 10$. I was kind of had a pessimistic outlook on it, because I had been ripped off before. But this acid was real, *very* real. I am very glad that I had not started out with 4 hits, as that would have been way to much for me - even 2 hits was a very visual, intense trip. Here's how it went.
696	2	a	At around 9:30 I took the acid, left it on my tongue for a while, flipped sides, then eventually chewed it up and swallowed it. All my other friends took the acid at various times. All of them took 2 hits, except one person who took 6 hits (a more experienced tripper). When we got to my house, I just got ready to trip. I turned on my black light, and put on some Pink Floyd. 30 minutes or so later, after smoking a joint outside, things started to happen. I went inside and looked on my computer screen, my desktop picture (of the moon, starts, and nebula) was moving - as if it was a screensaver. It seemed as if the picture had different 'layers' to it, and each layer was moving a different way. The sun in the picture made me squint, even though it was not real - as if the picture was real!
697	2	a	Things started getting crazier and crazier every minute. We experienced some confusion as to what was going on since everybody in my house was tripping - rather funny, we could not stop laughing not matter what we did. A little ways later, I went into my room alone when everybody else was in the living room, laid down in my dark lighted room with Pink Floyd playing and stared at my scenic pictures on the wall. All of a sudden everything round the pictures disappeared and turned into black space, and the pictures seem to be '3D'. The frames of the pictures turned into fluorescent rainbow colors, and seemed to stick out, as if I could touch the back of the pictures on the wall. Truly an amazing sight. For no apparent reason I started laughing out loud, in my room, alone. The music sounded *amazing*, Pink Floyd was truly made for tripping. Totally euphoric.
698	2	a	I then went to talk to my other friends. The guy who took 6 hits was totally out of it. He was going nuts, in a good way. All the wall paper on my walls, and just about every surface was either breathing or moving in some sort of weird way. We were outside for a bit when it started raining, and that felt very good. I could go on countless hours about the visuals I saw, which were so amazing, but I won't. I called a sober friend of mine, just to see what she would sound like while I am tripping. That kind of kept me in a 'peaceful' state of mind since I knew that everything was not going crazy, and that I will still come down when it is over which kept me in a good mood. She stayed on the phone for nearly 4 hours with me, listening to me babble on, even putting the phone down for 20 minutes straight at 3:00 in the morning! That is truly a good friend, as I know I was probably scaring her with everything I said, but she enjoyed talking to me while I was tripping and I did too.
699	2	a	I peaked and did some just plain weird things. I hid in my closet with the lights off for no apparent reason, then scared the living shit out of one of my friends who walked into my room alone when I jumped out, he screamed and nearly freaked out. Later, after we came down a little bit, me and a friend went outside and wrote 'trip' in shaving cream on a friends wind shield just to do something. The trip was amazing, highly visual, and euphoric - but the next day was horrible. I felt like I was 'out of it' the entire day. Probably because I got no sleep, and smoked a bunch of pot all throughout the next day. I was afraid to even talk to my parents on the phone because I would stumble on every word, but alas everything turned out fine when I woke up Sunday at a friends house and was totally fine and feeling good. I would repeat that any time, just maybe during the day next time, a little earlier, so I will be down at night time and be able to sleep at my normal weekend sleeping times so I would wake up in the morning actually feeling normal enough to talk to authority if I needed to.
700	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
701	2	a	It was my first LSD trip in a year. I had two sugarcubes, each one imbibed with two drops of some reportedly strong liquid LSD. My plan: to take them in my mom and stepdad's apartment while they were at work and be coming down by the time they got home.
702	2	a	I woke up at 11:00 AM on a Saturday. Got up, got dressed, meditated for about a half hour, turned down the lights, burned some incense and candles to set a contemplative mood. Finally, I crunched the cubes down and put on some music: The Grateful Dead's 'Infared Roses'.
703	2	a	About a half hour later I could feel the acid coming on. I decided to put on some more uptempo music so I popped in 'Demetertainment', a Twisted Records psytrance compilation. Beast - 'Spawn' was sounding a might fucking nice! ;) The acid was coming on and I kept repeating to myself: 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - as I felt my mindstate elevating.
704	2	a	The music was playing and I was grooving around my living room and noticing that this was indeed some strong LSD. Mind manifesting indeed! I felt like I was walking around in my mind. I felt some kind of weird aura around my body, maybe just a heightened awareness of the somatic energies in my body. I don't know but I felt something.
705	2	a	I started looking at some Sandman comic book called 'Dream Hunters' and was marvelling at this Japanese artist's watercolor/hand-drawn art in it and then I turned on my laptop and started playing around with that Fractint program for a bit (the whole trip I was seeing MAD fractals every time I closed my eyes. Fractal OD!) I started reading some stuff I'd written that was on my computer and was disappointed I hadn't finished one of my longer poems, but reading it was fun because I didn't remember any of it. It was as if someone else had  written it and I was reading it for the first time. Shortly after this I had a phrase come into my head.....my quote of the day: 'The universe loves AHA's!'
706	2	a	I then started to look at some of the art my friend had done on this comic book project we were collaborating on and it looked amazing in my heightened state and I started wondering why the fuck we aren't rich bastards yet so I decided to page him to urge him to get to work, but his pager number had changed and I kept getting the wrong number. I called his house and his dad told me he'd moved out (he just got a new apartment) but he didn't have his new phone number yet, he did, however, give me a new pager number....but I wrote it down wrong!!! I just kept getting wrong number tones. It was imperative that I talked to my friend at this point. I took it as a bad omen that I couldn't page him or talk to him.
707	2	a	I had planned on not leaving the apartment because I have some annoyingly nosey neighbors in my apartment complex which made me nervous, but I had to go outside to see what it looked like. It was a beautiful day, sunshiny with not a cloud in the sky. I saw my landlord J*** and decided to say hi to him (I was on the 3rd floor balcony and he was down in this little courtyard on the ground floor cleaning a barbeque grill) I said hello, but he didn't hear me. I kept saying hello but he still didn't hear me (he's an old guy) and for some reason I thought something might be wrong with him the way he was standing there so I thought I'd go down and talk to him to see if he was okay. There goes my plan of not leaving my apartment.
708	2	a	So, I go down and there's my landlord and I say 'Hi there, nice day isn't it?' and he gives me this little elderly grin and a nod and says 'Oh yeah, 80 degrees, perfect day.' Very, very prophetic words, I felt. We both looked up into the sky, admiring the day. It was a moment. So, anyways, there I was talking to the landlord tripping balls on acid and I realized I was still holding the cordless phone from when I was trying to page my friend, which must have made me look weird. I then walked out to the front of my apartments (it is a gated apartment complex with one entrance in the front) and I went outside the gate (another violation of my plan to not leave my apartment, an unwise move) and I went and sat down on the steps in the front and just was checking out the trees and plants and stuff. I tried to go back in and realized I had Forgotten My Key! D'oh! I was locked out. I tried to go around but, being as it was a gated community, there was no way inside. I tried to get the attention of the landlord but he had left the courtyard. I saw a guy walk past me on the sidewalk and he looked sinister...I thought he was evil for some reason, but didn't really feel threatened by him, I just got bad vibes. He looked at me oddly and I just said hello and gave what, to him, must have been a weird looking smile. I was still holding the cordless phone, I noticed, so I put it in my pocket (I have big pockets.)
709	2	a	Finally, one of my neighbors let me back in the gate and I went in my apartment once more. I was glad to be back. I wasn't going to leave again. It was a bad idea in the first place, especially since I was alone. I put on some music, this time a progressive trance mixtape by a DJ named Brad called 'Mother Earth Sound System' (very good trip music I would say.) I kept getting these dehydration type feelings so I drank a big glass of water and felt good instantly. Every cell in my body celebrating my ingestion of good old H2O.
710	2	a	This is when my trip started to get weird. I was laying on my sofa and just zoning out. Zonked, if you will. I still haven't sorted out everything I was thinking but it had something to do with how every machination of my consciousness was a lie somehow and that at every thought, and impulse of thought, I was leading myself astray from my 'normal reality'. I was being given 'messages' in my head that everything is infinite and every thing is connected to it's opposite and that everything WAS it's opposite because everything taken to it's extreme had the potential to become it's opposite, which, in hindsight, was some pretty basic yin-yang type stuff.
711	2	a	Time was totally out of whack. I did an experiment to see how long it felt like a minute passed and I looked the clock and counted to 60 and it seemed like I was counting forever. I kept getting these weird linguistic babblings in my head (I always experience this on upper doses of LSD and it actually kind of bugs me) it's like unpronounceable sentences revolving in my brain. I figured it was some kind of distortion in the way my brain was processing language so I took the time to say the alphabet a few times to make sure I still had my language faculties. I did! Whew! No brain damage for me! (?)
712	2	a	I started zoning out some more and just felt totally weird. I was thinking some very far out shit like, because I was thinking certain ways and certain things (things I can't exactly remember), the day would not end. Night would never come and it would be perpetual day forever. Time lagged on and seemed to reaffirm this notion. I somehow managed to remember that my mom and step-dad were supposed to be coming home and if they DIDN'T come home as expected and day DIDN'T end, then I would have something to worry about...until then I would just not worry about it. I also was thinking about some of my family members and all the dysfunction in my family and how I was seemingly trapped in the karmic cycles of my upbringing. For me to explain this I would have to tell my whole family history, which I'm not going to do.
713	2	a	Eventually, my parents did come home and I felt better about that and I just sat on the couch watching TV like a cosmic retard, trying not to look like I was on drugs, just being low key and quiet. Eventually, they both left to go do some other stuff and I was alone again, but by then I was feeling a bit more 'normal'. I was trying to remember all the stuff I was thinking about just hours before. I felt like I'd lived a whole lifetime in one afternoon. I felt energized. Shakti/Chi/Energy was coursing through my body. Moving around was effortless. I felt like I was floating. My pupils were huge and I went outside and looked at the sun going down and the moon becoming visible. My mind roared silently. Libra moon. Glorious. 
714	2	a	After a while a friend came over to my house and we went out to eat and I told him about my trip. All in all, it was a pretty intense experience.
715	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
716	2	a	So my experience begins on a cold New England night.  The sky is clear and the stars are shining brightly.  It's about 8:30pm when I decide that I should take the remaining acid from a 10 strip I bought a while back.  I was alone in my home, parents had gone away and my brother had wondered off to who knows where.  I felt that being alone for a trip could be a growing experience for me, since almost all my previous psychedelic experiences involved fairly large numbers of people being around.  My intension for this trip was to explore myself, my mind.  
717	2	a	So I slip the blotter onto my tongue, with that pre-trip tension in my stomach.  Then I go downstairs to my living room, and pop on the TV.  It's about 45 minutes later I notice the first effects.  The windows in the room had white lacy curtains with flower designs.  These flowers began to swirl majestically, while the curtains swayed in the acid breeze.  Then I looked at my couch, it was divided up into perfectly symmetrical squares that were all rotating counter-clockwise.  So I thought, 'well here I go'.  I only watched TV for another 10-15 minutes before I decided I should go to my room, throw on some music, turn the lights off, and lay in bed.  
718	2	a	I chose the new Tool album Lateralus as the soundtrack to my journey, and this suited the trip fine.  The album flew by, its almost a full 80 minutes long, but for some reason it went by very quickly.  So instead of time slowing like it should it went much faster at least for that 80 minutes.  But during that time I saw some of the most beautiful CEV's that I could ever have imagined.  The only one I remember vividly was what appeared to be some sort of a fish creature, that had no real head, and its whole body swayed through the liquid colors.  Around this time I began to think about my life.  I came to many conclusions about what I should do and where I should direct my life.  I also figured out what I percieved God really is, but I won't go into that.  I don't want to rant on about things that I think are nearly impossible to explain.  If anyone knows the album I was listening too, the last track 'Faaip De Oiad' is a creepy phone message from a man talking about aliens with loud jarring music.  When this came on I felt an incredible fear rush throughout my body, but it went away as soon as the song ended.  
719	2	a	After the cd was over, again it went by so quickly, I turned the lights in my room on.  My god I was tripping hard.  Everything was divided into symmetrical shapes, and were spinning wildly.  A poster on my wall, a print of a Alex Grey painting 'Praying', was very cool.  The persons veins in the painting were pulsing, the person seemed to be living. I then put on a Sonic Youth cd, listened to one song, got a jacket on and went outside.  I layed down inthe grass facing the sky.  The stars were absolutely stunning.  They were sparkling, and each star would change color frequently.  And if I focused I could make the sky become symmetric, divided into 3 sections.  I spent quite a while out there.  But when I came back to my room...the same song was playing on my cd player.  I guess the cd was on repeat, but that totally shocked me at the time.  I thought that I had walked outside, layed down and got back up, all in the span of a few notes.
720	2	a	The next few hours are pretty hazy, I know I watched some TV.  And I also know I felt no need to explore my mind anymore then I already had that night.  I felt I had all the answers I would ever need.
721	2	a	The trip really did change the way that I actually thought for a a few weeks.  It is hard to explain, but the way I thought was actually transformed.  The biggest effect was that nothing petty even fazed me.  I never felt like arguing about anything with anyone for any reason, that all felt below me.  But I noticed that that effect wore off over time, and I feel like my old self.  I don't know if thats good or bad though.
722	2	a	Overall this was a great experience, not my first, and definately not my last experience with this powerful drug.

724	2	a	LSD (2) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Alone (16)
725	2	a	Kid A and I decided to finish off our vial. Initially I was hesitant. That vial was supposed to last the whole summer, and was already half gone. But he gave an extremely convincing argument. Let's just do it all now, and go completely insane, it'll be so cool! I had to agree with him. It was going to be the greatest trip ever. 
726	2	a	So late that night, I took roughly 30-40 hits as did Kid A. I have yet to meet someone in person who has done this much! 
727	2	a	My visuals were simply amazing. Nothing has come even close to them. I was flipping through my Dali book, when suddenly, Dali's artwork seemed to take over my visuals. I ran to the bathroom, and in the mirror, my reflection was still my face, but it was my face painted just like Dali's own self-portrait in the book. Incredible. The whole world seemed to enter Dali's surrealistic fantasy. I was lost within the visuals and seemed to be consumed by them. I began conjuring up different images, and they seemed to flow from my mind in intricate, detailed patterns. 
728	2	a	Suddenly there was a noise. Kid A told me to shut up. I thought it was from within my house and turned off the lights, in case my parents were up. He told me to stop moving around...the sound was coming from outside. I didn't believe him, but within a few minutes I heard what he was talking about. It was coming from outside. 
729	2	a	Terror struck deep within me. What other-worldly entity could be stalking my friend and I? Had we accidentally opened a portal with our insanely huge dose of LSD? My initial response to this terror was to turn back on the lights. I needed to be able to see what was going on outside. WHAT WAS THERE?! 
730	2	a	As I got up to turn on the lights Kid A screamed, 'NO! That is a BAD idea!'. And suddenly I saw the incredible error that I was about to make and the horror that would be brought upon us. I inherently knew that if I were to turn on the lights the whole world surrounding me would dissolve into a primordial ooze. It would be lost and all that would remain would be a clear light with my soul being lost within its power forever. I knew that all would be lost, and I would be alone. I felt that LSD had created a cosmic hole in my head, and the entire universe would be sucked into it leaving me completely alone. 
731	2	a	Kid A and I lay in our separate beds, scarcely breathing. Both of our hearts racing, Kid A countlessly uttered, 'I'm tripping so hard, oh my god, this is really scary'. I too was feeling the intense effects surrounding me. My mind was awash in visuals. I was struggling to discern what was real around me, and was extremely grateful for having Kid A there. He helped ground me, and allowed me comfort in that I wouldn't be lost in this psychic journey. 
732	2	a	Slowly the terrifying presence seemed to take less of a hold on us, and actually became a little humorous. We decided to blast some Jimi Hendrix out my window. His righteous wailings on the guitar would surely scare the evil force that was residing on my front lawn. And it did. The intensity subsided quite a bit after this. But I don't exactly know when Kid A and I stopped tripping. We definitely had residual effects for the rest of the summer. Thinking back on it, I believe that I had tripped my way into an oblivious transcendent state. I felt enlightened, and appreciative of my life and my surroundings. What ensued after our crazy summer was perhaps the most productive and happy times of my life. I truly felt that life was beautiful, and every moment was to be treasured.  I was truly aware and happy. 
733	2	a	A note on this trip. At no time was this trip actually scary. I mean it was, but it was also incredible. It was extremely enjoyable. I loved each second of insane terror that was induced. It was almost too much to comprehend. I never thought that I could feel anything to this extent, and being able to almost brought tears to my eyes. It was a trip that reminded me that life is beautiful. Beauty is within everything. Don't believe me, just look at a tree for a minute. You'll find it and wonder how you could ever miss it. 
734	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
735	2	a	This is a first time dream of LSD.  One microdot (approximately 5mg in total weight) was imagined sublingually at about 5 minutes before 1am, at an underground (literally and figuratively) rave event, the microdot having been acquired some days before.
736	2	a	A few minutes later, the DJ is spinning a track, 'Being on LSD is like sailing Mt. Everest...' or something similar.  Very interesting synchronicity, but I that seems par for the course with any psychedelic material.
737	2	a	After an hour, nothing is happening yet, and various people with experience of these dots have been saying that they are not very strong and require multiple dosing.
738	2	a	About 2:20, I'm not sure I'm feeling anything at all even now, maybe it's threshhold and I can't tell because of all the stimulus around me.  Anyhow, another microdot is chewed, dissolved in my mouth and swallowed.  No real taste to speak of.
739	2	a	Maybe a half hour passes and I think I'm definitely off-baseline now, but this is very different from any tryptamine or phenethylamine psychedelic I've previously imagined.  I am talking to people and notice I've started to become brutally honest.  My coordination seems to be somewhat impaired.
740	2	a	From here, the effects continued to grow, and by another half hour I was definitely sure of the action in my system. This material was completely clear and free of seeming mental warp, but my attention is extremely focused and my ability to think about things without reservation or mental strain is enormously enhanced.  In this, the effects for me are similar to MDMA but without the empathetic aspect.  To the contrary, I have become extremely analytical and critical, without much emotional feeling at all.  I realize I need to be very careful not to hurt people's feelings with my brutal honesty right now, because I know I would not want to do so in other contexts, and I have to make an allowance for my present state of mind.
741	2	a	A bit later, I run into a girl I know, and my normal shyness being absent I tell her I think she's really cute.  She's with some other guy tonight, but I get her phone number, anyhow.  I find some other people I know in order to make sure I can get a ride home later.  I spend the next few hours, walking, contemplating, talking to various friends and strangers at the party, staying very clear and comfortable throughout.
742	2	a	About 6am my ride is leaving the party, I'm still up, but I have to say that nobody would likely be able to tell at all if I didn't say something about it.  I am at least as coherent as normal, and probably moreso, there's probably some eye dilation going on but it's still dark anyhow.  I have some interesting geometic closed eye visuals.
743	2	a	7:30 or so we stop for breakfast, and meet some others of my friends.  I give them my brief bioassay report, that I think the dots are probably a low dose of LSD and not LSA as some others had suggested they might be, as I've tried LSA before and it was more sedating and less clear.  I guess this might be 50ug or less of acid per dot, though.
744	2	a	9am, I'm home.  Wonder if I can sleep.  Amazingly enough, by 10am, I do.  I can't sleep on most any other psychedelic material I've imagined.  I wake up about 3pm, and seem not to want to sleep more, but I think I'm down now.  Some visual focus issues persist, and continue an hour later as I am now writing this, perhaps my eyes are still a bit dilated.
745	2	a	Note on pain relief: As I've written in previous reports, I have tried various materials for their pain relieving benefits, this one seems to work very well indeed, but I've had a few small twinges that suggest it may not persist more than a day or two. Obviously it is premature to judge that, and many substances have a strongly dose-dependent benefit.  For example, 5-MeO-DiPT at levels below about 14mg doesn't help me much, but at 16mg provided dramatic relief for at least a week.
746	2	a	I fully intend to find some more of these and try them in a larger dose sometime.  I'd also like to combine them with MDMA to see how they interact with regard to the enhancing qualities of both materials, and perhaps with preservation of emotional effect.

748	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Rave / Dance Event (18)
749	2	a	about 3 days ago my younger brother ken, dad, and i traveled to a concert where the dead were playing with willy nelson. when my dad told me about it, the one thing i was thinking about was if we could find any lsd... we were walking through the parking lot to the concert (which was just a giant grass field) it was about 85 degrees out and everybody was walking through rows of cars looking for anybody with the drug of their choice. at about noon, i was walking with my brother between rows of cars and many, many tiedye shirts and i saw a very pretty girl with colorful tatoos on her  mesh fabric and fairy wings comming out of her back walk by dotting the tip of her toungue with her index finger. 'ken, look its the acid faerie!' i whispered to my brother and turned around to follow her.
750	2	a	we bought about five doses of lsd off of the girl and took it at about 2:00 in the parking lot. the concert started at an old field near our parking field at 3:30 and my brother and i had just started feeling the one hit each of lsd in the form of a subtle visual clarity and warm buzzing feeling in the emotional column of our body and spreading throughout. we walked through the crowd of tiedye, dreadlocks, and smileing flowing people right up to about 15 feet of the stage. the ancient smile of willie nelson filled my whole existence as i watched him play and sing along side of phil lesh of the dead and i smiled with the most emense understanding and colorful love i had ever expirenced. the towers of speakers on the sides of the stage were spilling out a music that felt like it had been poured over my brother and i in a thick atmospheric wave of color, sound and emotion. i looked away from the stage after having totally suberged myself in something that clearly seemed to me to be deeper than any one persons life. as i looked through the crowd around me, it didnt seem tightly crowded...it was more as if all of the space had been taken up, yet there was no tension. noone pushed into anyone else, they just seemed to flow around each other in a way that was closer to a liquid than i had ever seen a group of about 100,000 humans act. in my mind, these people were beginning to encompass a visualization such as the spiecies of tree that connect their roots underground...but at ground level, just seem to be completely different organisms. there was almost no need for anyone to speak. there was a communication on a unanymous level that even someone at a complete outside perspective could sense strongly. at about 6:00 i averted my attention down to the ground. where the grass had been trampled by thousands of people the straw laying over the dirt began to move and mosaic into a beautiful pattern that seemed symetrical yet creative on every level of my being as i absorbed myself in its magnificence. my conciousness moved like an observer come to life, and when something interesting caught my attention, the observer followed it as if it was being tangibly pulled in that direction. and so a buzzing distraction in my mind demanded attention. i quickly realized that it was just part of me that wanted to see the sky. so i looked up out of my developing ground world through the layer of liquid people and straight out into the heavens. it was about 8:00 by now and the sun was setting in an intensly vibrant shapeshifting view that seemed to open my soul until i could feel one with the universe. i could feel...as if tangibly...that my senses were diffusing into one another and that my whole inner universe and body was diffusing into the whole of the outer universe. i began thinking about what my old line of pereseptions felt like. i had almost forgot id lived my whole life in a systmatic, 'normal' world and felt sad. 'i cannot beleive i couldnt grasp that this world even existed before now.' (at this point, the concept of 'now' felt actually quite alien to the truth) as i began to fold back to earth i asked my brother with a grin on my face, if he could stop smiling. we both stood still and twisted our lips superficially to try and frown then burst out in laughter not 3 seconds later. a little while later, my soul diffused into the music again.
751	2	a	by about 1:00 in the morning, as willy nelson and the dead bowed to the giant cheering sea of color, people, and the sweet musk of hashish that filled the air, i breathed out a sigh and my chest seemed to collapse back in forever, as if the whole experience was one breath of holy understanding. i guess the theme that seemed to umbrella the entirity of the trip was that understanding in itself has lead directly to the thing being understood, and if there is any other inhibitive emotion, then there is something left to be grasped. i thought this right at the end of the concert when walked away aching with pleasure as id been standing for about 13 hours strait and my face hurt from smiling for so long!
1	1	a	I donÂt know if there exists a good game recipe to play while on marijuana. We also tried Dreamfall and we were fascinated every inch of the way through the city. Agon: The Mysterious Codex creates a solid setting too but can get frustrating. Myst seems like a good choice - I havenÂt tried yet but I imagine that it can get frustrating. Condemned 2 might ring a whistle. Fact is that you can believe in scary things more readily, live them more thoroughly.
2	1	a	All in all, I consider cannabis to be a great substance for living stories (medium to large doses, 100-200mg+ high quality/pers.).

5	1	a	This was not my first experience with pot, but it certainly was the best that I have ever had. 
6	1	a	It was 5/21/08 and my friend S and I had the intention to hang out at her cousin H's house and possibly smoke weed and we had discussed this at school and planned it all out. As soon as it was time to go at 3:00 PM, I met her outside the classroom and we walked off to her car and left for a place to get a bite to eat and then to my place to get some shit if I had any left. We got to my house and I found that there was only a tiny roach left, so I took that, a pair of tweezers, and a lighter. Now, this was some good shit I had thought, so I didn't want to waste any. We got in the car after saying bye to my parents, and we left to go to her cousin H's house. Little did I know what was in store for me.
7	1	a	4:30 PM: The car pulls in at cousin H's place. I've got my weed in my pocket, along with my tweezers and lighter. Now, S had told me that H was big into weed so I didn't feel as if I should keep this from anybody or not, so I brought up the topic of pot so we all started discussing it and such. A couple minutes later, H's cell phone rings and it is supposedly her dealer that has called so S and I both looked at each other excitedly as cousin H said 'You ready for me to spend a hundred dollars? Yeah, I'll be there soon.' Cousin H got us in the car and we set out to the dealers house. 
8	1	a	5:00 PM: We arrive at said dealer's household with a large rust-red volkswagon bus with hippie stickers all over it, and flowers popping about here and there in the garden. S and I wait in the car while H goes in to get the weed. About 10 minutes later, H comes back and the smell of mint/skunk immediately fills my nostrils as I move up to see what she's got. Holy shit, this stuff smells so fucking good. Cousin H unwraps the magazine page and reveals the most beautiful marijuana that I had ever been blessed in my entire life to see. Absolutely fucking beautiful weed;  some real top notch stuff. S and I smile at H as she wraps it back up and we set off back home.
9	1	a	5:30 PM: S, H, and I get back to Cousin H's place and we go to the side yard where the table and chairs are. H talks to S about being a designated driver, what if she gets too high, what her parents will say, ect.. while I get out my little roach and tweezers and light it up. I take about 1 puff off it and it's already much too small for me to smoke anymore so I just put it in my pocket for me to unwrap and roll in another joint later. Well, S puts some eye drops in so I figure I should do the same and we're both smiling really big at each other as we do this. Cousin H goes back in the house to roll a joint, and as she comes out I was greeted with the most amazing looking hooter I had ever seen in my life! H lights it and takes a few puffs and then hands it to me, seeing as my parents know I smoke weed and are fine with it. I take 2 pretty good hits off it and wait a minute, and them a couple more and give it back to H and thank her graciously for being able to smoke that wonderful smelling, looking, tasting, joint. 
10	1	a	5:35 PM: I cannot feel a thing, and I wonder what is up with the weed. I know it's great stuff, so I lay back and figure that it's just a creeper. 
11	1	a	5:40 PM: I REALLY feel it now! S didn't want to get high, but shit I think I'm high for the both of us at this point. Cousin H looks pretty fried too, but she can act perfectly straight if need be. I need to learn that talent.. 
12	1	a	5:45 PM: I break into the chip bag, and Cousin H and I tore that bitch up, haha. 
13	1	a	5:49 PM: Yes, I'm looking at my watch and writing the times and everything that's gone on. I feel really messed up, and I start to explain how I feel to Cousin H. She looks at S and says 'oh dear god what have we done!' with a huge laugh at the end. I get on the trampoline and jump as high as I possibly can and I jump way above the netting. I feel as if I close my eyes, I'd be teleported away into outer space I'd be up so high. No, I'd be so high that God himself would put his hand to his forehead and gaze up into the sky and watch me fly up, up and away! Nobody and nothing could bring me down now, absolutely nothing. My skull is unscrewed like a bottle cap and my soul is wisping out and away with the wind from the center of my head. I feel completely dissasociated from my body and I touch things to see if they are real. All of my emotions, feelings, memories, hopes, and dreams are being poured out of my skull, and I feel as if everyone else can sense them as well. I feel very united, I feel perfect. I jump higher and higher, not even God with a telescope could possibly see me. I jump higher, and I hit my head on the ceiling of space and flutter back down, laughing. I feel a full body orgasm and every cell in my body is screaming with the most amazing pleasure it's ever felt. It's good to be human and I love life and everything in it. Well, everything but sadness, but that doesn't exist now. No, not now it doesn't.
14	1	a	6:00 PM: There are a lot of people here and I am tired so I sit back at the table where everyone is congrigated. S suggests that we leave because I'm acting really weird, so we do. I wanted to be with the people and possibly tell them how good I feel so that they can feel the same pleasure, but I didn't have the chance to. Oh well.
15	1	a	6:10 PM: We arrive at Taco Bell. I order a bean burrito and she doesn't order a damn thing because she isn't high. I tell you what, that bean burrito tasted like heaven.
16	1	a	6:15 PM: We go to the gas station to get gas, and I run in and get 3 packs of gummy candies to eat. I think the lady at the cash register could tell I was fried off my ass, but I didn't care. We get back in the car and I tear open the packages and get to eating.
17	1	a	6:30 PM: The car is driving at an incredible speed as we go up this mountain, I can fly! I throw octopus gummies on the window of the car and laugh my ass off with S. 
18	1	a	6:35 PM: We get to the top of the mountain and I take pictures of it. I want to jump off this mountain and fly so damn badly. I have the most amazing wings, and they say 'PEACE, HOPE, and LOVE.' and I can do anything I set my mind to;  I want to fly. 
19	1	a	6:40 PM: Apparently that didn't work to well, because S had to shove me back in the car because I really wanted to jump off. Oh well. We set off to drive around town and just chill. I can feel the peak of the high barely wearing off, but it is still ten times or more powerful than any shit I've ever had.
20	1	a	7:00 PM: I arrive home, I don't know how, but I'm here. My parents are sitting on the couch and I'm trying as hard as I can to look sober because I've got to get a job interview done soon. I can't worry about that now, so I go up to my bedroom and just listen to music. I find that everything sounds a lot better than they usually do, and stuff is a whole lot cooler to watch. I could do this every day all day..
21	1	a	7:30 PM: I'm completely knocked out cold at the point, because I laid down and the cozyness of it all drifted me off to sleep. I dreamt of candy, flowing everywhere, spinning in circles, dancing across my field of vision;  melting, twirling, dancing, like a tribe of Native Americans doing the Corn Dance. 
22	1	a	It really was the best experience on pot that I have ever had. Since then my stuff hasn't felt as good since, haha. Have fun out there!

24	1	a	I assume it is a somewhat infrequent occurrence to have such a severe, psychedelic-esque trip report to be reported just from Cannabis use, but this is what happened. 
25	1	a	Background of the Story: This was less than a week after I got a somewhat bad concussion, though the symptoms of it were strange and it was hard to pinpoint the status of my head. My tolerance to weed has always been very low, but because of my recent concussion, this experience was something unrivalled in intensity, and the effects it induced are not at all representative of what one thinks of when they think of a Marijuana experience. 
26	1	a	Story: I decided I would invite my friend over, just to get some company to feel more occupied and less bored. When he arrived, we started smoking some weed out of a bong. The strain was Maui Wowie, a strong sativa, and the batch I had smoked was of fine quality. I was loaded a fat bowl out of the bong, and smoked it in two big rips. 
27	1	a	Some incredible effects immediately began to become present. I remember after I smoked it, I was trying to play a video game I enjoyed on the computer, but I noticed I was becoming too sensually agitated and went to sit down in the bathroom. I remember covering my hand, and was starting to shake. The weed had hit me too hard, it was starting to become a very unpleasant experience. I placed my hands on my face, I remember being incredibly high, telling my friend that I had to go to bed, and then went upstairs and lay down. 
28	1	a	This is when the trip really escalated. I was sitting in bed, my mind was becoming delusionally paranoid, I was fearing my parents might walk in and see me in this state. I felt my heart rate was probably something in between 150-200 bpm, and I was worried. My body was completely shaking, I could feel the bed vibrating because of it. The probably only positive (ish) thing that happened on the trip were the hallucinations. With my eyes closed, the hallucinations were vivid and memorable. At one point, I remember seeing a green circle surrounded by darkness which had a thick diameter of some sort of ancient looking design within its diameter. The circle had distinct symbolic figures lying on points all around it, and was fulling rotating. Then, as the hallucination became more and more vivid, its reality slowly overpowering my perception, I had to open my eyes. When I did this, the darkness of my eyes closed which surrounded the circle was replaced with the darkness of the room, though I could see the rest of my room in this darkness. The hallucination continued vividly as ever. 
29	1	a	After this, I can say that I had open-eye hallucinations induced from only weed (there was no way it was laced, as my friends smoked it and had normal experiences). Overall, when compared to my two experiences with Mushrooms, this cannabis experience was more intense in hallucination, bodily sensation, and most ways. The divine clarity of mushrooms was not at all present, however. Although it is hard to compare substances, this weed experience (although not enjoyable) made me higher than I was on shrooms and is one I look back at in amazement.

31	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
32	1	a	Last week I woke up and immediately ate a fairly potent cannabis brownie thinking that it wouldn't hit by the time I got to the airport. Boy was I wrong. One hour later and I'm stoned off my ass attempting to make conversation with my mom on the way to the airport. She had to have known. I had planned on taking a second edible when I got to the airport but decided against it as the first one was already working its magic.
33	1	a	As soon as I got in the security line I felt a surge of paranoia. With the recent terrorist attack in Brussels I couldn't help but feel anxious at a major city airport. I could tell that the people around me were nervous as well. Nobody was looking each other in the eye and there was an air of uneasiness. I noticed the keen attention the TSA was giving to people of color. One elderly lady in a hijab was asked to pass through the metal detector three times before she was allowed to proceed. I felt guilty for being afraid. For giving in to the reaction of hate fueled ideologies.
34	1	a	As soon as I got through security I was able to relax a bit more. I got to my gate and watched passengers hurriedly walk among the airport corridors. Each person with their own complex lives crossing my path for a single fleeting moment in the form of a fellow traveler. I was the same to them.
35	1	a	The edible had taken full effect by the time the plane had taken off. As the plane got higher and higher, the tiny houses below got tinier and tinier. The arrangement of streets below began to resemble tree roots, branching off from one another as far as the eye could see. As we ascended above the clouds, they too began to take geometric form and seemed to have an almost Aztec-like architectural filter. 
36	1	a	Then something peculiar happened. Something that I have not experienced even in my endeavors with the classic hallucinogens. I was watching the clouds and I could see colorful light patterns begin to define themselves against the white background. As these patterns became more evident they came together to form a bird. While the features of this bird were not clearly defined, its overall shape was. For the next 5 to 10 minutes I was flying next to this light bird that seemed to be playfully flapping in the wind. I rubbed my eyes, opened and closed them, pinched myself, did everything I could to convince myself my mind was playing tricks and still the bird persisted in my visual processes. For the first time in my life, I was having a 'hallucination' that appeared to be more than just mere sensory distortion. The bird eventually stopped in the middle of my visual view and spread its wings as if to reveal all of its glory, turned around and flew away into the distance.
37	1	a	I don't know what to make of this experience. On one hand, my mind is playing visual tricks when presented with the blank white space that is the clouds. However, on the other hand, this seems to fall right into the category of a true mystical experience. One thing is certain, I got more than I expected out of the edible.

39	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Glowing Experiences (4), General (1), Large Group (10+) (19)
40	1	a	It was the night of the school reunion. Me and an old classmate shared about half a bottle of vodka. That of course made us a bit drunk, even if we are experienced drinkers (we are from Denmark).
41	1	a	But as the reunion drew to a close, we wanted to continue the party in the big city. And so we did, but not before a quick trip to 'Christiania' (the 'freetown' in Copenhagen, much like a mini-Amsterdam, I guess). There we bought two nice hashish cookies. Nothing new about that, we have been eating cookies many times. But these were not the cookies we were used to.
42	1	a	We eat em, and went into a club in Copenhagen. The club was packed with people, and a handful from the reunion too. Well, the club is not the kind of club we normally go to. This was pop, and we prefer techno.
43	1	a	Then things started to get crazy (remembering that this is 'only' hashish). Suddenly I realized that I was totally wasted! I heard all the voices clearly now. It was pretty funny, I could hear conversations across the lounge-room, just being able to ignore the rest of the noise. And looking at peoples' faces, time sort of slowed down, and I had the feeling that I had known that person for a long time, knew what he/she was like, knew where they grew up, etc. They were all unique characters in a movie. A funny thing.
44	1	a	Then I got more and more tunnel vision, and more and more disorientated about where I was, and what to do. People from my old school (that had been at the reunion too) came over and talked to me. But I didn't understand a word of what they were saying. Not that I couldn't clearly hear them, it just didn't make sense. When I tried to speak, jibberish came out of my mouth too. I was so confused, what had I just said?!
45	1	a	Well, communicating with anyone but my best friend became impossible, I had just realised. So why not move to the dancefloor? The music was pretty nice. (It wasnt. It was terrible pop music, but at the time it was really nice).
46	1	a	Then something strange happened. Something I have never tried with cannabis before. I got sort of a hallucination! As I was standing on the dancefloor (unable to really move my body to the music by the way), the volume of the sound seemed like it got turned down, and I could only hear the bass sound, like a heartbeat. And the colors from the dancefloor light became very sharp, almost blinding me. Then my point of view got elevated to the celling, and as it did, I saw that all the people looked like flat cardboard people. Like sprites, in two dimensions, in a three dimensional room.
47	1	a	Then I got sort of scared, that was not supposed to happen! I said to my friend I wanted to leave now, course this was not what I wanted. And then we left the club.
48	1	a	I'm sure people thought I was on acid or something, I was talking jibberish about the cardboard people at the dancefloor.
49	1	a	We got outside, and went to get something to eat at the fast food place. Ordering was very hard, and confusing too. And eating the burgers was a slow process. I don't remember much of this myself, but I was told it took me around 15 minutes to eat a burger.
50	1	a	Then we took a taxi home. And I remember the street we drove down was almost infinitely long. Also pretty strange. My friend got dropped off at his house, and then there was a 5-10 minute drive to my place. Then I started getting a little worried that the driver was going to cheat me, or drive me to some remote location and drop me off. But he didnt an I somehow got home!
51	1	a	Fell asleep and woke up confused and disorientated a few time the next few hours.
52	1	a	To sum it up. I was very surprised by how fast and powerful the cookies worked on me. And very surprise to almost see a halo! But it was a very fun 'trip'... I must have had a stupid smile on my face all the time.
53	1	a	My best friend didnt get wasted that quickly. He got wasted when he came home, two hours after. Still very powerful, but not as heavy as I.
54	1	a	I think they might have been a little nice in mixing the cookies that day :)

56	1	a	Cannabis - Hash (93) : Club / Bar (25), General (1)
57	1	a	This is a report of my first time smoking alone on a school night. I haven't experimented with many drugs before, just weed and pharms, having had a very good time doing them on all occasions.
58	1	a	8:00-I sneak downstairs to avoid the watchful eye of my parents and begin to pack a bowl with some good quality weed that has brought me some very good times in the past. After I've finished I watch some T.V. and wait until my parents go to sleep.
59	1	a	11:00-My parents have finally gone to sleep and I hurry downstairs to grab my homemade bong. I sneak out the back door, onto my porch, and into my backyard, but it is extremely windy outside, so I decide to return onto my screened-in porch.
60	1	a	11:05-I finish smoking and return to my house. I notice that the wind outside seems more harsh and it freaks me out a little. Inside, I notice haloish affects around lights and my hearing is dulled.
61	1	a	11:45-After watching some flash videos, very hilarious, I decide to go and take a shower to remove the smell and so that I wont have to do it in the morning.
62	1	a	11:55-The warm shower water makes my skin feel incredibly tingly and I feel very relaxed. While standing there, I have an epitome. I realize that this shower water is composed of thousands of little droplets, just like people in a society, and that these droplets are separated and become individuals when they are shot out of the shower head, just like being born. I also realize that their existence is short, just as ours is, and that they all rejoin each other at the drain, just as we all end up in the same position: dead.
63	1	a	12:10-I finish my shower and go to bed. I quickly fall asleep and dream of myself traveling through the world as a droplet of water.
64	1	a	I wake up the next morning, still remembering my experience. I feel as if I must try harder to make my existence worthwhile because I know that my time on this earth is short and if I don't do anything about it, I'll end up in that drain having wasted my time.

129	1	a	Went down the road for a couple of drinks (flatmates friends birthday), night started off normal, listening to music etc. Awhile later there were some deserts passed around, truffles and brownies but these contained cannabis.  Just had 1 of each, why not, no commitments at the timeÂ Having a good timeÂ going up and down stairs (others up there) while coming down the stairs spotted (for the first time) the occupants large ornament of Buddha in some stone colored blue, interestingly placed as you walk down, wow I thought that was cool.  Felt quite high from the sweets, as only had 2 drinks, and started to feel it more and more with racing heart and jelly legs! Thought it was time to head home, just down the roadÂ Opened the door, something didnÂt feel quite right, went to my room, 1 cat was on bed that woke up, meowing and kept meowing wouldnÂt stop, thought there was something seriously wrong with him, this accelerated the high more, then felt like someone or something was in the house, so checked round, of coarse nothing physical, but something wasnÂt right and both cats acting strange (mind you-they missing 1 owner who was away).  To the lounge, sat down to try relax because it was intense and heart race, while trying to relax/meditate/breathing Â felt powerful forces, spiritual energy pulsing through my body, especially focused on hands, knees, spine, head. Like electricity race up the spine to the head and out the top (no real closed eye visuals except pulsing light).   
130	1	a	While this was happening 1 thing that crossed my mind was Âa crystalÂ relation? and also that Buddha a saw earlierÂ This part sitting down wasnÂt scary (like the cats) but intense, felt like it was more than something that just the plant set off.  Wow.  As far as the cats go, when arriving home earlier I thought they where trying to tell me of a spirit in the house, but reflecting on it a day or 2 later, I have a feeling Âspirit inside catÂ?Â and not able to look at the cats eyes since without uneaseÂ donÂt like cats as much now (feel like they are stealing good energy).  
131	1	a	DidnÂt get much sleep that morning but when I woke up I felt like I had some sort of awakening! Only sort of similar to 1 or 2 other times in my life - (A SIMILAR HIGH/GOING UP THE SPINE -AFTER JUST SMOKING 1 BUCKET),, (IN SOME WAYS MORE INTENSE THAN SOME OF MY MESC/CACTUS TRIP BUT WITHOUT THE VISUALS).  Had to write it down.

134	1	a	The following story is completely true, not a bit stretching the truth.
135	1	a	Last night I went to a club in SOMA San Francisco. I watched a few sets from the band, and after finishing my Hefeweizen I to outside to bum a cigarette. A woman with curly black hair offers me a joint. I smoke one fair toke, cough a bit, but not too much. After that I was pretty much gone. 
136	1	a	The bouncers from the club tell us, ÂYou canÂt have that on the premises,Â then one of them says, ÂCanÂt you read the sign, says no-meth zone.' Or something like that. We stumble down the street. I could not comprehend what she had meant. I ask the woman I am with, Nivette, and she says, ÂI think she is being sarcastic.Â I still donÂt understand. ÂItÂs just potÂ I say. Nivette responds, yeah my family accepts this as a normal thing. I was too naÃ¯ve to ask if there was anything else in the joint. Or actually, I was just stupid to accept a joint from a strange woman. From what I read afterwards about experiences on meth, I think the joint was laced with PCP or something.
137	1	a	I started to talk to Nivette about this guy Ezra I had been dating for about a month. He had just broken up with me that day because he is Jewish and I am not. It was something that bothered me and I did not understand it. I hoped that by telling people I could get some insight. Nivette says she is attracted to Jewish men, she says she is Babylonian which she says goes way back before the Jews. Then I think it would be a good idea for Nivette to talk to Ezra. I call him, itÂs about 11pm at this point, and Nivette immediately reprimands him, ÂWhy are you breaking up with this woman, just because she is not Jewish? She is a princess!Â 
138	1	a	Next thing I know Nivette and I are kissing against a chain link fence. My phone still open as Ezra listens to me kissing and breathing, ÂOhhÂ this is soo nice.Â Nivette brings me up against a small tree or parking meter, I slide down it as she feels me up. People are walking down the sidewalk, couples hand in hand, amazed to find two women making out on the ground. Her hands moving over my smooth dress, my breasts, between my legs. Then I look up at peoplesÂ stares of amazement, and realize what is happening, ÂWhoah, what is going on.Â I get up and walk down the street with the lighter, Â¼ of a joint and my phone still open. 
139	1	a	I hear some good rap music coming from a taqueria across the street. I jaywalk across the 5-lane road. I start moving to the beats as I walk up to the window. I determine the man making burritos is amazingly cute and I tell him he is gorgeous, he smiles. I walk up to a guy eating at a table outside, and have a strange conversation. Then I realize I am freezing and I go up to a group of people stepping into a van. I feel the warmth from inside the car and I ask where they are going. I end up telling them to all ride bikes and I slide the van door shut.
140	1	a	I walk back across the street and this guy with a blue mowhawk steps out of a cab. I go up to him and smooth his hair up between my two hands and exclaim, ÂThat is awesome, I love it!Â He laughs as he walks away. I continue to go up to strangers talking gibberish. I felt like I was dreaming! Really I was like, wow, when am I going to wake up. 
141	1	a	At this point I was cold and wanted back in the club. I go up to the bouncers and they say, ÂYou are too intoxicated to enter.Â I say in disbelief, ÂWow, what is going on here? This has never happened to me, I have my ticket right here, see my stamp?Â I hold out my hand. ÂWe donÂt care.Â Then he takes a black marker and draws two large Xs on the tops of my hands. I try to enter anyway and two men PUSH me back out. 
142	1	a	I leave, amazed this is happening. Now I feel like I am in a nightmare. I walk up to a homeless man and buy his newspaper, then start to cry, telling people, ÂThis man is homeless!Â I was so cold, the wind ripping between the buildings and this homeless man just standing out there. He responds sadly, ÂI am just trying to make enough money to get a place to stay.Â
143	1	a	I felt so far away from my home, like I would never get back. I go back to the club and walk in thinking I can pretend they wonÂt notice me, but they push me out again. Some people come out of the club and I go up to a couple, drawn by the beauty of the guy. I tell him he is beautiful and reach to feel his hair, then I turn to his girlfriend and say, ÂYou are not good enough for him.Â(!) And she replies, ÂWell, I am glad you feel that way.Â Wow!
144	1	a	I call my friend who is inside and he comes out. I say they wonÂt let me in and they explain I am too intoxicated. I donÂt know what my friend is thinking at this point. Finally the show ends and my friends get a cab and we all get in. We go to their hotel, I think I even kissed my friendÂs friend in the elevator, a woman I hardly know. I lay on their hotel bed and I wanted to make out with the two women, but they get me up and take me home in a cab. I get home and I am like, ÂOh my god what just happened!?Â
145	1	a	So let this be a lesson, donÂt accept drugs from strangers!

147	1	a	Cannabis (1) : General (1), What Was in That? (26), Various (28)
148	1	a	Well it was during the middle of summer vacation my friend paid 60 dollars for an eighth of this really good smelling marijuana from a guy that usually doesnÂt get the best stuff. But he claimed that this was really Âbomb ass dankÂ. So we bought it expecting to get the same stuff that we usually get and to be high for about 1 hour. So I stayed at my friends house that night to smoke it and he had already been caught by his dad once so we had to be careful about how we did it. We started at about 11:00pm and we had an awesome glass pipe I had just bought from my friend with a nice size bowl packed into it already. My friend since he paid for it got the first hit. After it got passed to me about 10 times I was done and ready to trip out. We had smoked in all about 2 bowls and then couldn't even inhale smoke anymore so we were forced to quit.
149	1	a	After that I don't really know what happened we listened to a mix of songs I had made especially to make u trip out. There was lots of techno and weird stuff like English guys singing. Then we got to the techno song called ÂMarijuana In Your BrainÂ this is when all the weird shit started happening. My spine felt like it was moving up and down through my back making it tingle, my head felt like it was flying off of my body into heaven, and my feet stayed on the ground which sort of scared me because I'm afraid of heights and looking down from the clouds was pretty high up, and I could see myself going through the ground all the way to the core of the earth. It was the craziest thing I have ever felt.
150	1	a	Then we realized that we had a huka party poster that reacted to a black light that we haven't even looked at yet. So we turned on my blacklight and I looked at the poster and listened to the music again. I was laying on my friends floor staring at the poster when all of the sudden there were 4 mushrooms in the corner that started moving in a circle, and all of the sudden I was sitting in this park and all these kids were yelling and I couldn't figure out what was going on. But luckily then I realized I didnÂt like this and it was the song doing this to me so I jumped up and switched the song.
151	1	a	Then I laid back down on the floor looked up and closed my eyes. When I opened them it was morning but I was still feeling a little high so I got up and then decided we were going to go out for breakfast so we smoked another bowl and went for breakfast at the same place we work. That was a mistake because when we came back the high was pretty much done ,it had been about 3 hours and his dad had came home early, he ran into my friends room after us and opened my friends dresser and pulled out all of our weed, pipe, and a methadone pill we had just got. My friend was grounded for month and his dad never told my parents. My friend that I had got the pipe from was pretty mad because he had smoked about 4000 times out of it and now it was gone. I now have quit because this whole time I have been getting piss tested by my parents and if I fail another one I have to go to rehab.

153	1	a	Cannabis (1) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
154	1	a	This experience was a few years ago so i cannot remember all the details, insted of inputting every detail I will get streight to the point.
155	1	a	While on the computer on a sunny day a friend (We will call him Danny ) contacted me on MSN and told me that his parents and family had gone away for the weekend and asked me if I wanted to stay over. I was good mates with another friend of his that lived near him that I had spoked to on the internet we will call him Luke. As I'd been wanting to meet Luke face to face for a while we always plannned to get together and have a smoke-up. I was most delighted and at about 5pm I got down to his village met up with Luke and went to his dealers. We only had Â£10 and so this could of scored us an 8th but the guy only had 2 teenths so we baught them. We eventualy met up with Danny. He was with his cousin and his cousins mate, I didnt mind them comming as im a generous smoker and dont mind sharing my shit.
156	1	a	Eventually the smoking started in Dannys backgarden. We took it kinda easy to start with rolling big joints with about 10 minute gaps inbetween rolling again. We was all having a good time laughing, joking and telling stories. The time was about 8pm and after the 5th joint I felt a bit giddy but it felt like my laughter was fake and I slowly fell into depression. Ive experienced and know others have experienced feeling down from smoking cannabis before but this time it was more of a strong feeling. 
157	1	a	While in this state I kept quiet and kept on smoking while observing the conversation going on by the others. I was occasionally asked by them every so often if i was alright, I gave them a nod and replied that I was fine. I was layed down and the depressive state kept creeping up on me. By this time I was very intoxicated and eventually my vision was consumed with bright moving patterns. I began thinking about my life, friends, family and my future, but that was making me more depresssed as I didnt have a clue what I was going to do with myself after College. I began thinking how i was percived by  people that knew me. Then It hit like a ton of bricks, I understood how i was percived. I could see myself reconstructing was i was like around people like my friends for example, was I some sort of Geek or some annoying moron that other people look down on? could this be the reason why I dont always remain friends with people? because I cramp there style? Was this me? Millions of these thoughs rushed around my head while each one was reanacted in my mind. Everybody else at this time was chilled out with only a two way conversation going on. I asked everybody else if they was mashed (Mashed meaning very stoned/intoxicated) they and they agreed. 
158	1	a	A good few hours after I was coming down to earth and Felt much better. I was in denial about the thoughs I encounted that night for a while and eventaully I came to terms with them. All of it was true. Back then I admit I was kind of annoying, lacked communication skills, and made people feel uncool while I was around them. 
159	1	a	Now-a-days I am more sociable, have better communication skills and Have more friends. Maybe cannabis helped me see this properly and helped me see the door to improving my life and life style.

161	1	a	Cannabis (1) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Depression (15), Small Group (2-9) (17)
162	1	a	My experience occured about a year and a half ago, when I was 14 and heavily into drinking and smoking marijuana. . .I was in the middle of a football camp week, and that night I had a few friends over. We were basically bored, until one of my other friends called my up and asked if I wanted to go smoke some weed, and threw out there that he had some dust, so I happily agreed. We walked our asses about a mile to some bridge in the woods next to a lake.
163	1	a	Well anyway, he busts out this shitty ass wooden bowl and we throw all that stuff in there and smoke it. We then stand up and about 5-10 minutes later we're really feeling it, my friend sayss, 'dude, just pretend we're sitting in some big ass reclining chairs watching TV' so I did it. . .it was soooo comfy and real feeling. My other friends(who were sober) said we sat in the most uncomfertable looking positions for about 20 minutes.
164	1	a	After that we journied off the bridge into a trail in the woods, my friend starts doing to siccest impression of the Corcodile Hunter, he was like, 'look over there! it's a three-toed sloth with Goneria' and I get down on all fours and start doing all the habbits he is saying it does. . .including sexing my friends mother and walking extremely slowly(later my friends told me i was crawling through glass not even phasing me).
165	1	a	We continued down the trail until we looked out onto the lake and saw some floating lily pads. . .or so we thought. We kept focusing on these things until we got closer, and they started moving! This was all in the dark so me and my friend start bugging out thinking it was a submarine coming up from the depths. . .THEN! we instantly found ourselves in the middle of the Vietnam War for some reason, shooting 'charlies'.
166	1	a	Later down the trail we hit some LONG grass which was really bugging us because it felt like bugs on our legs, but my friend says, 'man, we cant feel this, our legs are covered in foam'. . .and that instant the irritation dispeared, it was great. A few feet more and we found ourselves in one of those old Mario games for nintendo, picturing it seemed so real, like I was really in it. . .
167	1	a	Well, the last funny thing to happen was I closed my eyes while we were walking and I could still picture the suroundings as if my eyes were open, but it was changing colors like crazy. . .until, SLAM! I walked right into the raised bridge. . .5 minutes later I noticed I had a huge gash on my arm, and continued to go off on my friend for about 5 more minutes about how they should have told me the bridge was there.
168	1	a	Man that was great. . .I haven't done it since, but I probably soon will.

170	1	a	Cannabis (1), PCP (113) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Nature / Outdoors (23), General (1)
171	1	a	Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] 
172	1	a	It's fair to say I'm a stoner.  I smoke pot just about every day, spend my money on pot, and regularly go to school/work stoned, and no one really notices.  So generally, I don't get really fucked from a bowl or two.
173	1	a	The other day, though, I bought some shit from a buddy of mine.  It was a fat eighth, so naturally, I assumed the volume was to make up for the fact it was shitty regs.  Fuck it, I rolled a couple joints, went out, smoked a joint, got a surprising high, but straightened myself out with some music and TV, and fell out early.  
174	1	a	I knew this was good shit when I smelled it, but looking back, I'd gotten far more fucked than I should have from what I smoked....  Anyway, I took some bong hits with a buddy the day after, but then the next day, I went out into the woods, at a favorite spot of mine, and lit up a joint.  At this point I was waiting for someone...  After I finished, I was immediately at a regular point of high, and I still had a bowl on me, so I said fuck it, and lit up.  A couple deep hits, and I was sitting on a log with my head hung, looking at the ground.  
175	1	a	All of a sudden, I heard a ticking in my head... it wasn't that loud that I thought there was a giant clock or something, but I was unable to completely phase it out.    So I focussed on it, and as I foccused on the ticks, and I saw a line of pink, red, and green crossing my vision, straight across.  My vision continued to light up, and things in the ground became highlighted, images in the pine needles.  I saw a lot of A's outlined, as if I was suddenly seeing what was drawn in the pine needles.  I had a sense of profound purpose about these images, but was not altogether out of control enough to shout it out to the world.  I was fully conscious that I was high, but things that happened were just uncontrollable.... There were the usual thoughts, for me, of writing a show in my head as it goes along, and watching it in my head, laughing at the funny parts but often getting into plots too complicated and completely forgetting what I was thinking about, but there were further, physical visual hallucinations.
176	1	a	When someone walked their dogs past me, I was able to focus enough to keep my visuals down to a blur and some excess colors, and put my head in my lap.  Soon after asserting control over these visions, I began to feel as if I was in purgatory, still on my log bench, but as if focusing one way or the other I could enter different worlds, one progressingly further into images of the pine needles, becoming so complex as to be completely colored clowns' faces, the other the 'real' world, just me, cold, in the woods.  
177	1	a	I soon realized an hour or so had passed, and I was starting to come down.  I could not realize half of what had happened that I told myself to remember, because it was crazy, but my friend never showed up, and apparently I made some calls to another friend of mine flipping out...  This shit must have been laced, but hell, I don't care.

179	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Alone (16), Nature / Outdoors (23), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
180	1	a	When this experience occured I had already gone through various experiments with weed, and was used to the mind altering effects. The story begins when I was hanging out with a couple of friends, hitting the bowl. We had been passing it back and forth taking deep hits of the bud, which was extremely potent. We had been smoking for a while and I had yet to feel the high set in so I kept smoking. We finished off the herb and started to walk down the street, slowly my mind oozed into a dream like state, which was considerably pleasent. 
181	1	a	We had reached my street and as I looked around I noticed a house that seemed to look exactly like mine except completely backwards, also the houses around it were similar to those around mine. At that moment  I could only think that I was in a universe that contradicted the one that I was in while I was sober. I told my friends my thoughts and they all seemed to agree. I then had a vision, but not a halucination about the future. In the vision we were sitting in my neighbors driveway at night rolling a joint when a cop car pulled up. At the time I thought nothing of it and proceeded rambling about my parallel universe.
182	1	a	 About 10 minutes later we were in my neighbors driveway and one of my friends suggested rolling a joint,it was then I remembered my vision,  told my friends that this was my vision and we had to go somewhere else, but everyone was stoned and had lost all motivation to move. I made them move and we went so someones back yard, about 5 minutes later I saw I cop car drive down the street with a spot light going really slow. It was amazing, I still dont no if it was just deja vu or the weed?

185	1	a	I hadn't smoked weed in well over 2 years when I decided one night to take a friend up on an offer to get high and go to the school's homecoming football game.  We acquired a dugout and a one-hitter from a friend and proceeded to smoke approximately 7 hits each.
186	1	a	Initially I was dissapointed that I wasn't feeling the effects at all, and began to think that maybe what we had smoked hadn't been weed at all, and that I wasn't going to feel anything that night.  On the car ride to the school, I began to feel very relaxed, and out of body, almost.  As I looked out the window nothing seemed quite real.  I decided then that I didn't want to go to the game, and instead would prefer to sit at home and study the wonderful effects I was feeling.
187	1	a	I noticed as I walked that my limbs seemed to be working completely under their own control.  As I walked my legs felt as if they were controlling themselves, and there seemed to be a very powerful force pulling me around.  If I would lean heavily to one side, the force would pull me back, as if I literally could not fall over, the force would not allow it.  The night was wonderful.  As I typed on the keyboard, my hands seemed to float, and perfectly coherant sentences would turn into incessant ramblings, or just random letters being mashed.  Yet they all seemed to make sense.
188	1	a	Since that night I have not been able to replicate that high.  I have also not been able to get my hands on anything better than shwag.  I am wondering if the weed that I smoked that night was possibly KB, but I have no clue.  All I know is that every high I have had since that night has been a let-down, and I long for the wonderful feeling that was present that evening.  I will continute to attempt to locate some high quality weed, and attempt to replicate that nights high.  If all goes well, chances are I will become a 'pothead,' but would it really be so bad?  =)

191	1	a	One day after a night of boredom me and mate who will be known as MW rocked up to a mates place looking for some billys. He gave us about a 20 worth of good hydro. MW chopped up and we proceeded to smoke away. We went cone for cone until the mix was over. MW said he had to get back to where he was staying and walked home. 
192	1	a	I stayed on the couch in my mates room and watched AUSTAR. As I sat there I thought Âwow he talked up this hydro a bit, I think im gonna go and get a drink.Â But when I tried to move I was stuck to the couch. I shut my eyes to try and focus myself and thatÂs when the rollercoaster experience started. I felt as if I was flying along in the rollercoaster, banking up turns, flying down hills, slowing to go up slopes and I must admit I was really enjoying myself. This continued for about half an hour until I reopened my eyes. I had a cigarette after my body could move again. My mate came in from whatever he was doing  and I told him about what had just happened. 
193	1	a	He said that the pot did the same thing to him today. So we chopped up again and smoked another session and proceeded to ride the rollercoaster  Again. This has never happened to me on any other pot and I must admit it was the first hallucination I'd had off pot and it was a great one.

196	1	a	So every weekend I  smoke a bunch of weed with my friend Jordon. I have a big house, and its easy to smoke in my room when my dad falls asleep. So one weekend, I had two other friends come up and smoke, one brought about 2-3 grams of hydro, and me and Jordon had 3 grams in Indoor KB. After smoking a good 80% of all of it, I took the biggest hit of my life. The weed cought on fire, the flame was pretty big. I got the whole bowl down in one hit, and then my whole body went numb. Then things went hazy. 
197	1	a	The next thing i knew, I was around seven feet tall, wearing a plaid brown suit, and I had a beard and hair down to my knees. I hate on big glasses, and i was being interveiwed on CNN becaus ei had discovered fossil fuel. I was interviewed for a good hour and a half, answering a bunch of questions and drawing up graphs. My friends said that during that entire time, I was speaking in complete jibberish. I either was saying random words and numbers, or just making strange noises.

200	1	a	This story is actually about a friend of mine (G) who suffered from acute depression, and had a long history of depression and suicide attempts in his family. He is extremely chemically dependant, as both his parents formerly were. 
201	1	a	What happened is that I bought a quarter, when this stupid kid called looking for a quarter and a dime, so I sold him that quarter which was skimpy at that for thirty-five dollars. I know it is a bastard move but it is some limp-bizkit kid that walks around calling people fags. I got the thirty five bucks and then called up the dude I got the quarter from, said it was a little skimpy, and asked him to sell me a half for 35. Well, he didn't give a fuck as we are friends, and then I took the half to a party at my friend J's house. 
202	1	a	There were about eight of us smoking, and since I was packing for the time being, they made me smoke a bowl out of the bong to myself. Then we proceeded to smoke most of the half, and found that it is the most potent shwag/mec that I have ever smoked. I had no problem smoking a lot of it cause it was so cheap. We were all unbelievably fucked up. 
203	1	a	My friend G, the depression guy, got higher than any of us. He also gets depressed when really high. He went home and decided to take two bottles of tylenol, 48 pills. I woke from a deep slumber to G's roomate calling and wanting to know if G took any acid or shrooms or anything, because G was puking red and delirious. I said get him to a hospital fast, and found out about the whole incident the next day.
204	1	a	He spent a couple weeks in the psych ward and on the whole fucked up his life. Anyone smart would see this as a cue to stop, but the day he was out of the hospital he took to smoking cigarettes again. The first time I saw him once he was out of the hospital, he was drinking. Two days later, he was smoking pot again. He ended up having some fucked up hallucinations due to some medication he was on. He is now back to smoking tons, and I have no doubt that he will kill himself one of these days.

206	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Depression (15), Second Hand Report (42), General (1), Not Applicable (38)
207	1	a	It somewhat started a day before the fourth of July. Raz and I had the idea to hook our computers up over at his house because his parents would be gone. Then we could play Warcraft 3 for all hours of the day. Then, the fourth of July rolled around, and I went to bed around four-thirty. The next morning I awoke around one to the sound of the vacuum. At first I became disoriented, thinking that it was Thursday, we no longer had cleaning ladies, and my mom should have been at work. I let it pass and went back to sleep.
208	1	a	Then, I finally rose from bed at roughly three p.m. and walked outside my room. Chaos abounded. My mom was cleaning the house for some unknown reason before it clicked that it was the fourth of July. She sees me...first thing I get instead of a 'good morning' or whichever greeting applies was, 'Weren't you supposed to do this?' I tell her I was going to clean the house tomorrow (Friday), and ask who ask coming over. She replied to me with, 'Charlie and Cynthia....your dad invited them...' I asked her why I hadn't been told this and she gave me this trip somewhere around the lines of, 'You knew damn well they were coming over...' and I laid things out for her. Simply, I did not know. I asked her several times before what her plans were, hoping they would leave the house. Everytime I got the answer, 'I don't know, nothing yet.' Apparently, she recalled differently. I gave her the usual rounaround: 'Whatever...I didn't know anything about it and I planned on cleaning tomorrow.' Then, very pissed  as I was, I went back to my room.
209	1	a	I got online and IMed Raz with a message that went something to the effect of, 'Let's get this bitch started.' He then told me to get my computer rounded up because he'd be there shortly. I quickly got off, unhooked it all, tossed it into my bag, and prepared to wash my face and bursh my teeth. I had not time for a shower, so I merely tossed on my hat and wore exactly what I had on the day prior. As I was getting ready I noticed all sorts of items lying around that pissed me off to all extents. Crazy fold over calendars containing biblical references and passages. Pictures that had been thrown in am obscure drawer for ages, toiletries in the bathroom that I did not know we posessed. 
210	1	a	I then had it in my mind, that I would never become this. Scurrying around, cleaning things, throwing up items that would hopefully give others a false impression of myself (be it one I hoped to obtain). This simply would never be me. I then had it set in my mind that if my dad told me to either clean up my room or possibly take the Grateful Dead sign from my door, I would begin a speech that would rival that of the Gettysburg Address. A monolouge so compelling it could be contained in a coming-of-age movie staring Colin Hanks or Josh Hartnett. I had it all planned out in my head, the entire scenario, it was so rivveting I actually began to hope he would request these things of me simply so I could give this performance. My mind was reeling: 'Dad...I'm not going to do such things. I'm not going to run around the house picking up every magazine and shoe so it appears that we live a way we do not. I'm not cleaning my room or taking the sign off my door. That's who I am. Most of your other friends know who I am...to varying degrees. I'm not going to hide myself in a lie that will hopefully please your co-worker and his wife. If they don't like that my room is dirty, tell them to close the door. 
211	1	a	Also, if I find out that you took the sign off my door, and I will be able to find out if you did...I will lose a great amount of respect for you that I doubt will ever be regained.' It was incredible. But sadly, it did not happen.
212	1	a	All I got was, 'Do you want steak or hamburger?' My reply to him was the news of the LAN with Razgard. He then told me to be careful if we got fireworks. I said we wouldn't get them...and then the doorbell rang. I opened it to find Razgard's smiling face ready to kick off and play some games. We loaded up and left for his house. We got there, set it all up, got a game ready to go, and then decided it was time to smoke some fat bowls. We grabbed the supplies and headed out to the backyard. Mind you it is no somewhere around 4:45 and 5:00 and I had not showered or eaten since the day previous. 
213	1	a	We smoked two...maybe three large bowls of hydro, and we were toast. This is the kind of high many people experience let alone with someone else. We began to walk back to his room for a rousing game of 'stoned WarCraft 3'. As we go inside I feel the cold air blast me with a nova strictly aiming for the heat arising from my body. My body is sent into a minimal form of shot. The El Nino of temperature combined with the lack of food sent a straight overkill to my brain. Instead of my stomach screaming and crying for sustance my eyes go out. It works just as that. A small pixel of black suddenly swells and amasses an army of grey and black squares that engullf my vision, very similar to a fire diffusing through an entire forest. Now, instead of seeing the home and furniture that was before me, I saw a swirling and caccophany of light greys, dark greys and blacks impairing any vision I may have once had. I was not scared though. It was somewhat entertaining and it had happened once before, so I knew the procedure. I was hot..then cold...and hungry beyond any feeling I have had before.
214	1	a	I debate myself for lingering seconds that tick away like hours. Then I decide. 'Dude...I'm fucking blind.' I comically exclaim. Raz is somewhat worried. I can sense it. They say that when people are blind their other senses become heightened. I can attest to this. I then tell him that it would quickly pass, because it was beginning to. 
215	1	a	The darkness was not as searing and it was leaving in the same form it arrived: A raging torrent collapsing upon itself. I then sat down and we began to play some WarCraft 3, stoned out our skulls. Then, as I slightly lean forward to find the nearest gold deposit, the hatred returns. My vision dies once more and I slightly turn to where Raz was at and I say, 'Dude...I need something to eat.' So, I feel my way around, looking out of what little splotches of vision that still remain and make myself to the kitchen. He points out to what they have, and I reach for the Simpson's Pop Tarts. Little did I know, I had actually grabbed a packet of popcorn. He laughs at me, as do I as I slightly read the words 'Pop-sec --' on the package. He then exclaims, 'Fuck man! Are you going to be alright?' out of pure worry after discovering the true magnatude of my condition. 
216	1	a	I relay the story of last summer with my brother when the hunger and heat teamed up to deliver a finishing blow to my sight. I also make sure to point out the comedy of the situation, because my brother's friend's father was there and told his so to, 'Stay away from that stuff,' that he, 'better not be doing that stuff.' We both laugh at this as we go to sit down in the living room. My vision is still greatly fucked for lack of a better word. We watched a little TV but I still noticed I was hungry. I was at approximately this moment that Razgard brings up, 'Hey...do you still want that Pop-Tart?' I, having totally forgetting about it in the thirty seconds since we last saw it exclaimed, 'Fuck yea! I forgot.' We both laughed at this for what lingered on to be five, maybe ten minutes. Then, we went to get the Pop-Tart. I asked him if I could have it toasted, as a warm, gooey Simpson Pop-Tart tasted much better to my mental senses than a cold, not cooked Pop-Tart. We put it in, and he heads back to the living room. I, awaiting for my proverbial 'knight in shining armor' lean against the counter staring down the heated death coils of the toaster, fearing for my snack's life. 
217	1	a	I contemplate whether or not I should save it from the metal and spring coils of death and simply eat it as it was. I then realized that it actually enjoyed being in there. The toaster was what a sauna is to us. I then smiled for him, and let a small tuft of noise pass through my lips as I nearly began to talk to it, before noticing Raz standing by the kitchen entryway, laughing at my giddyness for a Pop-Tart. Had he only known the connection we had. I was staring at him, totally oblivious to the Pop-Tart that once engrossed my every braincell, before *CHINK* the toaster exploded the toasty Pop-Tart back to it's original position, as I too exploded in a fit of fear, anger, and chaos as I did not expect the noise. My partner began to laugh at my antics, as I said, 'Fuck man...I'm going to enjoy this fucker.' I then stepped out into the garage of his home to claim a drink for myself. A Diet Lemon Coke. My meal was complete, and my blindness still intact mainly in the center of my vision. 
218	1	a	I could see the outer edges of my periphriel vision, and I used it to my full advantage. I then made the journey back to the living room to fulfill my stomach's every fantasy.
219	1	a	We turned on the TV as I ate what was the most delicios Pop-Tart in my life, complimented perfectly with diet coke, hinting slightly of Lemon. Now, being the stoners we were, we both knew very well of the odd coincedences that happen when we're stoned and watching TV. The most fucked up programming is available to us. Things that would never claim the television cables had you not been stoned. So, flipping through the channels we notice several of them, somewhat distant from each other were showing very similiar images, the kind that accompany 'breaking news' or 'top stories'. 
220	1	a	After we both noticed this and decided it was possibly something of importance, we searched frantically for one of the several stations carrying the images. After we had finally arrived on the scene of the news program, we slowly learned of the shooting at LAX airport. The caption read, 'Three dead in shooting incident.' Not sure what to make of it we watched, and then, as wrong as it may have been, laughed until we were very short on breath. The comment taking blame for these fits of laughter? 'We believe it was nearly a personal problem, nothing more than that, although we have contained all those that were in the airport.' I am still not sure why this was so humorous as it was, but I believe it was due to the conversation we had about Grand Theft Auto III days before. 
221	1	a	An incident very similiar to the one that occured in real life, happened to my friend in the game. He was running around the third island (the only island with an airport) when he found a few people walking around. He nonchalantly pulled out his shotgun, shot them both dead, and then ran for a random truck. After this had taken place I began to talk about how things of this nature would never happen in real life. One man would not randomly go somewhere, shoot two people, attract all manners of the cops, secret service, SWAT team, and any other law enforcement agency. As I was saying this, he ran into a woman who, before being shot, screamed, 'Do you have a diet soda?!' So, naturally, as everything I had mention the night before was present in this news story, I took it upon myself to yell through the house, 'Do you have a diet soda!?!' in my best woman voice. Again, we both died of laughing fits.
222	1	a	Deciding that this news story was not the best thing to watch, we set out in hopes of finding something far more entertaining. Not until I stumbled upon FOX that we saw what would become the most fucked up episode of Fresh Prince ever. We were in the middle of the episode, having missed the first half, but provided we were deeply invovled in the dialouge, we slightly caught on the what was happening. Apparently Will and Carlton mad a bet where Carlton goes into the hood for a while and tries to survive. To cut a very long, drawn out, insane episode short, Will goes to get Carlton out of the hood fearing for his safety. When he (Will) arrives there, Carlton is dressed up in all sorts of 'fly' gear, with a bandana over his shaved head, and some gold on. He then spouts out some of the usual gang/hip hop terminology, containing, but not limited to 'homey' 'Sup?' 'fronting' and many others I fail to forget now. This had set us both into a primitive state of shock, confusion, and humor all at once. Not sure to laugh or say 'What the fuck?' we simply did both.
223	1	a	Next we opted to see else became of the shooting at LAX and I continually mashed buttons on the remote, hoping to press the correct combination that would give us a news channel. I finally opted for merely typing in '4-1', '4-2', '4-3', etc... I then began to debate with myself why I did this instead of pressing the 'channel up' button. Still unsure of my actions, I continued to climb the channels in this manner. We were unable to find the correct station, although we did find some Junkyard Wars. Thankfully, we were slightly descending from out mental mindfuck of a stoning, and we were able to watch and concentrate on the show. Between laughing and watching we made many references to what a team of stoners would do had they been involved.
224	1	a	Provided you're unaware of the premise to the show, they take two teams of three, give them a certain challenge, then give them an expert in the field. Of course, the tiwst is that everything they use to build must come from the junkyard the provide. The challenges range from boats, to hovercrafts, to wind-powered cars, to tools of destruction. Luckily for us, the episode we were watching was the finals of the season, so they had to destroy a hundred foot concrete wall. 
225	1	a	Anyway, back to our jokes. Many times we told tales of how the stoner team would just weld a bong to their contraption, or simply make a scrap-heap pipe instead of what they were supposed to make. Then, Raz pointed out that on their white board for ideas and model designs, they would just have pot leaves and 4:20 scrawled all over the place. I then added that one of them would say something along the lines of, 'Dude...do you think they have anything I can eat around here?' and another one would say, 'Wait...weren't we supposed to be doing something?' Naturally, we decided it would be the best rated episode ever. Finally, the show was over, and we headed back to the room for WarCraft III. We began to play several games, each getting our asses handed to us by the insanely difficult computer opponents. We laughed and cursed and mainly blamed it on the drugs. Suddenly, things took a turn for the odd. A knock on the door could be heard, then the opening of said door. We knew very well who it was, but we weren't ready for what they had in store. We were playing and who comes through the door? 
226	1	a	It was damn BMF (Bad Mother Fucker) and a damned Ox. Naturally, both of their nicknames were changed to protect identities and/or possible misconceptions about their nature. One of the first things to come forth from BMFs mouth: 'Hey...you guys want some tabs?' Jesus Fuck! Why must they have dealt us these cards? Of course we wanted tabs damn it. We'd do tabs any time of the day. So, we had a short conversation, gathered up money, told the orders, and then waited. At this point that the two friends that just joined us were on Crystal Meth. So...we weren't too sure what to expect. I was debating whether or not to do the tabs that night, but after I found out that others would be and it wouldn't be me alone, I went for it. Just then, two other friends showed up, these two of the opposite sex. Sicily and Fuck-Up walked in for reasons I'm still not sure of. 
227	1	a	I don't think anyone knew why they came over or how they knew we were there, but nobody cared either. So, we all sat around talking before Ox claimed he wanted to take another 'bump'. We then all went to the kitchen, because to put it frankly, you don't see someone rail some Meth everyday. Everyone took their turn, sans Raz and I, he too afraid he would like it more than he should, and I...well I don't know why. Ox then told me that I could have some if I wanted, but that would be the only time he would ask. He also filled me in that no matter what he had, if I wanted some I could ask and provided he had enough, he's share. 
228	1	a	Ox is a really nice fucking guy. Raz and I went back to finish up our WarCraft III game, got our asses kicked, then went back to the living room. We all sat around talking some, then a few went outside to smoke while BMF and Sicily left to go get our rolls.

230	1	a	Raz and I yet again play some WarCraft III before deciding we should just hold it off for now and get some music ready. We begin to set out our musical collection for the roll. We also picked up the room some so we wouldn't break shit. Then we headed out to the living room to watch TV and chat with those still around. Finally, BMF and Sicily finally came back with the goods. Just like one of the three wisemen, BMF sat down, opened his little baggy, and showed us the sixteen rolls he had gotten a hold of, as well as the relatively larger amount of hydro. Splitting them up into baggys and passing them out, BMF then told us that he was going to someone elses house to hang out for a bit, as was everyone else. Minutes later, Raz and I were the only ones around again, but we still had a friend on the way. About half an hour later, maybe a full hour, Grunge showed up with his girlfriend. His prime motive for the visit was to play some WarCraft III, so I got it set up for him and watched him play. Then, quickly and quietly one o'clock stopped by, and we got a phone call. The others had dropped their pills. It was now our turn. Taking a cue from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas I turned to Raz and said, 'As your attorney I advise you to follow me into the bathroom.' It was not one-oh-five, and we were going to digest our disco biscuits.
231	1	a	We did the deed and went back to the room to watch our friend play our game, when shortly, another person showed up. Track (I just gave her the name...she runs track, no allusion to heroin, something none of us did) stopped by to hang out with us for a little while because nothing else was going on. Soon enough BMF came back while the others stayed where they were for a while. Around this time Grunge left because his girlfriend was tired and he thought her better off sleeping at home than around a collection of people she didn't know. 
232	1	a	So, now it was just Raz, Track, BMF, and myself. Again, another twist comes up. Having a few extra X's left, BMF attempts to coerce Track into rolling with us. Her only real reason for not wanting to was having to work the next day at four and being tired, but BMF still tried. I even threw in a little taste of my own, simply because I like peer pressure. I know, it's twisted. But I laid off, because I only wanted to make one little comment. Soon enough I found myself back with the computers playing some excellent toys I had downloaded. Then, I began to get restless. We had our supple of straws and water, which I carried around with me most of the time because I like water. Of course, I made the mistake of setting them down several times and losing them for extended periods of time. I would walk around the house with a stride of determination, spouting off lines like, 'Where the fuck is my goddamned water!' or Jesus Fucking Heral Christ....I just want my cursed water!' Track told me to get another glass and it would be alright, but I prefer to have what I started out with. 
233	1	a	If i just gave up on the first one I had, what would stop me from losing a second? A third? Hell, soon enough I'd have lost all the glasses. Aside from that there was this pestering tingle in the back of my mind just wondering where this amazing hiding spot was. Soon enough I found it by the TV from when BMF and I tried to get some music going in the DVD player. Having wanted to go outside for what seemed like hours, I finally said fuck it to everything, took a leak, and went outside to smoke with BMF, notebook in my hand. I had it in my mind that I would roll and draw and/or write. I had a great cigarette and talk with BMF about just how cool I thought he was, his reciprocated comment, art, clothing, people, all the usual. Then I started to talk and draw, and he told me that he wanted to go inside for a while. I told him that I'd stay out there for some time, and that he could join me again if he wished. 
234	1	a	As he walked off I asked him for another cigarette incase I wanted one, and out of generosity he gave me the rest of the pack. Granted it was only three, that's still real fucking nice. He also ensured me that if I ever wanted any more that I could ask him and have as many as I liked. I'm no a big smoker, but that's just damn nice of him. So, there I was, on a trampoline, out of my mind, with a notepad and minimal light.
235	1	a	Previous message was not received because of error (8:45:51 PM): Your message was refused by the AOL Instant Messenger server, probably because the message was too big. Try making the message shorter and send it again.
236	1	a	We did the deed and went back to the room to watch our friend play our game, when shortly, another person showed up. Track (I just gave her the name...she runs track, no allusion to heroin, something none of us did) stopped by to hang out with us for a little while because nothing else was going on. Soon enough BMF came back while the others stayed where they were for a while. Around this time Grunge left because his girlfriend was tired and he thought her better off sleeping at home than around a collection of people she didn't know. So, now it was just Raz, Track, BMF, and myself. Again, another twist comes up. Having a few extra X's left, BMF attempts to coerce Track into rolling with us. 
237	1	a	Her only real reason for not wanting to was having to work the next day at four and being tired, but BMF still tried. I even threw in a little taste of my own, simply because I like peer pressure. I know, it's twisted. But I laid off, because I only wanted to make one little comment. Soon enough I found myself back with the computers playing some excellent toys I had downloaded. Then, I began to get restless. We had our supple of straws and water, which I carried around with me most of the time because I like water. Of course, I made the mistake of setting them down several times and losing them for extended periods of time.
238	1	a	I first began to draw what I had imagened the other day. It's something I want to possibly paint out of whatever provided I get back into art (I had told BMF the entire story about how I felt out of interest with art and hoped to maybe get back into it all). Realizing that low light and trying to draw while speeding didn't work, I settled for my true enjoyment. Writing. Now, I'm not too sure how the rest of the writing went out. This was all done in the dark, on a trampoline, speeding, with possible effects of the X taking hold. I present you now with the writing: 
239	1	a	'Jesus...did I fuck up? No inhibitions left. My affidavit of responsibility chewed up and digested in pill form. What have I done to myself? Is this me? Or did I forge an alternate being in my thoughtless actions? Will I ever get the chance to figure it out? So many goddam questions....Do answers exist? If I did lay my ignorance to waste, would they be true? Is it possible that the knowledge I learn is only crafted by a cunning orator greater than myself? Impossible. There is no being greater than a mind. If truths are revealed it's simply due to my own intelligence. Fuck! My perception has been torn from its sanctuary. In its place a beast so powerful....I am unable to tame the godforsaken spawn of synthetic evil. Goddam...creatures lurk in every crevice my mind is aware of. Fucking bats and wolves --' 
240	1	a	This is as far as I got before my mind went blank. When I write I prefer it to flow and entangle rather than forcing myself to get something to work. At this time, I headed back inside.
241	1	a	Once returning inside I found Tracks sleeping on the couch (sleep is something she did often), and the others back in BMF's car with the heater on and Things Fall Apart by NIN pounding the speakers. I joined in, trying not to disturb them too much, spill my water, or drop the cigarette from behing my ear, but the latter wasn't working for me. I pulled out a lighter in hopes of finding it again, but wasn't able. Not until I got out did I find it and place it behind my ear again. I went back inside, then to the trampoline to jump. Somewhere around this time I went back to the computers to search for something to do, although I was inevitably unable to find it. I then went and laid on the floor as I always do when the others came back in. We conversed wondering if anyone was feeling anything, but nothing came about it. We tried everything in our desperate measures to kick in the roll but couldn't find anything sufficient enough. 
242	1	a	Somewhere around this time we decided to join the others at Monster's place, sadly, they too were unable to roll. Track left for her apartment, I imagine it was to sleep in her own bed, and we gathered up our things and went to Monster's. The drive there seemed like it took hours while in reality it was merely ten, maybe fifteen minutes. I nearly smoked the cigarette I had behind my ear before losing it on the floor again. NWA was rapping throughout the car as I blindly searched for the lost cigarette, again my obsesive-compulsive similarities kicked in. Finally we made it to Monster's to find Ox and Sicily in his truck blasting the heater. I on the other hand went to the house door, tapped it a few times, then walked in. 
243	1	a	I looked around at Monster and Fuck-Up, the only two inside now, and exclaimed my well rehearsed line in the car, 'So...this is where the mighty [name here] resides.' He laughed a bit, then concurred with my statement before I set in for my next line of dialouge (also well rehearsed), 'So...I know I just got here, and not wanting to come off like a dick or anything, could I use your bathroom?' Once more he ind of laughed and directed me to the second door on the left stating, 'It's a trailer, not too hard to figure out.' I then, once again, went to the bathroom, pissed off because I was still going to the bathroom. 
244	1	a	If only I was rolling, my ability to drink massive quantities of water and not urinate would have been intact. I then stepped outside and sat next to Spin (For lack of anything better to call him, merely the first part of where he works) and started talking to him. He took was on one of the pills we took, but like the rest, wasn't feeling anything. I smoked a few bowls with him and talked a bit before going back inside. After Sicily went back outside I claimed a spot on the couch next to Fuck-Up and began talking. Fuck-Up was waiting to roll the next day with some others in a big city, but after she saw how everyone else faired, she was thinking about not doing it. Monster on the other hand....he was pretty fucked up from the shrooms he ate. We sat around watching VH1-Classic while all manners of friends came and went outside. We had a small conversation about what we dubbed the 'bunk ass pills.' We had two tips and six people attempting to roll. 
245	1	a	We all started off with tryign the same one because it was rated the better roll. By this time though, pretty much everyone had one of the first, and then had just taken one of the others. Raz and I split ours up. A few of us decided to go back to Raz's place, because Monster needed some sleep and we just wanted to roll. I rode over there with Ox, smoking a cigarette on the way, while listening to the godlike Mr. Bungle. I suppose the half hit me a little as I felt good and the music was excellent. Then, just as the first, the minor feeling was gone. Ox told me he felt the exact same way. We finally went inside and were bitching about the bunk ass pills. By this time it was about 4:15, maybe 4:30, and none of us could sleep. In the house was Sicily and Spin, Ox, BMF, Raz, and Me...the six that took the rolls. 
246	1	a	Ox was real fucking bored so we decided to watch some of NIN And All That Could Have Been. I got up a few times to go back to the computers, humoring myself with google searching such as 'kicking in a roll' 'making myself roll' 'bunk ass pills' 'I took some bunk ass pills and I'm not feeling shit right now'. I found one crazy writing from someone, highlighted a passage about dancing pink elephants, and left it there for someone to see. I then went back out to the living room, where apparently everyone was talking a turn running off the shower.
247	1	a	By now, we all knew we weren't going to roll at all, and started to watch movies. It was something like 5:30 all of a sudden, the sun was up, and we were all pissed about the bunk pills. BMF ensured us that things would be taken care of and we would either get the money back for the pills or we'd get new ones to replace those. This made us all happy. We then began to watch Hackers, and about halfway through, I went to go join BMF on the trampoline to just lie there. We talked about how it was really pretty outside and smoked a few bowls to further enjoy it. I then went back inside, caught the end of the movie, and sat there while Ox selected Eyes Wide Shut for out next DVD. By now Raz was in a back room, BMF was still outside, and Spin was sleeping for work. Ox, Sicily, and myself were going to watch the movie. 
248	1	a	I had seen bits and pieces of it on TV and thought it was fucked up, but I was never ready for the shit they put in front of me. It got very fucked up, then Ox (He had seen it several times before) went to smoke a cigarette while Sicily sadly exclaimed, 'Dammit...right when it gets really fucked up I have to wake up Spin for work!' So, now I was alone, trying to comprehend the shit that was flcikering before my eyes. It ended, and I dug it, although it was so insane. Now, BMF was inside, Sicily and Spin had left, and Raz was sleeping in a room. Ox and I were the only ones left up, me by a miracle, and him by a bump of Meth not too long ago. He surprised me by putting in an unknown cassette that turned out to be old school Tom Green Show when it was still in Canada. Boy did that blow my mind. 
249	1	a	Tom Green is a fucking moron, but he's funny about it. Somewhere into the video BMF sauntered out to watch with us. It ended, and another one was put in. A second hour of madness. After all of that the time was something like eight o'clock in the damn morning.
250	1	a	When the videos finished, BMF went back out to the trampoline and Ox but in an Xbox game and played. I watched him for a little bit, then went out to the trampoline. I laid there for a while, having some very weird closed-eye visuals that I can only claim to be from the lack of sleep. I mean, the rolls would have worn off somewhere around four or five, but it was eight in the morning. So, I just layed there for a while, then got kind of hungry and went to make some more Pop-Tarts. I made my poptarts and ate them while Ox did something on the TV that I don't recall. It was either still the game or just some show, I wasn't paying attention. 
251	1	a	After I finished my poptarts and helepd BMF look for his phone some...not some...we looked for the better part of half an hour, maybe forty-five minutes. I finally found it when I went to go get my notebook out of his car, noticing his phone crammed into his boots in the back. I gave it to him, he checked his calls or whatever, and then we went back out to the trampoline. We laid there for some long length of time, and the next thing I noticed was BMF going inside. I then realized I must have fallen asleep, but for how long? A minute, an hour? Six? I went inside to talk to BMF about it and he said that he had just gotten up to go inside and told me, but figured I was alseep. I image my slumber as somewhere near ten minutes. Then I laid down on the couch to watch some more game playing by Ox and BMF. 
252	1	a	I watched about the second round before dozing off and coming to at what I imagine to be the third round or so. I look at the clock in the kitchen and it's 1:00 p.m. I then fall asleep again, this time when I wake up it's 1:30 and I notice Monster sitting there in front of me. I shout out, 'Jesus Fuck! I fall asleep and wake up with fucking Monster in front of me...that's insane.' I then fall asleep for a little longer, waking up when they're leaving to get some food at a place where they can sit in a booth and smoke. 
253	1	a	I tell them I'm going to stay there, as it's 2:30 already, and they leave. I then look at TV and see the paused game showing they played a total of twenty matches...I was asleep for a long fucking time. I almost started to doze off when Raz walked in, kind of asleep. I relayed the message about them going off, and how it was now 4:30 and we both slept a bit. He had to go meet up with Grunge later to go talk to some guy, and I needed to get home anyway. By the time we finally got around to it and got everything packed up it was 5:30. We then headed back to my house where he dropped me off with all of my stuff and headed out to see Grunge. 
254	1	a	I hauled everything inside, found a note saying my parents were gone out to eat, then I noticed my hand was all inked up. I searched my pocket and found out a pen had busted. I now had ink on everything in my pocket, including my hand. I don't know what it could mean, but I thin I'm owed some fucking Karma for this fourth of July.

258	1	a	I've been high before, but this was the most beautiful experience i've ever had. We were sitting around the circle and after getting stoned decided to put on pink floyd as usual. Then one of my friends said, 'Give this cd a chance.' The name of the cd was 'El Cielo' by a band called Dredg. We began our musical journey, the music is so haunting it's nearly impossible to describe in words.
259	1	a	I completely spaced and felt that the music only improved my high nearly two fold. Suddenly, I felt as if i was traveling, it felt like I was moving at lightspeed al thought it was apparent i was sitting still. I was immobilized. Completely paralyzed. I felt the sonic waves shining on me almost like the sun. I was no longer experiencing the music I was feeling it or even experiencing it. Now i've probably listened to the album nearly 100 times all the way through, and sometimes when I'm sober, this album even gives me a flash back high. I will never forget the first time I experienced music asopposed to just feeling it.

262	1	a	My girlfriend and I were hanging out and listening to music.  I believe it was led zep.  But recently I have been really concentrating on controlling my body and mind.  I havent ever researched meditation or anything of a sort, so thats why I'm not sure what the hell happened.  But here goes:
263	1	a	I was lying down and was pretty damn high.  I concentrated on the music in some sort of way I cant really explain.  I let the music consume me and let my imagination run wild.  It brought me to a place with laser lights and stuff.  I close my eyes and all of a sudden a feeling came over me and I felt like I dropped down.  It was like I dove down into a place.  The feeling was intense and really unexplainable.  I didnt want to leave this place so I concentrated on exploring it.  I never had a real picture in my mind, but what I felt made me think I had a picture in my mind.  I cant remember what I was seeing, but it was amazing.  I opened my eyes to see my girlfriend next to me.  She said she could see my pulse in my neck and that it was beating to the music.  I didnt try to ever do this again just because I dont know if I can.  It was that... crazy.

266	1	a	Well, I was sitting around my house thinking about what to do because my parents were gone for the week.  I decided to call up a few guys and toke a bowl or 4.  Friend A and B came over and we toked in the backyard.  It was some really good weed, but thats typical for oregon.  It was one of those 'one nug' eigths.  Once we we're extremely high, friend B started playing super mario 64.  Me and friend A decided we'd go out to the drum room in the garage to play some music.  I got on the drumset and Friend A got on the guitar, even though he didn't play!
267	1	a	Now, I'm a pretty good drummer sober, but when I'm high, the playing of drums takes on this spiritual, intense quality.  The drums sounded just perfect and the sticks felt like natural extensions of my hands.  I put on Tool's new CD 'Lateralus' through the headphones and played to it.  To my disbelief I hit everything exactly.  For some reason...my ability to percieve the timing of a song increases incredibly while high.  The beat naturally nestles itself in my mind and stays there, allowing me to improvise naturally over it.  Also, my mind strays to these complex thoughts about the 'importance' of my playing, and the general 'coolness' of hitting drums with sticks in different patterns.  Also, my creativity levels are at an all time 'high' will high (excuse pun).  My brain seems to be able to spontaneously come up with ideas more readily when stoned.  This all goes for the guitar too.  All the little riffs and techniques that are slightly beyond my sober grasp allow themselves to be played when im stoned.  Odd timings, emotional influxuations, almost sexuality permeate the guitar and amplifier.  
268	1	a	I can definately see how many of the world's most respected musicians are High 24/7, because of the incredible creative power THC seems to impart.

270	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
271	1	a	Cannabis usually makes me one of two things each time I smoke it.  I either get real excited, not nervous but my mind is clouded and has a hard time thinking.  If I donÂt get the above stated, I get deeply relaxed, muscle tension fades, and it feels as though a door has opened and my brain expands until there is ton of open space around my current thoughts.
272	1	a	One such experience was last Saturday.  Two friends of mine named Scott and Russ (nicknamed S and R for easier reference) bought some bud and got high before heading to the mall.  We packed a few bowls, two namely and smoked then rolled a blunt with the rest of the weed.  Between the time we smoked our bowls and rolled the blunt, I was feeling slightly giddy and giggly, yet not high.  We rolled the blunt and smoked it to where we couldn't hold it the put it in the bowl and finished it off.  I went to stand up and I couldnÂt.  I was feeling as if air was as heavy as water and I could only move my head really slow.  When I did finally figure out how to move my head again, it seemed as though my head stayed still but my body and the world are the ones that turned....
273	1	a	We made it into the mall, neither one of us could stop smiling.  We were walking around when I was hit with an instant of personal realization.  IÂm not talking about just getting messed up and heading to the mall for kicks.  I instantly realized how big the world actually was.  It felt as though time for me stopped but everyone else kept going at the exact same speed, I caught a glimpse of everyone past the mall doing their daily lives.  I stopped and took a minute to thank god for letting me see such things and experience such a nice life.  For about twenty minutes after that, it felt as though my mind and brain were two different things.  My brain seemed to take control of my body and move it for me while my brain laid in the back of my mind and enjoyed the ride... I was doing the same.
274	1	a	Somehow I reached the food-court and we chilled for a little bit at a table when I was staring at S and he was talking in a weird language and telling me to buy a book at Wal-Mart without moving his lips.  I asked him what he was saying and he told me I was hearing the Skytron monitor.  The Skytron was a huge TV above the food court that played constant commercials.  Anyway I stopped and watched the beautiful scene and let my worries fade when R looked at me and asked me if I heard the robot.  I was hearing a constant sound for a while now, not realizing it was a robot till R said something.  Normally I would get freaked out about something like this and hate myself for smoking bud.  This time I said , 'yeah' and sat back and relaxed and lived/loved life for what time I had left till the robot came to kill me.  It never did.
275	1	a	I came to realize later on that the robot was nothing merely other then the large jumble of voices eating their lunch and enjoying their life.... that made me happy to see that other people were enjoying their day also.  I was coming down from my high by the time we were leaving the mall, however that didn't stop Russ, Scott , and I from enjoying a laughing fit in the car so hard it made my chest hurt.
276	1	a	Smoking weed is fun... I believe it's something for everyone to try at least once and see how they like it.  As with beer, if I find myself getting messed up once a week or more, I'm going to cut back.  I have such a fun time each time I smoke the sweet herb, and I encourage everyone to be safe and have fun.

278	1	a	Let me start off by saying that I have been smoking cannabis and using many other substances off and on for about 6 years of my life, and I have yet to come across any bud that was this potent ever again, and maybe for the best.
279	1	a	It started on a Thursday night at a friends who I had agreed to sit for while he took a pretty high dose of DXM and Dramamine tablets (somewhere around 700mg DXM and 20 tablets of Dramamine). Well about two hours after taking the combination he wanted to go across the street to a friends and chill with some people. To my surprise he could actually walk without any problems whatsoever. Anyways, when we got over to A's house, there were 5 other friends over and they were all passing around a blunt and about to pack a bowl. They asked me if I wanted to smoke a bowl, so I agreed and went to sit down with them. I was the first to hit the bong, and I didn't want to get really high so I only took 1 hit. 'Only 1 hit, what could that do?', I mistakenly thought and later found out. Close to 10 minutes after my hit, I was feeling it come on pretty fast, thought it wasn't the usual cannabis high, it had a *weird* vibe to it.
280	1	a	So, I decided to stand up (usually helps when I'm feeling ill) to get rid of the nausea that had suddenly swept over me, and sure enough, it went away with no problems. I was coming up VERY fast and it was VERY intense. I wasn't really comfortable with the surroundings I was in so I asked my friends to watch B, my friend who took all the DXM and dram., while I went for a walk to clear my head. Well, I ended up walking home. The whole way home I was hallucinating all sorts of weird bugs and animals all around me. At one point on the way home, two old men standing next to a truck asked me if 'I was in the bar tonight'. I don't know if this had really happened so I just ignored it and kept walking my usual route home. About halfway home, every little spec on the road looked like a bug running around in the street, and I kept seeing bats and strange birds flying through the air above me, all making very strange noises similar to cars passing by on the highway. When I finally got home, I started fading in and out of consciousness, without knowing it until my body would 'jerk' and I would awaken.
281	1	a	I suddenly got nauseous again so I stumbled to the bathroom to vomit, but nothing came out. While I was sitting at the toilet, still fading in and out of consciousness, I thought I was standing in my friends backyard drinking malt liquor and kept saying 'I think I need to start heading home in a minute, the rice cakes will be ready soon.' Then I kinda 'popped' back into reality still feeling very nauseous. I never actually threw up, but came very close. Then next 40 minutes or so were spent sitting down at the toilet, falling in/out of reality, and falling over and hitting my head against the bathroom wall. When I finally came down enough to get up and move, I looked into the mirror and saw myself wearing a GIANT orange sombrero; very strange. When I moved into the living room, I collapsed on the couch and passed out until the next morning. And yes, I got a very good nights sleep.
282	1	a	For all of you who read this and think, 'cool', its was everything BUT cool. It scared the hell out of me. The whole time I had this overwhelming fear similar to the fear you get when on acid. On top of that, the stomach pains through the whole experience were terrible. And the friend who I was supposed to be sitting for, freaked out that night and went running naked through the neighborhood looking for his 'necklaces'.(it still amazes me that he could walk with no problems) But I hope this report helps those of you out there who think that there is no such thing as 'one hit shit', cuz there is, and this was by far, the most intense experience I've ever had with cannabis.

284	1	a	My name is Yuna, 16 and currently in 11th grade.
285	1	a	I'm a good kid. I'm smart, I go to school and respect elders. But I also do things that some people don't think very highly of.
286	1	a	Cigarettes. Alcohol. Pot. Speed. Ecstasy. Acid. Coke. Morphine.
287	1	a	I've never had a bad experience smoking weed in all the times I've done it. And it's pretty often - I usually smoke 2 or 3 times a week on average. Sometimes it's with friends and sometimes it's not. I buy from an ex of mine and he always gets me good stuff. For the most part, getting high is a nice experience.
288	1	a	Last week, I had my first bad trip. It had been a unusual time for me, I hadn't smoked any weed for about a month. It wasn't planned or anything, I just didn't find the time for it. Some of my brother's friends came over with some weed and asked if I wanted to smoke with them. 
289	1	a	I had always heard to never smoke weed from an Asian. And to that point, I hadn't. Even though I'm Asian myself, I never fit into that hoochie-ghetto-wigger kind very well and out of my group of friends, I'm really the only one who isn't white. But my brother is one of those gangster kind of Asians who only hang out with other gangstery Asians. I assumed the weed they brought was probably bleached or laced but I didn't think much of it. And besides, it had been a while since I had gotten high, so why not?
290	1	a	They rolled a fat blunt out of about a 30 of weed. We started passing it around the 4 of us and I was taking really big, monster hits. I wanted to get as much out of it as I could. I had about 10-15 big hits off of it, and a few shoties. It probably wasn't the greatest idea. I'm a tiny person. I'm only 5'2 and dont even make the 100 pound mark. But by then, I was too high to think about it too much.
291	1	a	At first, I was having a great time. I was really high and feeling really good. It lasted for about 20 minuites, when I started to get nauseous. I went into my room to lie down for a little bit, hoping it would take the nausea away, but it only got worse. I turned on the air conditioner full blast and stripped down to my bra and panties and tried to calm down. My heart was beating too fast and I was sweating like mad. I curled up on my bed and closed my eyes and tried to fall asleep but it didn't work.
292	1	a	When I had my eyes open, the entire room was spinning and twirling. Whenever I closed them, I got the strangest sensation that I was rolling foward, off my bed, even though I wasn't. I couldn't move the slightest bit or I was hit with extreme nausea. I couldn't even throw up because I hadn't eaten anything for a while. There were times I felt that the piece of my bed that I was lying on was hovering midair somewhere and things were flying around me. And I was overheated like crazy.
293	1	a	I'm not sure how much time passed. Later, I found out it was 45 minuites but it felt like hours. I eventually passed out and woke up an hour later, still feeling a bit nauseous but better. I drank some water and took an asprin to make my headache go away. I still had slight nausea for the rest of the night, but I wasn't burned at all. I made it okay.
294	1	a	But I'm never smoking weed from an Asian again.

297	1	a	Not long ago, my brother-in law scored a dime or two of good reefer from a guy at work.  I had come to visit, and he mentioned that he's like to try it (being less experianced than myself). Lacking rolling papers, the only smoking apparatus I had was an old 'zeppelin' on the floor of my car. after sharing a few hits each, we were feeling pretty good, starting to get a little buzzed, and the strangest thing happened...time slowed down!  I'm not talking about normal slow stoned, this was serious.  From what my sister reports (she was sober, watching us), a normal 5 minutes seemed like 4-6 hours to us.  Our thought processes seemed extremely fast, but breaks in the conversation were unusually long. Overall, we were probably high for the better part of 5 hours, but I can't begin to describe how long it felt.  I've never experianced this effect from Cannabis.  
298	1	a	Fortunately, the high was rather smooth, and not at all uncomfortable, but there were some strange side-effects that went along with it.  My bro got some serious munchies as a result of the stuff, and ate a whole jar of peanut butter.  I on the other hand had a single bite of chocolate cake, followed by the sensation that my mouth was 'glued shut' (BTW, the cake was REALLY GOOD!) the strange part is that my mouth was actually wide open, and my face was completely paralyzed. I found that I could neither move my jaw, nor feel anything touching my face during this time (an hour or two after smoking up).  I also felt very much disconnected from my hands, and motor dexterity in my fingers became sluggish, and delayed almost to the point of uselessness. these effects took about 3 hours to subside, and the next morning, I still felt somewhat stoned.   I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else.

300	1	a	Cannabis (1) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
301	1	a	I got a call from my friend one night, lets call her Betty Sue. She called to say that she was over at her Neighbor's (Sue Bee) House. Se told me to have my mom drop me off immideately. I could smell a good amount of almost sweet marijuana at the doorway. My mom didn't smell it. I sat down in the house and had one small hit from the bammer filled joint Betty Sue was smoking. it was definitetely not enough to have any  sort of effect, but it was the kind I could stay  up all night smoking for a good alert buzz if I had enough. We went out to get some food and shared a few more hits of bammer. By this time, the bammer wasn't having any psychoactive effect, but I could feel cottonmouth coming on, so I at least knew that when we smoked enough, there would be a pleasant mild high that I could enjoy. 
302	1	a	Sue Bee broke out the 'Blue Box' full of her stash. there was a sandwich bag full of bammer and I got excited, but there was one more thing. Green Bud. Now I had had green bud before, but this had a very stoney smell, Sue Bee said that it was new and real good (by the way, sue bee is about sixty to seventy years old) so I opted to try some. The taste was very sweet, probly what I had smelled coming in. We began passing around the pipe, filled with a full bud (enough to fill the bowl) and we refilled after a few minutes. I tried to hold it in, but it made me cough too much, which I didn't expect because the smoke was very very smooth and light tasting. And for a while, I noticed nothing. The onset was about five or ten minutes longer than normal. 
303	1	a	Finally it hit me. I didn't really come up, I actually hit the plateau immideately. I first noticed that I was in fact high (at the time I couldn't remember how that  felt and I couldn't actually feel anything, I just knew I was high) I started to remember what pot was usually like, and noticed that I did  not get cottonmouth like I do with the pot I usually smoke, and I had certainly never felt this clear headed after smoking so much (these were huge bowls, I had way more than one or two hits) I decided to stand up, and I noticed a slight swell in my limbs that spread to my whole body. Like I was being filled up with blood. I felt very heavy, I noticed that when I jumped, I only got about three inches off the ground When my jumping was usually about a foot normally and two feet when I am high and it feels like I am flying (It was probly a foot every time, my perception just changed) I eventually at down and let it fade. 
304	1	a	I would like to experiment with this type of green bud again and write a more thorough report and try more things. I would also like to examine it for other  plant material such as california poppy (I have noticed a similar effect mixing california poppy with damania).

307	1	a	Well, I figured I'd write this down in here too while I'm here and high both at once.
308	1	a	I started smoking the wacky tobaccy the summer after freshman year. 
309	1	a	I remember Maggie filled up a bong with stems she had left over and told me to smoke it, showed me how and said that it wouldn't get me high but it would put thc in my system so i'd  get really baked the real time i do it.
310	1	a	but as i was walking home from her house, I began to feel as though the street was rising and I was walking upwards.
311	1	a	Now i feel like im floating and letting my body come down a bit from the air so that i can type on the keyboard. or something real nice like that.
312	1	a	I notice that even though i ponder things when im not high, that's it's nothing unusual for me, its easier for me to do it right now, and my thoughts flow easily, they just click and connect like a puzzle.
313	1	a	i guess the brain power must shift from all the parts of the brain to specific spots....like from the part that governs memory to the part that governs thought processes. I dunno.
314	1	a	Sometimes I actualy become aroused when I smoke weed, which is odd. When one thinks of marijuana one does not think of being horny.
315	1	a	I get the munchies bad. I eat everything in the house. Like I can't get full and my stomach is rumbling. I think if you have cancer or aids or some other chronic (no pun intended) disease that depletes your hunger and makes you underweight, this can be a good thing, along with the pain relief.
316	1	a	For me, I have OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) which is an anxiety disorder where I can't quite worrying about stupid things no matter what anyone tells me, like if i am afraid that my hands have germs on them, and i freak out, yet I know it's not possible, the fear and such is so strong that i cant ignore it and wont believe my own mind. 
317	1	a	So when I smoke, I feel relaxed and light, and thinking about my fear just doesn't process in my mind, because it's too filled with the goodness of the leafy greens^^

319	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Health Benefits (32), General (1), Unknown Context (20)
320	1	a	Okay, I had only taken weed 3 times before this experience. It might be weird but I don't know, somehow the first two didn't have any effects on me. Of course it had some, but at least it wasn't as I had expected.
321	1	a	I got a friend, E , who's been smoking pot for over a year. He would come to school so high, wouldn't listen to the teachers, and stare around foolishly. He would tell me about the experiences he had while smoking weed and finally these made me try it.
322	1	a	Before marijuana, I had only smoked cigarrettes and taken alcohol, so I was a bit anxious about what could happen to me. The first time I smoked one joint, and honestly NOTHING happened to me. As I didn't get what I wanted from marijuana I wanted to do it again. That was a bit better and I felt high. But again, not as I wanted.
323	1	a	And here it comes..One day, E told me that his friend had got some strong weed and asked me if I wanted to go over and get high :) I couldn't say NO, because I wanted to have that feeling of highness so much. So we went to his house, prepared the bong , and started hitting.
324	1	a	1.. 2.. and I started feeling strange.. I was acting so different, I realised. But I could say to myself that 'I'm not high' 'I'm okay'. But with a look at the mirror, I saw my eyes half open, and bloodshot. I was having so much fun, we were listening to rap, and dancing wildly. I felt a little tired and sat on E's bed. He was sitting beside me singing. I lighted up a cigar and it's smoke got into my eyes, it hurt me so much and my eyes were all watery. I kept them closed for a few seconds and as I opened them THE WHOLE ROOM WAS FULL OF WATER.
325	1	a	I could see bubbles around the room just like I was in a pool or a sea. Things were floating and so was E's hair. Suddenly a blue shark, just like a cartoon passed behind E. I stared at it for a few moments and tried to realise what was happening. The shark made a few curves and faded away and I blinked to see it again but as I opened my eyes, everything was gone. I was in the room again, E was sitting there and staring at me blankly.
326	1	a	When I told him what happened , he was in a kind of shock because he had told me before that he hadn't ever had any hallucinations before so he was kinda jealous. It was a great experience, but I can't say anything about whether it is good or bad to use marijuana as I'm new. I just can say that it's fun!

329	1	a	I come from Germany so I guess there will be a lot of mistakes in the whole context - I want to appologize for that first. Okay I have to admit that I smoked weed a lot of times before but because I am not a smoker I really didn't get that high (because I didn't inhale it that deep and that long). I wanted to give it a last try because I really thought Marijuana is just boring and I couldn't imagine why people like that small not very intensive kick so much.
330	1	a	Me and a friend used about 0.5 g weed with tea. First we heated it in a microwave - then we started drinking it. Actually I tried to take weed oral like 2 times before which failed both cause I didn't eat it at all or I forget heating it - whatever this time should really be the last if it doesn't work... It was midnight when we used it so I know we should have got one hour left before it will have an effect on us but I doubted it anyway so we headed to Hanover City. It was an early Tuesday morning and nobody was on the streets when I first felt that something must have been changed - it was kind of more interesting and funny to look in all that windows of the closed stores.
331	1	a	Then we entered the station and it really went further very fast. So after a short while all was very funny and ridicolous. Walking was getting a problem because it was very hard to use one step for the other. Then we left the station again and get outside. We tried to talk to some people but we weren't able to do it - we only could make some noises and our converstion was getting more and more difficult maybe every 10th word was kind of sensible. 3 guys realized us and started laughing about us because we were behaving like robots - we just made noises and keep on walking. By the time one of them get the idea to rob us I got an unpleasant feeling and we went back to the station (btw we must have been crossing that station maybe 50 times that night!). Now I lost time and place control I mean I forgot in which direction we were heading and I wasn't able to speak one sentence because every time I forgot the beginning so it was no use.
332	1	a	To find the right way and walking itself were that hard that a short distance seemed to be like a long travel - the same with the time.By the time that I realized that 10 minutes really didn't pass by I got in panic and I was like: 'Does it ever stop again and all will it be okay? Maybe the drug dealer used some LSD on the grass and I will get mad...'
333	1	a	By that time I really felt like going to the hospital especially as we get so thirsty and the mouth were that try I can't tell...I was on heat and I didn't know wether I will get an heart attack or maybe I couldn't breathe anymore - but we found a book store which were opened by night so we entered it. We have been there like some hours before but there it was just cool. I just told the woman we only want to rest and get some drink and we won't make any trouble but then I saw her using the telephone - I got the paranoia that she would call the police... 40 minutes passed by and some people were supervising us - I realized it although they must have thought I couldn't take notice of them. My friend was sitting on a chair trying to read a book what of course was impossible - we didn't talk a lot anymore... I was walking and walking and walking arround the furnitures and talking to myself that I really don't have fun anymore and I want it to be over by now...
334	1	a	I wasn't that hungry anymore when I got the idea that my friend must be the devil because he rejected recognizing me and only sometimes I felt like he was back when he said: 'It's all cool - nothing to worry about'... suddenly two police men arrived and I got really angry cause that dumb woman really called them so we tried to leave the store and the police men were cool so all were cool... now I started coming down but then my friend wanted to drive and I jumped out of the car and took his keys cause I was afraid to die so we just hang out about another hour before I could accept driving home... after all this trip was really high and the following trips we made were more or less good but there were none what I would call a bad trip again... if I wouldn't have had that experience again I probably wouldn't use it anymore but now I really learned to use that stuff and we really had much fun but this is not the topic...

336	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
337	1	a	This happened two days ago...it was such an unusual experience, I thought I'd share with you guys :)
338	1	a	I've been smoking cannabis for about three years now, so I'd say I'm pretty experienced with joints, bongs etc. Anyway, I was in college around 11am, and met up with a long time stoner friend (lets call him Harris) in the student union. I mentioned I didn't feel like going to lectures that day, and he suggested we have a waterfall each.
339	1	a	If you don't know what a waterfall is, its usually a plastic soda bottle (in this case 500ml). You punch a hole in the bottom, put a gaze over the top, and put the cannabis in that. Then fill the bottle with water (cover the hole!), and burn in the cannabis as you let out the water. Then suck in that white smoke baby. Result: Some seriously good pure hash. Anyways, we had one each (I hadn't had a waterfall before), and decided to head outside on the campus lawn (gorgeous weather). After about 5 minutes, I could tell this was gonna be a strange buzz. Sounds were getting a little distorted, and everything seemed to be moving and sliding around slightly. About 10 minutes after taking the waterfall, my mind just clicked, and suddenly I was really, really trippy! I really can't describe it, but basically my mind was absolutley racing, new thoughts coming into my head every few seconds, and every ten seconds or so I just had to tap myself on the shoulder metaphorically, to remind myself where I was and who I was.
340	1	a	I looked up in the sky and saw four airplanes, two heading one way and two the other. I suddenly panicked, and said to my friend 'This is it man, it's World War Three' - The airplanes looked exactly like missiles - nukes on their way to their respective targets. It was really creepy, because it honestly felt like this was it, nuclear war.
341	1	a	Luckily, after a few minutes this feeling went, and I just went with the buzz, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Maybe it was the pot, maybe it was the waterfall, but it was simply the most intense buzz I'd every gotten off cannabis.
342	1	a	So, what did I learn? Well, its hard at first, but I think you just have to let go...don't try to control or stop the intensity, because it only turns it into a bad buzz. Try to remain relaxed, and just melt into it. My mistake was to try and keep a grip on who and where I was - My tip, don't.

345	1	a	I started smoking a couple of months ago and have since become a more laid-back person who feels more at peace with her life and the world.  Marijuana is so commonplace and such a part of my life now that I hardly think of it as a drug, yet I have had a couple of experiences that were definitely mindblowing and reminded me that weed is more than food.  I had heard people speak of seeing sounds and feeling colors, etc. when they were tripping off acid, etc. but I never believed that such effects could be triggered by marijuana.
346	1	a	However, not too long ago, me and a couple of friends packed a bowl with some really potent KB and after about three hits I was really tripping hard.  I was sitting in a car in a parking lot at night listening to trance music.  My eyelids were drooping and I could not move my body at all, not that I wanted to.  The music was enthralling--I could actually see it.  Everyone knows that smoking makes music better and I definitely appreciate it more when I am high, but seeing music is something else.  It was as if each facet of the music, and there were probably at least twenty--the bassline, the main melody, that strange clicking noise in the background, etc.--every noise took on a visual shape.  I could see every line of the music moving and dancing to its beat.  It was beautiful, absolutely breathtaking, until one of the shapes--a pink ball of light--began circling my head repeatedly.
347	1	a	First I was dizzy, then I became nauseous and my friend laughed as she changed the song because I was groaning that the music was making me sick.  Who would have thought you could see music and feel its effects?  Ever since this experience I have better recognized the beauty of music when you are high, though never again have I actually seen the sounds.  Marijuana enhances all the senses though, and on other occasions I have felt lights.  Driving down the highway at night, the streetlamps seemed to stroke my body and the feeling was intense.  In conclusion, marijuana is a wonderful substance that can open your body and mind to otherworldly experiences.

349	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
350	1	a	At about eight oclock I met my friend, whom I'll call Kathy. She and I walked to a small wooded park, where earlier that afternoon we'd found a perfect place to smoke. We arrived at the designated area, I packed a bowl, and we lit up. We got about two hits apiece off each bowl (I packed them really small because I knew how potent it was) and after the third bowl, we decided to stop. I was feeling a little buzzed and Kathy said she wasn't really feeling it at all. So we packed up the dope, the flashlight we'd brought, and the lighters and set out for the road. 
351	1	a	However, as soon as we stepped off the small concrete platform where we'd been standing onto the grass, it hit. Everything that I looked at was very, very pixellated, as though I were looking at a low-resolution digital image. Each separate part of my body, especially my hands and feet, felt like they were in different, discrete planes of existence. All of my senses, except touch in certain cases, were incredibly heightened. I especially remember thinking that my hearing had been augmented. I was twitching, slightly. I was so unable to judge distances that I didn't trust myself to light a cigarette.
352	1	a	However, without a doubt the strangest part of this whole experience was the way in which I perceived reality and the passage of time. For at least two and a half hours (in real-time...For me it seemed like days), I had a feeling of unreality. At first I thought I was dreaming, but I realized that that didn't quite cover what I was feeling. So I thought some more, and the best explanation that I can come up with is that I felt like I was an image on a movie screen...That I was a physical piece of a movie that someone else was watching. I had a pervasive, at times frightening feeling that nothing I did had any consequences because none of it was real. 
353	1	a	In terms of my awareness of my surroundings...It's difficult to describe this without being really confusing and roundabout...The way I saw and thought about things was very similar to any movie or movie preview or something where the editors take several clips of a particular scene and place them all one after the other, even though in reality five or ten minutes may have passed between each clip. I would exchange a few words with Kathy, then we'd both fall into silence for a moment, and then I'd look back up at her and realize that I'd completely forgotten she was there, and I would have no memory of just having talked to her. Usually for those first few moments of realization I'd think she was a hallucination I was having (eventually, that began really to unnerve me, so I asked her to hold onto my arm, which made it a little better, but I was still pretty startled every time I looked at her). I had many consecutive trains of thought, but they were all very brief and died out one after the other. So, the end result of all of that is that everything felt incredibly disjointed. 
354	1	a	That, combined with the fact that I felt like I was in a film, made last night one of the strangest nights of my life. I think I enjoyed it, though I think I would have enjoyed it more if Kathy and I had spent most of the night in a place where we knew we were going to be safe, such as one of our houses (both of our sets of parents were home, which is why we stayed out until it wore off a little, and that took about three hours).

356	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
357	1	a	This report is intended to attest to the extent that Cannabis is capable of putting you out like a light. One night, my friends and I decided to have a little jam session at a friend's garage. This entailed playing music with little or no actual cohesion, and smoking lots of weed.
358	1	a	Before entering the experience, I was not noticably tired. Keep this in mind. Also, I have a relatively low tolerance to weed. 
359	1	a	T+00 The first bowl gets passed around as we are setting up our equipment. The weed is of fairly good quality, and by the time we are all done smoking, I'm starting to feel fairly stoned.
360	1	a	We play music for a while. We have only one light in the entire loft, a lamp pointing straight up. This caused the surroundings to be either illuminated in light or cast in pitch black shadow. The intense contrast in lighting might have contributed to the experience.
361	1	a	T+90 I eat a meatball sub, and smoke more weed. I was VERY hungry at this point and wolfed down the sandwich. 
362	1	a	T+95 I finish sandwich and realize that energy level is declining rapidly.
363	1	a	We play more music for a while. I am still sitting on the couch as I have no inclination to get up, being very tired and very stoned. Starting to loose motor coordination.
364	1	a	T+140 We smoke yet another bowl, which in retrospect, given my level of exhaustion, was a really stupid idea. I still had to drive home, which fortunately was only 20 minutes away.
365	1	a	T+170 I bid my friends goodbye, and climb the ladder (we were in a loft) down to my car. Climbing down can only be described as choppy and unsteady, and I'm sure my balance was horrible at that point.
366	1	a	I had told my parents that I was going to be home by 11 as it was a school night. They are usually asleep by then, so it wouldn't matter how stoned I would be when I finally arrive. However, it was only 10pm. I had an hour to kill, so I figured I'd drive my incredably stoned and out of it self down to the beach parking lot, and chill out there for a while.
367	1	a	T+190 I arrive at the parking lot. It's now 10:20 and I'm still extremely stoned and tired, I make the foolish mistake of 'resting my eyes.'
368	1	a	T+310 (120 minutes later) I wake up, realize I am an hour and 15 minutes late, and zoom home. I had slept off most of the effects of the weed, and was feeling refreshed. 
369	1	a	Luckily, I didn't get into any sort of trouble for this incident. But, it did teach me that Cannabis can make one extremely tired, to the point of not being able to keep oneself awake unless one's eyes are open. Although random slumber is not necessarily a bad thing, I definitely think I should not have been driving that night, as I very well could have fallen asleep at the wheel. Be forewarned.

372	1	a	I was visiting the hippy town of Woodstock for the weekend with some older friends (most of my friends are over 30 and I am in high school). I suspected that pot might be part of the day's activities, but I wasn't sure if my friends thought I was old enough to become one of the stoner crowd.
373	1	a	We arrived at an art collector's house to hang out before we went swimming. My friend J pulled out his pipe, and a little box with a bud in it, and put it in front of me and walked away. I took it upon myself to prepare it and share it with everyone else. My first inhale was smooth, maybe because I had been around the smoke before, and my lungs were more tolerant. I held it in long, hoping to get some amazing high that is spoken of in movies and cloudy rooms. I took two more hits afterward, just to ensure some reaction from the stuff.
374	1	a	After we finished, we went to a swimming hole by the waterfalls. This was very cool. On the way there, I was hearing my favorite CD for the first time, all over again. Every sound was a perfect harmony to my mood. It was beautiful. The water was cold, and the reflections of light on the water got my mind to wander. I closed my eyes and thought about breathing underwater, and floating in a tranquil paradise. Somewhere in this stream of thought my parents came to mind, and I began to feel guilty. This was a major bring down from my high. I quickly deminished the thought, but I couldnt get back what was lost.
375	1	a	The day went on, and it wore off slowly. I was in a generally calm, peaceful state of mind for the entire day. I do recommend this stuff to everyone who likes to relax and dream, but only in moderation. In excess, this does no good.
376	1	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
377	1	a	I tried weed for the first time when I was in grade 8, when I was 13 years old. The first time I 'tried' it I didnÂt feel anything at all. After about 3 times of trying it and having feeling nothing, I felt that I had a different kind of brain than other people and that weed wouldnÂt affect me. 
378	1	a	One Friday during school my friend 'S', who has been smoking me the weed for the last few times, asked me if I wanted to smoke again. As I was still wondering about the feeling that weed could give me, I agreed to come over and smoke with him.  Between 4 people, we smoked two joints, and about 5 big bowls. I averaged it out later that I myself probably smoked 1 gram of weed. 
379	1	a	Like the many times before, nothing appeared different than normal life. I just went upstairs and got a drink of water. After I got my drink I walked over to my friend ÂCÂ and began to talk with her. I forget what we talked about, but one time during the conversation I went to have a drink of water from my glass, when I realized that I didnÂt have a glass in my hand.
380	1	a	ÂHey C, didnÂt I have a glass of water in myÂÂ HAHAHAHAÂ I began to laugh uncontrollably at the fact that I thought I had water in my hand. After what felt like 10 minutes of laughing, I turned to my friend ÂDÂ and yelled, ÂWhat is going on!Â 
381	1	a	When he said that, I immediately started to explore my surroundings, finally I was high. So THIS is what I was trying to experience. So THIS is what I was trying to experience. After that more of the weed kicked in and eventually I realized I was really stoned.
382	1	a	We than walked downstairs and sat on chairs in ÂCÂsÂ room. All of my other friends were talking with each other while I was sitting in my chair stoned off my ass. During the time I was sitting in my chair I kept feeling like somebody added weights to the front of my body, making it hard to sit up straight. I would fall over and than catch myself and sit up straight and look around the room. The whole time this was going on a felt bloated and close to throwing up. 
383	1	a	All of a sudden I felt that my mouth was extremely dry. I then realized, for possibly the fifth time, that I didnÂt have a drink in my hand anymore. I then told everyone in the room several times that I was going to get a drink, and finally I did.
384	1	a	I began to walk up the stairs and then all of a sudden I Âmind-blankedÂ into the kitchen. I felt like the trip up the stairs never happened. As I was in the kitchen all I could think of was how I got up here. Then as I saw the sink I remembered that I was looking for my glass that I had previously so that I could get some water. After I had found my glass I began to fill it up with water, which is when I had another Âmind-blank.Â
385	1	a	At one moment I was filling up my glass with water, at the next I was walking down the stairs and sat down in my chair. When I sat down I began to drink my water. Right after I started, my friends were laughing at me, I didnÂt know why and was tripping out to hard at them laughing to ask why they were laughing.
386	1	a	In between laughing, my friend ÂCÂ came out with the words Âsalt in your water?Â 
387	1	a	I then looked at my glass and I was murky. I then tasted my water and it tasted horrible. So I put it down in awe at what my brain did while I had no control over it. 
388	1	a	We sat in the basement for a while and then we had to leave. CÂs room was in the basement and her window was level with the ground so for fun we decided to climb out the window to leave. I had a little bit of trouble, but when I got outside I felt awesome. To this day I still enjoy being outside when IÂm stoned. I feel like I enjoy the natural beauty of the earth more when IÂm stoned. 
389	1	a	While I was walking I felt that my heart was beating really fast. Every once and a while, I would be walking by myself, and then I would run to catch up with my friends to walk with them. After that I would usually have a Âmind-blank,Â and I would be behind them and have to catch up with them again.
390	1	a	We walked around my town for a while and then I went home. I snuck in quietly and trying to act normal told my mom that I was going to bed. I turned on the TV in my room and watched TV until I fell asleep.
391	1	a	In the morning I felt a little ÂfuzzyÂ and still messed up but I could still think and function fine. After a while I became completely normal, and I was excited about what I had just experienced the night before.
392	1	a	It is more than three years later and I have been smoking a fair bit of weed ever since, about once a week, and always enjoy it. 
393	1	a	After my first time being stoned I have never had the Âmind-blanksÂ that I had that evening. My first time being stoned was a weird experience, a taste of the Âother sideÂ of life.
394	1	a	On a final note I would like to say to be cautious when trying weed for the first time. You may find things to be very unknown and messed up, but remember that you will be fine in a couple hours and that you will not die, as I thought many time during the trip that I was having a heart attack and/or was about to die.

397	1	a	One night I was at a friends house, and we had just got back from my sisters high school graduation. We all (5 people) went to my friends room, and lit up some great Boone (north carolina) Nug bud. It taste so good I could have died. I could feel it kick in as I took the first hit. We all sat and talked and laughed, but then Thomas took out a rolling paper. Oh, shit I was already in over my head. I didn't think I could handle any more, but it was just the kind of bud I couldn't pass up. Do you know what I mean?
398	1	a	Thomas started rolling it and showed us how to roll a ' mully' joint. It was so fucking funny. He was acting like it was an infomercial. We where all tripping out, he is so funny. Then we smoked another one and talked and laughed. But here is were the good part starts. Every one left the room , but I stayed in the room. The reason for this is I usually trip unusually to much. So, I stayed and tripped.
399	1	a	The first part was me sitting down in an air bubble chair. I was thinking of me just sitting on air, and that must have affected my trip coming up. Here it goes. I was just sitting there thinking of things, and all of a sudden I was blocked in by bricks. Not regular bricks but air bubble bricks (the only way to explain it). The bricks were like the bubble chair I was sitting in. I could not possibly move, the bricks were holding me tight. I closed my Eyes thinking I could lose the trip, but as soon as I did I got sucked into a portal. A portal of infinite knowledge (as always as I trip). I drift and drift. It was telling a story, and a great one at that. Life is great, you have to hold on to the moments and create new ones. I was literally taking deep refreshing breaths just to savour the moment. I can't remember every moment of this experience so I won't ramble. Every time I trip it is spiritual and I learn more and more about the actual world that surrounds us all. I hope you have liked this if you didn't have a wonderful day anyway.

401	1	a	Cannabis (1) : General (1), Mystical Experiences (9), Small Group (2-9) (17)
402	1	a	As a prelude to my journey into the water pipe dimension I must confront the reader with the facts that I have tried the sweet herb a good 10 or so times before and have used a gravity bong but not a water, and it was a great experience! 
403	1	a	The day started off cold and dreary.  I woke from bed and went to my friendÂs house.  The friend whom I was picking up just turned 18 and wanted to buy something to smoke out of by himself, so I told him I would take him to a shop that sells them; and I did.  One of the grayest and colorless days I have ever known passed by us on that trip.  Once we got there we selected a nice straight bong with about a 2 inch mouth piece.  It fit my mug nicely as it did his.  We made the trip home talking quiet a bit how hungry we were, yet we didnÂt stop anywhere at all to eat which was a blessing in disguise I guess, it saved us money.
404	1	a	The time is now around 1 pm and we are sitting at home admiring his new water bong.  Again it is just my friend Justin and I.  We still didnÂt think to get anything to eat when suddenly the doorbell rang and in walked my pothead friend Scott.  We could always get weed from him and today was no exception, we decided to buy and eighth and ended up smoking it in his car with the water bong.  Justin got the first hit and I saw him draw no smoke into the chamber and my doubts were starting to arise.  The bong went to Scott and he took one of the most monster hits I ever saw and didnÂt choke.  I couldnÂt wait to try it, and after what seemed like a day it came back to me and I settled it into my lap and put my mouth to it.  I prayed to have a good high and hoped I got really stoned off of the bong.   I drew a big hit into the chamber and cleared it expecting to kill myself coughing but it was so nice and smooth! The hit I took was almost like a cigarette! I should mention that this bud was nothing more then powerful oregano, really nothing good.... we didnÂt care though, it was working it seemed.  That is to say, it was weed but a very inferior quality as I judged by the mass amounts of seeds and stems, and just the way it smoked.  I went on and took about 10 hits off the bong and we ended up smoking the rest of the eighth.
405	1	a	The rest of the day was a blur but I remember the first of it, sitting in the car marveling how complex the scenery is when I realized I had no idea where I was.  I began to think we were near my house when I forgot why I was thinking what I was thinking.  I never had such bad short-term memory loss like that before.  I literally would think of one thing, and then either forget what I was thinking about in the middle of thinking it, or space out and just realize I was spacing ten minutes later.  I wasnÂt thinking I was high until right then and it just hit me I was stoned off my ass.  I couldnÂt do anything but just smile with a big grin on my face and giggle at nothing.  We were lost in the city for a while in the car, maybe about 45 minutes when suddenly I realized a road and yelled out of no where 'AAAHH HOUSE NEAR HERE!' I couldnÂt think of what to say and after a while it ended up we were nowhere even near the city anymore somehow, which to this day I can never figure out how that happened.  
406	1	a	So we headed toward another friends house that lives close to me.  His name was also Justin.  We relaxed there and I had some things to eat such as chips and ice cream. The second Justin looked a lot like Jim Morrison, especially with the hair and I kept thinking it was actually Jim and flipping out.  I could feel Mary Jane clutching at my brain, and it felt as though the weed lifted a blanket off my brain and I had so much more space for all my thoughts to go to now.... if that makes any sense.
407	1	a	We talked for a while and watched some TV.  The only other thing I can remember until that night is just staring at my friends face and watching it glow then turn into another friends face.  The second Justin turned on Any Colour You Like by Pink Floyd and told me to close my eyes and watch the colors.  That was a great show; it felt as if my body was being cut in half but in a pleasant way.  The feeling went up into my tooth and made my tooth feel fuzzy.  I then started to feel like liquid and the music made me feel as though my liquid self was slowly going upwards for some reason in a quelling motion.
408	1	a	I eventually came down that day but I had a lot of 'brain farts' I guess you call them.  For instance I went into a gas station, one is in my town, and another in the city over and they both look the same inside.  I looked at the soda fountain and all of a sudden I couldnÂt remember which one I was at or how I got there.  I asked my friend and he just thought I was saying that to make myself look still high, but I really didnÂt know which one we were at.  Then later on I was dining out, and scooping myself some sprinkles for ice cream and I dipped the sprinkle spoon in the hot chocolate by accident and just left it there and walked away while the people I was with were screaming my name, I knew they were tooÂ but I just didnÂt register  in my mind to turn around.  The rest of the night everything just seemed so cool and the world around me was such a nice place.  I had a wonderful long lasting feeling of euphoria long after it, and I still feel as everything is going to work out great.
409	1	a	Anyway, this about wraps up my first try on a water bong, and let me tell you it was the highest I have ever got.  Out of all my times when I got high, it was the best from the water bong.  I was also surprised at how easy it hits.

411	1	a	A brief substance history before the experience. Before today 2002 was the last time I had ever done drugs. I had been clean of any substance abuse for 15 years. My health has been getting the best of me for so long that I have been scared to do anything, much less have an eye opening experience. I made one mistake, and that was underestimating the potency of this strain. I was sick to my stomach for a good while before it passed. It was too much for me, and too strong. This weed was no joke.
412	1	a	With a blunt rolled by my brother ready we go outside and I spend a little time in meditation before I spark it up. What begins to take place while we are smoking this blunt is the deepest conversation I can remember having with anyone. My tolerance is at square one here so as far as you know this is like a first time experience. 
413	1	a	Within 10 minutes I am in another world. I am beginning to feel the effects of this blunt hit me like a ton of bricks. Everything I feel, say, and do begins to feel like a dream, but it's real life. Everything I feel, say, and do begins to feel like a dream, but it's real life. Me and my brother start having a deep conversation about things that nobody understands but us two. Out of nowhere I ask the question 'How have I made it this far?'. I promise you that I have never asked a deeper question in my whole lifetime and I have had 5 surgeries in the past 7 years, plus a near death experience with Pneumonia so I have came close to not making it a time or two. At this time I am bawling and letting so much out I begin to make myself speechless because what I am sharing with my younger brother is some real life stuff that needed to come out. After talking for a while longer I decide to take a nap because I am emotionally drained, and far away in another place. 
414	1	a	When I wake up from a short nap I decide to order a Pizza, and watch some LIVE PD. I enjoy my meal while laughing at folks on tv getting arrested for various crimes. 
415	1	a	Although this experience was rough, it taught me something. I need to be more open, and have more deep conversations with folks instead of being so quiet all of the time. It's hard to talk when life has humbled you on a level you can't begin to understand. For some reason I have made it this far. I have survived it all.
416	1	a	One day I will smoke weed again, but it won't be for a while. I have a great life, and I'd like to keep it that way.

418	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), General (1)
419	1	a	My experiences with marijuana are very similar every time, but very enjoyable. I decided I had to write this report about it because of the amazing similarities between my experiences and those of another user. I will use one experience of mine that had all the things I normally feel, only more extreme because I was more high than usual.
420	1	a	There is a girl that goes to our school who lives in a rather nice apartment downtown (we live in a small town, so downtown isnÂt much), but her parents were in Europe for a few weeks and she let us smoke in her apartment. On this occasion, she wasnÂt even home when we were smoking. But anyway I was smoking with my best friend and one of his friends, who IÂm also pretty well acquainted with. So we smoked almost an eighth, just us three, and I went to sit on the couch. 
421	1	a	Many times I meditate while high because I can focus more without distracting thoughts Many times I meditate while high because I can focus more without distracting thoughts, but this day I decided I was so high, I should probably just enjoy it. All my friends know that with me, I get high very easily, and I have intense highs. For whatever reason, my highs are in my head, body, and eyes at the same time. So when I sit still I shiver and shake and twitch, but also get distorted visuals. Well sitting on the couch I started feeling like the couch was falling backwards all the time, as if I was on a small, but fast ferris wheel going in reverse. I could actually feel the wind against my skin (I later realized this was an exaggeration of the wind from the fan above me). Then I closed my eyes and got some closed eye visuals, which are somewhat consistent with every time I get high. It seems to me that these visuals are of things I saw as an infant. For example, I saw my house, but it was an incredibly simplified version, with only one floor, and only one level of roof which slanted to the back. But it was most definitely my house. I think I was somehow remembering the way I saw or thought of my house when I was just an infant. I also saw a pattern that could either be an eye or a loose outline of a house, but that pattern appears in my head almost every time. 
422	1	a	Eventually I decided to return to my friends who were sitting at the counter together but both were very intently staring at the counter-top. So I got a granola bar, which was somewhat hard to chew but every time I opened my jaw the stickiness sent waves of euphoria through my body. It felt so good. Then I sat down again and decided I would travel down the rabbit hole. I closed my eyes and could easily visualize a rabbit hole. I pushed down through the hole by chewing, and those waves pushed the dirt aside. The rest of the day pretty much went on like this.
423	1	a	For the next few days I felt more refreshed and optimistic than I have in as long as I can remember.

425	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
426	1	a	Every month or so, I buy a bit of cannabis from a good friend of mine, usually 1/16th of an oz., as this time. I tend to consume all of it in a period of 3-4 days remaining under its influence from waking to sleep unless work or school get in the way. During this time, I tend to write, draw, tell stories, come up with plans, and all of the regular experiences associated with cannabis use. My 'Stoned Philosophy' has been subject of many jokes by friends My 'Stoned Philosophy' has been subject of many jokes by friends, but often enough they listen openly, assuming I am indeed speaking from more than a simply 'stoned' perspective. 
427	1	a	I bought from this friend of mine with the intent of having a regular time, as per my usual. Listen to music, write some stories, play some videogames, and watch some movies. After having been less-than-sober for many hours, I began to watch a movie. Across the Universe, a movie I had been wanting to see for some time, having been told by many people how wonderful it was and my undying love for The Beatles. John Lennon is one of the reasons I got into philosophy, in fact. 
428	1	a	The movie started out very strongly, and as I lit up another bowl, I started singing along to some of the songs that I knew, although the remakes had rhythms I was not used to. It was perhaps twenty minutes into this movie that I started seeing it as the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, a feeling I still hold some months later. The utter perfection of the 'humanity' in the movie made me weep several times. By the end of the film, I had decided upon what I wanted to accomplish with much of my life. As a college student, I have been slightly indecisive about my major, where to go in life, and what to do. The character Jude, although fictitious, finalized ideas I had been having for some time. I knew I wanted to work on the wrongs of the world, and the best way I see is to start from the ground up; what people think. People think by what they know, and they know by what they are taught. 
429	1	a	I am a History major, soon to be attending another year of college, in order to teach people in the same position I am the wrongs humans have perpetrated, the great things we have done, in hopes of bettering mankind. Something I think all people need to work towards. 
430	1	a	In all of my experiences with multiple substances, I have never felt so 'right' as I did that night. I have never felt so 'right' as I did that night. I called members of my family, telling them of my revelation, of my new insight, and every one of them has helped me in working towards this goal, which is still a long way off. Through cannabis induced rants, silly ideas, a completely irrational fear of Zerglings, and all other foolish, but fun, things associated with my cannabis experiences, 'weed' really helped me. I am happier now than I have been in some time, even with the constant stress around me. I know that, due to a simple little plant and a movie, life will be completely worth all the hardship just to pass on any knowledge I am able, to hopefully better our so often ignorant species.

432	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Glowing Experiences (4), General (1), Alone (16)
433	1	a	Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] 
434	1	a	It was a day pretty much like most others. I was still in high school at this point, hanging out with my buddies who I'll call N and C. After school ended I drove them both home before heading to work. When I was dropping N off he said, 'Pick me up after work, I got something.'
435	1	a	I figured he meant he had bought some buds, as we were all pretty much potheads by this point. I finished work (I do construction) and was tired and achy as I pulled into N's driveway. I picked them both up (C was living at N's due to familial problems), and we started driving down toward my neighborhood. We parked the car at the end of a road that went down to the harbor. The spot was relatively secluded so we got out and packed a bowl of weed. N told me he had found the bag in the school parking lot that day.
436	1	a	We sat on a piece of driftwood watching heat lightning while we smoked two bowls. I noticed the smoke had a sort of 'mentholish' taste to it... kind of cool and minty. But sort of gross and chemical. In any event, I didn't like it much, but I figured weed is weed.
437	1	a	After a short time we all became agitated, we couldn't stop shifting our weight and fidgeting, talking all kinds of nonsense. I could hear my blood rushing through my veins and feel my heart pounding in my chest. At this point I kept saying, 'Dude, I'm dieing man!' over and over again.
438	1	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
439	1	a	We wandered around the beach, a total mess, for a few hours. Then I felt safe to drive again and we went around our town, going into the village and parking near Town Pond. It is this little pond next to the cemetary near the ocean. We sat there watching cars drive by, I noticed the tail lights left behind blurs as they went.
440	1	a	I had never taken any drug stronger than pot or mushrooms before this day, and the experience was slightly frightening, but ended up being pretty funny too. I felt sort of numb and hysterical, like a weird drunk in addition to a spacey high feeling.
441	1	a	We all went home and I ended up laying around in bed feeling weird for a little while before falling asleep. The next day I felt pretty burnt.
442	1	a	We later concluded that the pot could have been laced with PCP after hearing about some similar baggies going around our school. This was my first, and likely only experience with this drug.
443	1	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
444	1	a	I've been smoking cannabis for the past few years now. I started when I was 15. I've had different kinds of trips but this one was what I guess a 'Trip' is supposed to be. 
445	1	a	A friend hooked us up with Malana Cream which is grown in Malana, India. It's one of the best quality hash you can get in the world. No kidding. We rolled them and we smoked. It was after the 4th Joint (Shared by 3 people), I was certain that I'm getting fucked.
446	1	a	Constant white flashes. Then white circles around the corner of my eye. Sound sensitive, that usually happens. I couldn't eat, it just didn't want to go down.
447	1	a	I had only slept for 3 hours the previous night which is obviously a big mistake.  I had trouble keeping my eyes open and I was a bit scared because one of my friends who is quite a sober person ate a few pieces of cake filled with 72 grams of weed and he was hospitalized after he fainted, haha. I obviously didn't want to faint and be hospitalized which kept me at bay. So I went home and lied down on the bed. 
448	1	a	Then I felt this sensation around my chest, I can't say it was a burning sensation. I don't know but in my mind it felt like something bright inside my chest in my mind it felt like something bright inside my chest. Then I felt like I floating above my body. Separated from my body. At that very point, it felt great. I never knew I could hallucinate like this on hashish. Though I have never done Heroin, Acid etc. I do remember telling myself during the trip 'Fuck I'm floating, really!' I was back and running after 30 mins then, though I felt pretty lazy through out the day.
449	1	a	There is actually one more thing which isn't really big but but its been 2 weeks since then and I have yellow light flashes out of nowhere. It has happened to me 4-5 times this week. Sometimes I feel like the earth is shaking or a feeling of losing balance I guess but I'm pretty much still. 
450	1	a	Today I did think about these yellow flashes and the earth shaking thing and its kinda weird. I thought about all those people who have spiritual experiences through drugs. I'm a non believer though. But it was well worth the trip.

452	1	a	Cannabis - Hash (93) : Hangover / Days After (46), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
453	1	a	I was in a party, an a friend of mine was smoking a joint. I gave 2-3 puffs from it, I wasnt a frequent smoker, just once in a while if someone offered. This pot was very pure, not the dried one, so it hit pretty hard, really quick. The party was really loud and I sat in a couch as I started to feel overwhelmed by the voices of everyone. I catched isolated words, but every word I heard was reminding me of a memory of a conversation I had with different people at different ocasions long ago, where that word was used. They were all memories from high school, at gave me a frightful feel of meaning and irreality.
454	1	a	I think I closed my eyes, I dont remember, just everything went very dark. I panicked everything went very dark. I panicked. The whole world had faded away and I didnÂ´t know what happened. I started to think of the reasons why this happened. First I thought I died and I felt bad for my parents. Second I thought maybe I became crazy and I wasnt aware of reality but I was truly institutionalised and I felt even worse. Then I started to feel like I was floating. I was floating in the dark and I couldnt feel my body. I was sure suddenly, the world had ended. Like it had exploded with some asteroid and that it happened so quickly that anyone had time to be aware of its own death. This certainty made me angry, bexause I was still conscious, and I'm not religious. To be aware after dying wasnt something I was expecting, and I felt annoyed by it.  
455	1	a	I started to feel like I was drifting, like falling, and I started thinking of everything that was lost, of everyone that died and that no one had time to say goodbye. I felt so alone and sad. I was cursing the fact that I still existed, I was so alone and afraid and thinking how much time is this going to last? Eternity? Will I join the others or is everyone alone in it one space like me forever? 
456	1	a	As I continue falling I tried to calm myself and I started to feel like I was falling through ÂmembranesÂ. I started to feel like I was falling through ÂmembranesÂ. Every membrane was a state, like I was growing or maturing, from one human condition into another state. As time passed and I continue to fall through this stage, I felt simpler, like a speck of dust lost in space. No longer feeling the need of everything I left behind in my previous life.
457	1	a	This lasted what I felt it was a long time, until a friend of mine shaked my shoulder and asked me If I was alright. I still had a shoulder. I opened my eyes. I had eyes. I was still in the party and my friend told me I sat there for like ten minutes. 
458	1	a	I was snapped out of it but still pretty high so I asked if I could go lay down in a bedroom. I was calm now because I knew it was just a trip so I fell asleep easily until it was time to go, a couple of hours later and I was feeling normal by then. 
459	1	a	It was a disturbing but interesting experience.

461	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Difficult Experiences (5), General (1), Large Group (10+) (19)
462	1	a	I'm a quite regular user of cannabis, I often buy half ounces and sort out little gatherings of a few people. 
463	1	a	I bought a half ounce for a night, expecting 3 people (including myself) to turn up, O and D. I got home with my stash and rolled up a big joint with about 1/4oz in it. Only O turned up, and we walked up a hill to one of our usual haunts, a nice hilltop bench with a brilliant view of the sky. It was around 8pm this time, and already getting hard to find the floor underneath the cover of trees. We sat down, and sparked up the joint. O took a few tokes on it before curling up on the bench. I proceeded to smoke the rest of it. We started talking about other drugs and whether we would or wouldnt do them, and then started looking at shapes in the sky. O rolled up another joint, just a kingsize one, and started smoking it.
464	1	a	Light clouds quickly flowed through the stars and the last of the sunlight died. 
465	1	a	As I neared the end of the joint, we started saying little things that just had us laughing for ages. I started thinking of everything good and bad in life, and then started to feel quite sick, like I'd drunk too much alcohol. This passed shortly, and then my right leg started shaking uncontrollably. O laughed, because I was shaking the bench, and then all of a sudden my left leg started too. We laughed at this for about 5 minutes and then decided to head off to a set of tennis courts in the hope that some other people would be there. We walked in, and lay down on the tennis courts. I stared straight up at the sky and started thinking of when I was a little kid; I used to stare up at the sky during the day, the white clouds against the blue skies. Now I had grey clouds against a black sky. I kept thinking of all the ways I'd changed, how everything had gone wrong, how all my aspirations burned and all my love lost. I'd grown up and I'd hated it.
1	3	a	+2:30. The next hour was spent trying to decide on and get to our next destination, eventually deciding to go to Draper, a city which had a really nice view of the Salt Lake Valley and many places to park. We eventually stopped at a church parking lot, and once parked her second period of memory recall began.
2	3	a	+3:25. On the way up to Draper, she discussed how her ex's mother was in a similar situation as her, currently going through a divorce and living with family there. She mentioned that her ex's dad had been abusive, and while mentioning in passing that her ex had also been abusive (a fact I did not know at the time), she chose to pick up where she left off. Her ex, Jeff, won a half million dollar lawsuit in high school, and as a result both his house and his car were fully paid off.
3	3	a	+3:45. She began discussing her alcohol problems, which she went to rehab for and eventually overcame, but that were very damaging to their relationship. By the time she had become pregnant, she had quit all drugs except marijuana and was loyal to him, never cheating or even talking to guy friends during this time. Her ex seemed to be ignorant of the fact she had changed so much for him, and didn't believe any of the changes would last after the child was born.
4	3	a	+4:15. The discussion then turned towards the abuse, and I was really proud of the fact she was telling me about this with the same straight face and calm features as her first memory recall. Physically assaulted several times, she eventually came to realize that it was a bad environment for their child and 3 weeks prior to Halloween moved out.
5	3	a	+4:25. Once again, she snapped out of the memory and began to make new connections. It was also at this time that the major decision she had set out to decide, what to do about her ex and whether to keep their child, began to form itself. She came to realize that whatever was good about their relationship early on was now gone, and they would never again be like they were then.
6	3	a	+4:30. We began driving back down towards another nearby city, Bluffdale, where we wanted to try and rest a bit since it was almost sunrise and she'd said she was sleeping at a friend's house. Discussing her revelation that things were over, I was convinced she had hit a turning point, and that the therapy had shown her which path to take: putting her ex in the past and moving on.
7	3	a	+4:50. We didn't sleep once we got parked in Bluffdale, though we did watch a news special from a few years back, Ecstasy Rising, that led to us discussing her views on the therapy. As Holly described it, this was like no ecstasy experience she had ever had, and she was amazed at how easy it was to look back at these memories without feeling the pain she usually felt even thinking about him.
8	3	a	+6:20. After talking and watching Ecstasy Rising, we left Bluffdale and I went to take her home. Over 6 hours had elapsed since taking the MDMA and I felt we had made a lot of progress this night, but she wanted to drop by and say hi to my parents first so we headed to my parent's house.
9	3	a	+6:40. Shortly before getting to my parent's home, her 3rd memory recall episode occurred, but due to the drug mostly having worn off she wasn't as prepared to handle it. Beginning to cry, she began asking why he abused her, how could anyone claim to love you when you beg them not to physically hurt you as they ignore your pleas and assault you so badly you fear for your life? We arrived at my parent's house and I was able to explain to her how this memory just reinforced the fact things would never be the same. If she went back, he would just beat her again, it would never stop, and this memory came to solidify her conviction to put whatever love she had for him in the past.
10	3	a	+7:00. While I hadn't taken it into consideration, seeing my family at this point was one of the best things that could occur to help her sort through the events and memories we discussed that night. My mother and stepfather are both very friendly people, and as my stepdad let me in he recognized Holly from years ago, giving her a hug and telling her how great it was to see her again. That he remembered her after only seeing her once over 2 years before caught her off-guard, and I could tell she was touched by this as well as the hug. My mother then arrived and welcomed us in, offering Holly a drink and a seat by the fireplace, then asked what we were doing out there at 8 am. Choosing to tell part of the truth, we told her about our adventures through the canyon, getting lost and ending up in Heber. Amused, she teased us about the fact neither of us ever sleep at night. My mother and Holly got along really well, and talked about gardening and eventually she told my mother she had a daughter. This also proved to be an unintentionally good choice, for my mother was a single parent of 3 during most of my childhood. They began discussing the difficulties of being a single parent, but as my mother made clear it was well worth the effort. My mom essentially picked up where I left off, telling her nearly the same things in response to the abuse he had inflicted and suggesting she gain full custody then raise her baby as a single mother. 
11	3	a	+8:45. We left my parent's home after nearly 2 hours, with Holly arriving home around the same time as they live within a mile of each other. She thanked me for the night, we hugged then she went inside to get some sleep. I found it interesting to note that, even though it had been over 8 hours since taking the capsule, I still felt the euphoric, peaceful effects of the MDMA quite strongly.
12	3	a	She and I talked the next day, and she told me once again that she felt like this experience was unlike anything she'd had before. To quote her exactly, 'I have been in therapy for 8 months, and I feel like last night did more for me than all 8 months of therapy did'. Over the next few weeks I noticed a definite change in her attitude toward life. Unfortunately, a month later she lost her job and the father of her baby was suing for full custody and planning to move out of state. She fell hard into using opiates, and was eventually admitted to rehab for heroin addiction. She's now gotten her life back together, and has joint custody with her ex, who never moved. Due to all the issues that erupted shortly after this therapy session, she has asked me to do another one, which we plan to do in the next few weeks, to help reinforce our first session.
13	3	a	While this experience report is told mostly as my own observation of another's experience, I chose to submit it because I feel this experience shows the benefits of MDMA psychotherapy, and as I took the same dose as her, this is a story about an experience we shared on MDMA. Holly reviewed this report and told me not to change a word, and specifically asked I post this experience report so people could learn the benefits of MDMA psychotherapy from her experience.

15	3	a	MDMA (3) : General (1), Second Hand Report (42), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Small Group (2-9) (17)
16	3	a	Not too long ago my sister and I attended a big event (a rave, if you will) in Los Angeles. We picked up the pills (two blue Mercedes) at a hotel about a mile away. I already had one molly (pure mdma powder) and a pink gun. The rave started at 7:00pm, and my sister and I decided to start walking there around 5:15 to get in line since it was such a big event. As we were walking, we already saw plenty of ravers walking there too, wearing the big baggy pants, beads, and giving light shows while walking down Figueroa. We finally arrive, and we saw much less people standing in line than expected. IÂd say there were about 200 people in front of us, give or take. So I thought to myself, ÂSweet, weÂll get in super early.Â So we patiently waited in line, smoking cigarettes, while people watching.
17	3	a	These events are all about freely expressing yourself, so you see a wide range of people. You mostly see the kandi kids, who wear tons of kandi (beads) and suck on pacifiers; however, anything you could possibly imagine youÂll see. As were standing there a group of people came and stood behind us. A tall girl with blond 80Âs rock hair came and she stood out for some reason. My sister and I were standing, minding our own business, and I hear a flamboyant gay guy talking behind us, so I turn around to find out it was the tall blond ÂgirlÂ we had seen. Also while standing in line I noticed a guy wearing a tutu, he was obviously rolling (it was easy to tell); all of a sudden he started running and I noticed another guy wearing a tutu. They run up to each other from opposite directions, jump up, and hug each other. It was quite a site to see, but we just looked at each other, shrugged, and minded our own business.
18	3	a	Now itÂs about 6:30pm and IÂm wondering why they were letting people in yet, since the event started at 7pm, and the opening act from was supposed to be amazing. A homeless black guy was pushing through the crowd saying ÂHash and Opium,Â trying to make a quick buck off some gullible e-tard. EveryoneÂs smoking cigarettes, some weed. The predominant age group of everyone I say was about 17-20, a lot of younger than one might expect. The line has barely moved. Some people are rolling. This one girl was walking up and talking to random people, while feeling herself and having involuntary jaw movements/teeth grinding (total signs of being on ecstasy). She even came up to my sister and complimented her hair, which is ironic because my sister was complaining about how bad her hair looked the whole day. Another guy was standing close to us, stomping his feet and chewing his gum fiercely. We could hear the rushing bass on the other side of fence and eagerly wanted to get through the gates.  
19	3	a	At this point more and more people are starting to roll, while in line, and so people start giving light shows. For some reason, these two small Mexican girls dressed as princesses really caught my eye. They were both wearing tutuÂs and tiaras, and every once in a while IÂd make contact with them but theyÂd look away really quickly. I couldnÂt tell if they were rolling or not. At this point the line keeps growing and people are starting to get angry, including me. I was sick of being stuck in a crowd of bunch of annoying drug addicts, where I literally couldnÂt even move my arms. I honestly wanted to leave at one point.
20	3	a	Eventually itÂs about 9pm, and I think IÂll be inside the gates within in hour so I decided to take my first pill, the molly. I knew it was cut with pixie stick (yes, the sugary candy) so I figured I would be fine, given that IÂd feel anything at all. For the next hour IÂm waiting to feel something, asking my sister repeatedly if my eyes had dilated at all. ItÂs just a little before 10pm, weÂre still in line and I start to feel a little different. I give my 33 year-old sister a big smile for no apparent reason. My sense of touch has changed. Being stuck between all these people is no longer annoying, but actually somewhat pleasant and comforting. I ask my sister, ÂAre my eyes dilated?Â She replies, ÂOhhhhh yeahhh.Â IÂm rollin.
21	3	a	I ask her to massage my neck, and the harder she massaged the further the eyes would roll to the back of my headÂthatÂs how good it felt. I closed my eyes while she was doing it and I felt like I was in a completely different world, it was like nothing IÂve ever experienced. It felt amazing. I told her, ÂI feel like IÂm a little kid again.Â And this Hispanic guy right next to us wearing a bandana over his mouth and those creepy looking contacts (the cat ones) looks at me and just nods his head, knowing exactly what IÂm talking about. I feel great and probably peaking at this point, but itÂs killed because we still havenÂt even gotten into the rave yet!
22	3	a	Finally I get checked by a security guard wearing a yellow jacket, he says to go on through. Next thing I know I see two other people standing in front of me wearing yellow jackets, one this short, stubby black female. I thought they were more security guards so I was extremely confused, and peaking, and tripping out. IÂm just standing there rolling balls, not having a clue what to do. ÂUmmm, your ticket?Â says the short black lady, followed by a loud burst of laughter only black women are capable of. I smile and think to myself ÂOh god, IÂm pretty fucked up right now.Â I give her the ticket, and catch up with my sister and we walk down this passage between to chain-linked fences. We were finally here.
23	3	a	The first thing my sister and I do is light a menthol cigarette and look around. Such a crazy atmosphere. Walking through the entrance was like stepping into a whole new world, especially from standing in line right outside for 5 hours. Everyone you see is on ecstasy, or whatever preferred substance, but most likely ecstasy. I see people dancing intensely, horribly in fact, but no one cares. People are just feeling the music and dancing freely by themselves. Other people are sitting on the ground getting light shows, some massaging each other, some just totally zoned out. The music at this point is sounding so intense and amazing I canÂt but help but put my arms up and literally just feel the music. I look around, everyone is smiling. Some people, random strangers, stop and say hi before walking to whatever their destination may be. ThereÂs no hate. Everyone is respectful of everyone else, no matter how crazy he or she might be perceived in the Âreal world.Â The energy and atmosphere I feel at raves like this is something IÂve never experienced anywhere else and doubt I ever will.
24	3	a	At this point I need to hit the bathroom and get some water. So my sister and I enter the arena which is swarming with drugged up kids. We head to the concession stand which I expected to be packed, but there were only one or two people in front of us. We get two waters. Then I go to the bathroom while my sister waits and then vice versa. While sheÂs using the restroom and IÂm holding the drinks, I decide to sit against the wall, which felt pretty cozy. As IÂm waiting there a boy comes up to me and asks, ÂWant a lightshow?Â I, still rollin' hard, get all excited like a 5 year-old on Christmas, my eyes light up, and I say Âyeah!Â like a little kid. The lights looked like nothing you can ever imagine unless youÂve experienced a lightshow on ecstasy yourself. You literally become in a trance. IÂm just sitting there looking all googly-eyed, looking like a complete retard to the hundreds of people walking by, but I didnÂt care. Eventually he said ÂAlright man, IÂm getting tired.Â I immediately say ÂThank youÂ like I mean it and smile, shake his hand, and he walks away not knowing (actually, IÂm sure he does) what a crazy state he just put me in for that minute or two.
25	3	a	My sister finally makes it back and we finally walk up the steps into the arena where the main dj was spinning the whole night. My sister, who wasnÂt on anything at this point, let out a Âfuck yeah!Â once we got to the top of the steps. The lights and lasers and music was almost overwhelming Â it was all so beautiful. Tons of people are up and dancing in the stands, some just sitting, looking dazed, probably coming down. People are getting light shows. People are giving light shows. People are massaging each other. People are hugging, smiling, just having the best time of their lives. I felt so at home with these thousands of strangers. The vibe was such a positive one and thatÂs what I loved so much and wish I could feel in everyday life. My sister and I find a good seat where we can see everything, and I give her the pink gun pill and she pops it. Out of the blue these two girls sitting behind us put one of those electric hand massagers on my head and shoulders, and at this point, the colored lights lights, the music, the positive vibes and people...this is ecstasy. This is where the name came from. This is the experience people are looking for. YouÂre happy, everyone around you is happy. Not a worry in the world. What could possibly be better?
26	3	a	After the amazing massage I ask the girl what her name was and she said ÂBear.Â I said ÂWhat?Â just to make sure I heard it right. ÂBear. Like the animal.Â  ÂOh cool!Â  ÂWhat about yourÂs?!Â ÂMy nameÂs Apollo.Â ÂNice to meet you!Â ÂIsnÂt this awesome!!!Â  Then we turn around and dance some more, get more amazing massages from them. Then I ask them if they want to trade kandi. You trade kandi my holding each others hand, and then sliding your bracelet onto their arm while youÂre holding hands.  She replied with excitement, ÂYeah! Let me find a good one!Â  She digs through the endless number of bracelets on her arms and says ÂHereÂs one with a star, because youÂre a star!Â *smiles*  And then I say ÂThis is my sisterÂs first rave!Â and she looks for another piece of kandi and says to my sister ÂHereÂs one with a bear claw, that way youÂll always remember me.Â Smiles everywhere. I get a text from my friendÂs cousin who took me to my first rave...he wants to hang out. So I turn around, say ÂIt was so great meeting you guys! Have a great night!Â Gave them a hug. And went on our way. It felt as if we all had just instantly bonded on such a deep, profound level. As IÂm writing this it still blows my mind how connected this drug made me feel to these complete strangers.
27	3	a	Now I go to find Ryan and all of his friends, whom IÂve hung out with at the other two raves IÂve been to. TheyÂre a bunch of awesome people. So my sister and I walked up the stairs in the very back of the arena, which had the best view of the lights. I see Brian standing up and waving to me, and I smile and walk past a couple sitting down and give him a hug. Then I say hi to the rest of the group, everyone welcoming and nice as usual. My sister and I sit down, enjoying this new, better view of the lights, the music still sounding heavenly.
28	3	a	Occasionally during the buildup in songs (almost to the climax), thousands of strobe lights would go off, and my eyes would go out of focus and roll to the back of my head. It was such an intense, awesome feeling. During one song I held on to my sister and yelled, ÂHoly shit! I canÂt handle this!Â Then I was given countless numbers of light shows, all of which were absolutely amazing. RyanÂs friend Timmy gave me a lightshow with an orbit and I was in a total trance, in a total world. My eyes just focus completely on the lights (then blur out), the feel of the bass rushing through my veins, and the high pitch of the synthesizers flowing so smoothly. It was indescribable. Ryan was sitting next to me looking at me get the light show, though I was so in a trance I didnÂt know he was there and until Timmy said Âholy shit, this guyÂs already fucked up!Â and then Ryan yelled ÂthatÂs called over-stimulation!!!Â Nevertheless, it was all amazing. Timmy or Ryan, I honestly donÂt remember which gave me an incredible neck and head massage where he would rotate my whole head and then do lots of meticulous things with his fingers that I could feel in detail. It felt like I was visiting a chiropractor. Every touch felt so precise, not to mention, so damn good.
29	3	a	Unfortunately I didnÂt enjoy the massage as much as I possibly could have because at the time I was trying to coordinate meeting up with a friend I had made online named...Gloworm. Yes, thatÂs all I knew her by. It took a while but finally in the concession stand area I see her turquoise sweatshirt and we immediately hug each other and smile and say how nice it was to finally meet, and continue hugging. She introduces me to her friends, one of which was sucking on an ornately decorated pacifier, the other guy chatting non-stop. TheyÂre names were Brunho and Hack, respectively. Hack, a black gay guy probably around 20 years old, shook my head and ask me to squeeze his nipples really hard. He lifts his shirt, and as requested, I squeeze his nipples. ÂHarder,Â he says, and I follow, just laughing and frying away. Gloworm keeps looking at me, saying ÂYouÂre so cute,Â and continues hugging me. Then her friends were ready to be on their way and they start to leave, and she just keeps hugging and says ÂWaitÂ to her friends. We continue hugging, which felt so comforting, we look at each other and kiss on the lips for a few seconds, which also felt great. We then trade our kandi that we made specifically for each other. I show her the one I made her before I slide it onto her arm and she looks at me in the eyes and goes Âawww.Â  Then eventually her friends convince her to leave she apologizes for having to go so soon. We kiss again and then we each go on our own separate ways, happy as can be for finally having had the opportunity to meet.
30	3	a	The rest of the night I hung out with my sister and RyanÂs group again, doing the same as weÂd been doing all night. I remember looking at my phone and realizing everything was about to end in 15 minutes and told my sister, ÂI donÂt want this to end!Â and she replied ÂThey should just keep it goin.Â Finally it was over. No more flashy lights. No more intense music. The arena we were in was once again just that. We left and I was still happy and feeling the drug, but it was definitely slowly dissipating. It didnÂt help that almost everyone else was pretty much down at this point. We walked back to the hotel at 4am. We head up to RyanÂs room where my sister and I use the restroom and then head to our car. At this point IÂm coming down and feel extremely physical tired, but my brain...the best way to describe it is, it felt like there was a storm in my brain. Just like 1314230423 things going on at once. At this point I realize IÂve been on a drug for the past few hours! We then attempted to drive to my brotherÂs apartment in Orange County. My sister, who was no longer under the influence was driving. She kept smoking cigarettes in the car, and that made me feel nauseous, even though IÂd been smoking a lot throughout the night. Then she turned up some trance on her radio real loud and I just had to turn it down cuz it made my head throb with pain. I got this super horrible headache right smack in the center of my forehead. I had this weird feeling like taking 3 that night might have been too much, but then I told myself that I just needed to go to bed. It was all in my mind. We finally arrive to my brotherÂs place and I immediately hop in bed and try to sleep, even though my head was still ringing. Coming down on e is when you realize, ÂDamn, this is a DRUG.Â It ainÂt pot or alcohol. My brain felt used.
31	3	a	The next day I was extremely tired and just wanted to lie in bed all day. Occasionally I would get another headache in the center of my head. Unlike the previous times IÂve taken ecstasy, the worst days were 3 to 4 days later. I just felt super depressed, and it wasnÂt one of those feelings you could just snap out of. I also had a short fuse and would get angry at things pretty quickly. ItÂs been a week now and IÂm finally feeling normal and happy again. But the comedown and after of this experience were by far the worst IÂve had.
32	3	a	Was it worth it? Yes. Each time IÂve taken ecstasy at a rave setting itÂs really been an amazing experience thatÂs taught me a lot. When IÂm on it and at a rave I feel so connected to people and I just love how everyone is nice to each other and thereÂs no judging Â you just feel like you can be yourself without any restrictions. And youÂre just so optimistic about everything. Everything about it Â the music, the lights, the people, the shift in perspective Â are all worth the Âholes in the brain,Â in my opinion. ItÂs an experience that youÂll never understand unless youÂve done it, and I know that lots of people are gonna judge me because itÂs a drug, but I donÂt care. ItÂs not like IÂm doing it every weekend, and in my opinion the experiences are worth it. If only everyone could be as nice to people as they are on ecstasy as they are in real life. I guess thatÂs the depressing thing once the drug is over. You realize youÂve been living in an ideal world for the past few hours, and now youÂre back to this.

35	3	a	E is definitely a drug that brings out the true emotions a person has inside of them. It has made me really bond with some people. But other times I have regretted using it.
36	3	a	One of the first times doing E was with a person I was already interested in. The rave that night was incredible and I spent the entire time with that one person, just bonding with her. And I really felt a true sense of pure happiness. But things didn't work out as planned as I was leaving for a long getaway. That night had been one of the most enjoyeable of my life, and the feeling had been mutual. I ended up leaving, planning to stay away from home for a year. The whole time away from this person I had ended missing them so much I decided to come back after only three months.
37	3	a	We both were not sure of how we wanted things to be when I came back. But we agreed to see each other still. I really looked forward to the next time I would be able to drop E with her again, but the anticipation turned out to be the only thing I enjoyed that night.
38	3	a	When we kissed on E our very first time the feelings were so intense, but the night of this rave our kiss was not even close to that. I wasn't even turned on by her anymore. I couldn't believe that such intense feelings could disappear just like that!
39	3	a	But if I couldn't even enjoy it on E then I realized that this was not going to work with her, and I know she felt the same way about things. I thank the E for really waking me up, instead of faking my emotions and lying everytime I tell her I care about her.

42	3	a	The only reason I take E is for spiritual expansion of my own consciousness. It has allowed me to be my true self more completely. I am less inhibited, yet it doesn't make me do anything I would not want to do, it just helps me get in touch with the inner wellspring of courage that I so often do not realize is there.
43	3	a	Ecstasy has also ignited major spiritual growth in my life. I have experienced kundalini energy rise up my spine while dancing at raves, although the biggest lesson I learned from E is that I should take more risks, because 9 times out of 10, I will be successful. Magical things happen for months after a successful trip.

46	3	a	[Most of the text below is also a part of the longer version of this account]
47	3	a	The best that I ever felt on ecstasy was something that was not quite happiness nor euphoria, but rather a profound and perfect sense of unity of mind, body, spirit and soul; and I understood in an instant exactly what happiness and being happy involved; and at the same time I was overwhelmed by a hope that I would someday get there.
48	3	a	I realised that I was looking for something that few people understand or achieve; something that I understand but haven't achieved and cannot articulate. I am searching for a state of being in which mind, body, spirit and soul are fundamentally indivisible yet each feeds the understanding of the other - a feeling that all the words in the world can only understate.
49	3	a	That night I almost found it. Someday I think I might. It is not something I will find alone, but rather by a dynamic combination of factors which have to be in the right place at the right time. I don't see ecstasy as escapism but rather it helps me on my journey, shows me the direction, or perhaps it helps me to see that direction, and
50	3	a	I personally don't believe I would have ever reached that point without the use of a psychoactive drug; which is why the 'I don't need drugs to have a good time' attitude is rather puzzling to me. I suppose the question is does it matter anyway, some people get on perfectly without either the use of drugs or reaching that state; my answer would be yes, it does matter a lot, or I wouldn't look for it, and having been made aware for the existence of such a state I don't think I will ever stop looking.
51	3	a	I've been trying to understand for a long time the antipathy towards the usage of chemicals for purposes other than the purely medicinal. And failed, really.

54	3	a	This is a query regarding the effects of ecstacy on a person with epilepsy. I have done some searching in books and on the web, but am yet to find much information on the subject. (I did notice it was mentioned in your book)
55	3	a	The reason I am writing to you is that everything I have read says that ecstacy and epilepsy do not mix and it is not something that I should try. Being young and inquisitive I decided to find out for myself, and in a very safe environment I have tried a couple of Es. From my experience the short term outcome was that I had no seizures on any of these occasions and for several days afterwards. This is from someone who rarely goes a day without a seizure. (I have temporal lobal epilepsy, involving complex partial seizures)
56	3	a	I acknowledge that I am taking a risk in relation to long term affects, but with such a new drug I think we all are. (It is no more of a risk than the prescription drugs I have to take that are no more than 5 years old.)
57	3	a	I do not expect you to have an answer to this question, but would be interested if you had heard of other specific incidences of epilepsy and ecstacy or know of where I may be able to find specific research. I also thought you may be interested in this experience for your own research etc.
58	3	a	As an aside I have approval from my neurologist to smoke marijuana to aid with my seizures. It is something that I noticed improved things for me, and I followed this up with similar searches in books and on the net to find that this was not an uncommon experience.

60	3	a	This account is my observation of my sister on MDMA.  I was unable to take the MDMA because I am on SSRI's, so I got a pretty sober description.
61	3	a	Effects did not kick in until about 2.5 hours, we now regret our timing with when she took the pill. 
62	3	a	While on MDMA, subject was speaking in drawn out questions and also cared about MY experience:'Is everything OKaaaaaay? Where are you goinnnnnggg?' --and this was in response to me getting up to use the bathroom. Maybe this suggests some anxiety on her part, but I couldn't help but think I had some fault in this because I didn't know how to react to someone rolling and if I should laugh or actually help her understand.  Now I wish I did the latter. 
63	3	a	I tried to offer support like giving her a massage, thinking positive thoughts, helping her in decision making, because that seemed to be very difficult for her, but she was easily convinced once I suggested something more authoritatively.  (Come on, just try to eat this.) 
64	3	a	Did not sleep very well, maybe 4-5 hours of interrupted sleep.  Now is trying to sleep again with a pounding headache, feelings of needing to throw up.  Adersion to loud sounds, photophobia, and is being negative 'I had to study today, I feel horrible'.
65	3	a	Gave her ibuprofen, vitamin C, and Geritol (Multivitamin), and black salt pill called Hajmola (she likes taking those they are for digestion and it is the only thing she feels like eating)

68	3	a	I had used MDMA 10-20 times before, and had realized that the effects of the drug were beginning to be milder each time.  After this i stopped taking the drug for the rest of my time in high school.  I also read an entry online that stated that MDMA use is no different if your second time doing it was a week or 10 years after your first use.  After reading this I took a break from taking it until a couple of friends were going to Atlanta Ga for New Years Eve.  I was looking forward to taking 'molly' or MDMA powder at the concert for NYE.  It had been more than six months since my last adventure with MDMA, and I was looking forward to seeing if the effects would be the same if not better than my first time use.
69	3	a	I took .2 grams of 'molly' that day and not as much as 5 minutes later was feeling the euphoric feeleings.  After this I did not look back.  I had no thoughts of the journal entry I had read online months before, but instead just thought about what a good time I was having at this concert.  My 'come down,' as many would call it, was not harsh by any means. I also realized that I had peaked for the entire concert.
70	3	a	This to me was ensuring evidence that my mind is the main factor of my 'trip.'  My conclusion to this story is that MDMA has no 'loosing the magic' to it, but instead I myself lose the magic.  This is my opinion.

73	3	a	Having a number of experiences with MDMA, I can say that I'm comfortable and informed about everything I experience, and certainly research beforehand for safety purposes.  A friend of mine told me he had some Pink Playboy pills.  Again, IÂve tried many different forms of MDMA (including Mollys), but I had yet to experience these.  From what he told me they were great.  I got to his house and despite the fact that I trust him fully and that he was himself at the time ÂrollingÂ, I proceeded to do some quick internet research to ensure I didnÂt take too many and have health issues.   [Erowid Note: 
74	3	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  Any music I had on my iPod was like heaven to me.  I found myself singing to just about everything without a care in the world.  
75	3	a	I met my lady friends at the Jacuzzi and we hung out for about an hour and a half.  They had no idea I was ÂrollingÂ because I figured they might Âtrip outÂ about that.  Forewarning about hot water immersion on MDMA, as your body temperature is already higher than normal (or sometimes colder, for that matter), itÂs extremely important to not stay fully immersed for too long.  Keep hydrated, etc. etc.  Anyways, the Jacuzzi was absolutely amazing.  I loved the feeling of the skin of the water on my palms.  Not to mention, dunking my head shortly was like a different world of feelings.  Underwater, I felt like I was floating (more-so than usual) and every part of my body tingled with pleasure.  I wanted to kiss one of the girls (or both haha) more than anything, but they are too good of friends.  I also wanted to be upfront with them of my mindset, but again, I didnÂt know how theyÂd react.  Plus, I want to share everything with everyone when I'm ÂrollingÂ so I had to tell myself to forget about sharing and talk with them.  This proved to be the right decision, and I found myself perfectly content with carrying on a conversation with them.  Around 11:30PM, I began to get the normal eye-flutters commonly experiences with MDMA.  The girls finally left and I returned to my house (the pool was in my community, so no more risky driving).  
76	3	a	When I got into my house I was ÂrollingÂ hard.  But not in a bad way, it was great.  I began to get visual effects similar to those while under the influence of mushrooms or LSD.  This was amazing for me because these visuals were unlike any IÂve ever seen before with MDMA.  I grabbed a glass of orange juice (to put some vitamin C in my body and to heighten my experience) and decided to feel anything I could find that was soft.  Everything sent tingles up my body and I loved it.  Lucky for me, my SUPER soft cat decided to join me.  IÂm allergic to cats, but only if I rub my face after petting them.  I proceeded to pet my cat (avoiding any contact with my face).  My cat felt unreal.  It was the most amazing thing IÂve ever felt on MDMA next to Kashmir fabric and my authentic rabbit fur Russian hat (which I actually purchased in Russia).  By this time I needed to urinate and headed to the bathroom.  The walls felt amazing, the bumps on the drywalls were definitely taking odd shapes, and they were warping slightly.  I probably spent a good half hour in the bathroom (which is simply a shower and a toilet, very small) looking at what I thought was a whole new world.  I was having such an amazing time I decided to come here and share my experience.  Currently, it is 3:50AM.  I am definitely still feeling plenty of effects, visuals and all.  
77	3	a	For ingesting all my pills by 9PM, IÂm comfortable saying this is the longest ÂrollÂ IÂve ever experienced.  To anyone interested in experimenting with MDMA for the first time, be smart.  Know who youÂre getting it from, very well.  Research the exact pills (color, size, shape, and logo) to get an idea of how much to safely ingest.  Read otherÂs experiences with the same pills, if possible.  DonÂt be too active, and if you do, make sure to take a break periodically as your heart rate is generally increased to begin with.  Drink plenty of water over time (but donÂt over hydrate).  For better effects, drink some orange juice, but not too much as this can cause vomiting.  Experience it with your friends, never alone.  Essentially, be smart, be safe, and have fun.  Trying to outdo yourself, ÂproveÂ yourself to friends, or just plain being an idiot can and more than likely WILL reap serious consequences.  In the end (or technically not the end since IÂm still feeling effects), IÂve had a great time.  I hope this is helpful to anybody who reads this.  DonÂt get the wrong impression about this article either.  This is not to entertain; it is for informational purposes and is intended to help/answer questions some may have.

79	3	a	Sometimes I just don't get it...  How can the government make such beautiful things illegal, it makes me want to scream.
80	3	a	Anywho, it was time for my friend J's last rave with us in the Arizona crew as he made his way to Cali.  We took a quick drive to [an event].  I had planned to take X again, so that was the first thing I was looking for.  Security confiscated my shopping bag of water, but let me keep my smokes. I got into the door and met up with M, K, Dee, Beezle, Bi, Hows, J, and Hed.  Hows got the X for us, it was two for $12, 'double stack' Blue Crosses.  I took two and so did nearly everyone else with the exception of M, K, and Beezle.
81	3	a	I finally hit, I could feel the tingle creeping up my spine, and began to instinctively bob my head to the music.  Five Minutes later I was swamped with it.  It was beautiful, I was covered in vibrating particles of bliss, and felt as if I wasn't even sitting on the floor.  Shortly thereafter I felt the need to burp, and it wouldn't come out.  The longer I couldn't burp the more I felt like my throat was getting closed up.  I gagged...  I realized I was going to puke.  It wasn't in my stomach, (the feeling that is), I just knew it was going to happen.  I stood up walked to the trash, and vomited.  The whole experience wasn't like puking with mushrooms or alcohol, it felt GREAT.  For a few minutes I thought I just puked my buzz away, but it came back.
82	3	a	People who don't go to raves don't understand them, you can tell them, but they won't believe it.  People really are that nice, I was offered water every two minutes, given back massages by completely random people, got lightshows all the time, and returned the favor also.  I enjoy being nice to people.
83	3	a	Things just felt great, even sober I have to say that I would be having a good time there with everyone.  My mouth started to hurt from the gum that I was chewing on.  I followed Bi around for a bit and finally got to know him, it was the first time I met him.  We ended up starting a little love fest in our corner of the room, and I laid for most of the next two hours kissing random women and girls, and writhing together on the floor.  Even though I was highly aroused, I just didn't get an erection.  I had only wanted one for a short while, but my attention span was pretty small, and I ended up using my mouth.  It was a bad choice that I would have made while sober, but I wasn't sober so it was even more fun for me.  There is something weird about the sensation of being so close to somebody, the smell, the heat on your face, the taste, the skin.  It just seems perfect.  She was a random person, and she was on X too.  When she was thoroughly satisfied, we both ended up giggling and laughing and saying thank you at the same time.  I invented a few new tricks to play on people who are rolling or shrooming that are based on my hypnotism techniques, but inspired and invented while I was rolling.  These only really work if one has the voice and the technique to work it.  I learned about hypnotic voices in books and on the internet.
84	3	a	Sit next to the recipient on the floor (indian style) with your body facing their right side. Gently rest your face on her temple and bring your mouth close to her ear.
85	3	a	Take their hand, and put your fingers between theirs, grasp loosely and lightly.
86	3	a	Me:' Now close your eyes and imagine.  You can see the outline of the room now, and the outlines of people become clear.  In the room there is a hazy light yellow mist, that vibrates with a pure beautiful energy.  It is flowing from the people and through the room full of vibrant perfection.  And as we sit together my body begins to pull in the energy like a vacuum.  The more energy my body pulls in the hotter my hand feels.  I pull in more and more of the vibrant energy, and my body begins to glow a bright yellow.  My hand gets extremely hot'
87	3	a	Me: 'And as I grip your hand and get hotter and hotter my hand begins to melt into a thick hot liquid.  My hand coats your skin and it feels as if it is slowly flowing through your skin into your arm.  The hot energy comes with my body and fills up your arm, every vein is hot and filled with a vibrant and beautiful energy.
88	3	a	Slowly blow hot breath from her hand up her arm, one or two times, SLOW AND HOT.
89	3	a	Your body is now filled with a beautiful and vibrant energy, and your arms and skin vibrate with and intense energy.  It is so beautiful and perfect.'
90	3	a	Blow on her face and neck with your nose, and then kiss her hand and let go.
91	3	a	It is taking me a little bit to finish this one, but I find that to be good.  Only because yesterday I felt pretty bummed, perhaps it was the X or maybe just J leaving.  Either way I felt sad.
92	3	a	I love X, I have to admit it, I won't stop.  But in reality, X alone loses some of the special value that it has at a rave.  The whole atmosphere, the kindness, the music, the dancing and the fun.  That is what I want, I wish I could have that feeling forever.
93	3	a	Now, only memories are left of the great time that I had.

95	3	a	MDMA (3) : Loss of Magic (34), General (1), Rave / Dance Event (18)
96	3	a	The length, intensity, control and power of my first MDMA trip is without comparison.  I had previously tried marijuana and smokeable DMT and subsequently I have tried psilocybin and Ayhuaska.  My Shaman informs me that he knows only one other person who has had an experience like mine and I would like to hear from other people who have.  I can only describe some of my trip here so I will talk to you about my ring and mirror, my psychic abilities, my increased physical strength and some ÂproofsÂ in religion.  I will keep my relationship with the Hindu Goddess Kali private! Remember that this entire trip lasted for an astonishing seven hours, not bad for a lifetimes worth of experience, but it was exhausting.  
97	3	a	It might be important to note that we had been smoking almost pure purple haze joints with added Shivas resin for an hour before the hallucinations started coming on.  I was strangely depressed just before the effects began, this is why I took an extra dab of powder and the effects took hold soon after. When I started going under I was immediately aware of its power, the start was like the beginning of DMT except that I was compelled to quest for something.  The quest lasted a short amount of time but was very difficult.  When I reached the top of a pillar of rock I found a tiny box on a pedestal, after sighing for it like some bizarre library, I unlocked the box and took out a ring consisting of two concentric gold pieces when I put this on the third finger of my right hand it split and locked on.  The two parts crossed at the sides of the lower knuckle and opened in a way that allowed me to flex my finger.  The flesh in-between the rings was now transparent to me in both the real world and the dream world.  I could use it to read auras and peoples thoughts in the real world. 
98	3	a	In the dream realm I now had absolute control; I could teleport to any place or time by seeing it in the ring and climbing through.  A short time later I stumbled across a very kind hearted shaman (he could make my spirit guide laugh) called ÂShenanÂ who showed me that my other hand was a mirror that I could use like a telescope to see things smaller or bigger depending on whether I looked through the palm or the back of it respectively.  This is how could see the entire universe (and beyond) past the DNA molecules, down to thought vibrations rippling across atoms.  In the real world I could use it to travel inside peoplesÂ memories.
99	3	a	At one point a new friend asked me to read his thoughts and not only could I describe the surroundings of his first house in detail but I reminded him that the patio was where he had first learnt to play chess, he was using black and facing the garden, the checking piece was a white bishop (I didnÂt even know he played chess before MDMA).   This sounds impressive but my skills were limited only to the past, when trying to see into the future I predicted to my embarrassment that the large Iraqi anti-war march was going to be bombed by pro-war terrorists.  My flat mate didnÂt go because of me.  For days after the experience I could clearly see other peopleÂs auras - it was particularly easy to read a womenÂs Â I had difficulty interpreting the colours meaning and even if I thought I was sure of my judgement I couldnÂt confirm the results easily. 
100	3	a	When I was certain that I had all the drugs out of my system I returned to jujitsu as usual.  Before I started the warm up I noticed that I could get my wrists to touch my toes when before MDMA I was straining to get my fingers there.  In the warm up I was the only one to be caught out for every press-up penalty in this game that the dojo plays.  At the end the Sempi in charge of the warm up sat on my shoulders to try to wear me out Â my strength and fitness had grown considerably.  After the session I realised that I had not eaten all day because of the twelve hours I had spent in the library. 
101	3	a	Although I did not want to ÂtestÂ or taint my visions I researched Egyptian and Hindu mythology, obscure eastern European religions and Shamanism.  The connections to some of the things in my vision and also to each other led me to believe that there is an accessible dream world that is very similar between different cultures and individuals.  I did wonder if I had imagined the visions as a strange mixture of ideology from religious education at school, but I hadnÂt studied any of this in such detail before.  If anyone is interested, Hera from Greece, Hathor from Egypt, Kali from Hindi, and the Neolithic Snake Goddess from Eastern Europe, and my vision loosely share the characteristics of: shape changing, horned snakes, the duality of being a lover and a mother, dog/jackal aspect, wealth, wisdom and war. 
102	3	a	The Âspill overÂ of powers from the dream world into the real world is the most intriguing experience of my life and as a philosophy student it has positively realigned my perceptions. I am now doing a dissertation based on some of the ideas I took from my trip.   As a final note I would like to express my hope that anyone who reads this has similar experiences on their favourite hallucinogens and to say Ânever underestimate the power of the human brainÂ.

104	3	a	MDMA (3) : Nature / Outdoors (23), Entities / Beings (37), General (1), Alone (16)
105	3	a	I have one pill that was given to me as Ecstasy/MDMA. I had split the pill in half, and swallowed one half with some tap water.
106	3	a	An hour passed and I felt nothing, so I swallowed the other half with some tap water.
107	3	a	A Half hour passes and I still feel nothing. So I undress and lay down in bed and try to go to sleep assuming the pill was bunk.
108	3	a	As I lay in bed I can feel tingling sensation crawling down my back from my shoulders, then a while later I moved my head and it felt incredibly light as if the force of gravity had been reduced. I then noticed the same sensation in my arm and decidied to get out of bed as I may now be feeling the sensation of the drug.
109	3	a	I sat in front of the computer and put on some music with headphones as it was late at night. I didn't notice any auditory distortions, but I felt differently about the music, possibly more emotionally connected.
110	3	a	My limbs feel so easy to move like they had been oiled. I wanted to dance to music but I was so physically relaxed that I found it difficult to hold my body upright.
111	3	a	As the experience intensified I became more physically relaxed to the extent that while sitting in the computer chair I coudln't hold my head upright either, all my limbs were floppy. I ended up laying on the floor with a pillow as I couldn't support my body.
112	3	a	Over all I notice a time dilation through the experience. 
113	3	a	At about 3 hours into the experience I went back to bed and went to sleep quicker than I usually do when sober.
114	3	a	I woke up about 7 hours later after a some of the best sleep I've had in a long time. For the next 2 days I feel totally relaxed as I did during the experience but all other effects of the drug are absent. This relaxation makes it difficult to to concentrate and focus on work.

116	3	a	MDMA (3) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Alone (16)
117	3	a	The purpose of this experiment was to determine if there is cross-tolerance between methylone and MDMA.  The usual dose of 220mg methylone was ingested five days prior to the MDMA experience.  The methylone experience was quite pleasant, with a few new insights and much relaxation.  The MDMA tablets were left over from several years ago from an airtight container, and from previous use, I knew they were good.  I had not consumed any MDMA-related substances (except methylone) for well over a year.
118	3	a	I took 1200mg of Piracetam two hours prior to dosing, but other than that, I had no other drugs in my system.
119	3	a	T+0: I ingested one MDMA pill on an empty stomach.
120	3	a	T+30mins: I experienced very difficult come-up effects, such as being unable to think clearly, slight over-stimulation, racing heart, chills, and fatigue.
121	3	a	T+2hrs: I never really felt like I Âcame upÂ.  However, at least the terrible come-up effects had dissipated by this time.  Euphoria was almost completely absent, and I was surprised how difficult it was to think or keep perspective during the come up phase.
122	3	a	T+4hrs: The last two hours werenÂt bad, but euphoria or feelings of ÂloveÂ never developed.  I got some good pondering done, but I felt little physical energy other than my strongly-beating heart.  My eyes were closed almost the entire time.  My pupils were very, very dilated, but I did not experience the ÂsoftnessÂ or ÂsparkleÂ around lights that is usually apparent with MDMA.  This is very unlike what these tablets did over a year ago.  I also did not experience any memory problems, but then again, I don't smoke pot.
123	3	a	Conclusion: Methylone may downregulate the receptors used for the MDMA high, or it may deplete similar neurotransmitters as MDMA.  Five days is not enough recovery time.  Overall, the MDMA experience was not worth it Â it was pretty much wasted.  However, the whole point of the experiment was to determine if there was cross-tolerance with methylone, and it appears there is, to quite a large extent!  I hope this information will be passed on to those interested.

125	3	a	My friend and I decided to buy ecstasy one night. We bought two yellow UFO pills. Since it was her first time, she only did half, and I did mine and her other half. At first, we thought they were kife(fakes) because they took so long to kick in. About an hour later, I started to rise, it was like my life was just vivid, and bright. My friend and I were giving each other hand massages, talking about life, philosophy. I felt like she was my best friend, my only friend. But someone else came into the room, someone who was not on E, and I felt the worst vibes from him. It almost scared me. I felt dread in my stomach, and I just asked him to leave. But the bad vibe clung to me. 
126	3	a	Around the 3 hour mark of being high, I started getting really hot and sweaty, and I went outside for a little bit. It had just started snowing, and the sun was rising. The snow was glistening, untouched, and it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. My trip lasted for about six hours, and then I started sketching out really bad. As my trip neared the end, I got a feeling of bitterness wash over me. I didn't want it to end. I had the worst crash, I didn't cry, but my friend did. She was holding her head, asking why she felt so bad, why did it have to end. We went to the coffee shop around the corner, but all I felt was bad vibes, and I just wanted to go home and sleep. I couldn't sleep all day, and I still felt horrible the next day. I was very depressed for a few days, but then I was fine again. I guess those are the up's and down's of doing ecstasy.

128	3	a	MDMA (3) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
129	3	a	Trip Dose and Duration: One pill, chemical analysis of a few of the same pills tested positive for MDA.  
130	3	a	I have used MDMA before three times, though it was three years ago, and I never really saw it for what it is, or even ÂunderstoodÂ it because of my love for traditional psychedelics.  It was quite a change, and I was expecting it to cause a trip, but with more of a feeling of comfort in the body and mind.  I never got any visuals, though I did feel awesome.  It never ÂchangedÂ me like Peyote, Psilocybe mushrooms, Morning Glory, LSD, and such has.
131	3	a	Well, I was on Pill Reports reading about a certain pill that plenty of people seemed to think were awesome on Thursday March 25th.  On Friday, I was in Wallmart and I ran into my friend ÂJÂ who said he rolled for the first time last night.  I wasnÂt too excited, but I asked him how he liked it.  He said he loved it, but I still wasnÂt interested because of my prior experience with entactogens.  I asked what was on the pill, and he described the exact pill I was reading about on Pill Reports that was around the area where I live.  My girlfriend was with me, and so we decided to give it a try.  I couldnÂt remember whether the pill was said to contain MDMA or MDA, but everyone said they felt very clean and very strong.  Many said they would never take more than two of the pills.  I proceeded to purchase two of them, and me, my girlfriend ÂAÂ, ÂJÂ, and another friend ÂPÂ went to his house where I was going to make them some Poppy seed tea, as they wanted to try it after I reported a few successful experiences to them.  PÂs cousin came down as well.  
132	3	a	Me and A swallowed the pills at exactly 11PM, right before we got back to PÂs.  I started making the tea for them, and I explained to them the process of making it in case I started rolling really hard and couldnÂt pay attention to what I was doing.  After about 20 minutes, I felt a little strangeness, but no euphoria yet.  I walked outside after making two cups of tea, and now PÂs cousin wanted to try the tea.  I walked outside off of the porch where A and PÂs cousin were sitting, and it was then that I noticed the euphoria coming on.  It was mild, but every wave was getting more intense.  I walked back inside, and P was finishing up his tea, and he commented on how dilated my pupils were, and he said I looked like I was rolling.  As soon as he mentioned the word Ârolling,Â that set it off.  A wave of euphoria shot up through me, and my heart started beating faster.  I felt a stimulation that led me outside.  I didnÂt want to be in a closed in space.  I asked A if she was feeling it yet, and she said she was unsure.  I told her to get up and walk with me into the yard, as I know sitting down can keep you from experiencing some of the effects.  
133	3	a	She started walking, and it hit her.  I started noticing something strange in that I was somewhat antisocial.  I mean, I enjoyed being around others, and I felt the connection, empathy, love, emotion, and everything, but I just wasnÂt wanting to express it in conversation.  I felt it all within me very strong though.  I sort of wanted to just ÂexperienceÂ it, and let it flow through me.  I sat with A in my car for a couple minutes, and we hugged and kissed, which felt awesome, but something didnÂt feel exactly like the Ecstasy I knew a few years ago. 
134	3	a	Once A got back to the seat where she was sitting, I walked out into the yard.  I started to notice that I was preoccupied, looking at the sky and lights, much like I was staring into visions induced by mushrooms.  I closed my eyes, and it seemed as though all of the emotion that was flowing within me was expressing itself in closed eye visuals.  It was as if I was ÂseeingÂ love and passion.  I opened my eyes, and just as well, there were visuals in the sky.  I was amazed, and I walked up to J.  I looked at him and said, Âthis isnÂt MDMA, itÂs MDA.Â  Every description of effects IÂve ever read about MDA was running through me.  I was rolling so hard that my eyes kept rolling in the back of my head in pure ÂEcstasy.Â  As I opened them, my eyes twitched with Nystagmus.  When they twitched, the lights softened as if they were bright fireflies in the midst of a misty summer night.  There was a comforting blurry vision as well as the visuals that softly entered my visual field.  I was, as many people that are into Ecstasy would say, Âblowing up.Â  I have never rolled that hard, and I was tripping on top of that.    
135	3	a	I tried to think of what could make the experience better, and the only thing I could think of was Cannabis.  I went downstairs and took three large hits of high grade Cannabis, and I walked back inside.  This intensified the visuals so much that I couldnÂt concentrate on anything.  I stared off of PÂs porch into hallucinogenic space for nearly half an hour.  I felt beyond awesome.  The twitching of my eyes continued and the visuals flickered about.  I was still rolling my eyes in the back of my head, and I was having a true, inner experience.  There was movement about the air and I had what I can only describe as Âclosed-eye movies.Â  Though there was generally less Âconnection,Â empathy, and social enhancement than with MDMA, the sheer euphoria was far more intense.  This was what I vaguely pictured MDMA to be like when I first tried it.  With my use of Methylone, I started to realize some of the things that drew me away from these types of entactogens.  There was something feminine that I found about them.  
136	3	a	I came up with alot of theory that I wonÂt get into here, but I found the reasons that I leaned more towards traditional psychedelics, though I did still like the entactogens.  Now I knew why.  MDA lacked most of that feminine aspect as well.  The inner feeling was indescribable.  It wasnÂt just physical, it was spiritual. 
137	3	a	I started thinking about alot of things that had been bothering me within the past few months.  I started realizing that I was growing a hatred towards different aspects of life itself, and that the hatred was directed at the wrong source.  All the while I should have been hating the true evil of the world, I was blaming our society, government, and culture for many things that were distressing me.  The MDA seemed to point me in the right direction, and help me understand that these underlying evils need to be pointed out, and lived against instead of lashing out against the government and society.  I started thinking about communism, and its bleeding into America.  People donÂt even realize it.  But with all the realizations, all I could really do is reaffirm my faith in God.  It is the only place I find peace of mind.  I believe the MDA pointed me to it.  
138	3	a	It was 4AM when I got back to AÂs house where I was staying, and I was still rolling a little, and I was definitely still tripping.  I had a swift crash, but I didnÂt get any negative thoughts or anything.  I just felt physically drained.  I believe I didnÂt experience a harsh come-down because of the life changing experience I had.  Though I felt very drained the following day, I was filled with new ideas and beliefs about things for a week after.  I have had plenty of life changing experiences on traditional psychedelics, but this was my first for entactogens.  I still favor natural psychedelics, and I always will, but IÂve now seen the power that entactogens can offer.  I will say this though, I definitely favor MDA over MDMA.  One of my friends told me of someone that tried MDA back in the day, and said they called it ÂCub Scouts of America,Â or Coke, Smack, and Acid because it gave you the strong euphoria and stimulation of Cocaine, but it gave you the intense euphoric body feelings of Heroin, and it made you trip.  Though this is a stretch, I can understand where he got that from.  MDA has a special place in my heart, and I now understand the unique psychedelic effect that entactogens offer.
139	3	a	I went back on Pill Reports and these pills were tested to be MDA.  I also talked to someone that is experienced in chemistry, and they said there was around 100mgs of MDA and no other testible material other than filler in the pills.  The pills were alot thicker than most Ecstasy pills IÂve ever seen.

141	3	a	MDMA (3), MDA (34) : Small Group (2-9) (17), What Was in That? (26), General (1)
142	3	a	I started taking exstacy with my husband because one of our friends tried it and recommended we try it.  The first time we took it, we were at home with the kids tucked tightly in bed.  We retreated to our family room, turned on some R & B, snuggled on the couch and within 40 minutes, we felt a rush of warmth all over our bodies. We sat up all night long just talking!  We literally didn't walk up the stairs until 7:30 the next morning. Scientifically, when you take X, it releases seratonin in your brain and when it is released for the first time, there is no better feeling in the world!  The first time we took it, we took 1 1/2 pills each.  That was more than enough for our first time.  The next few times we took it, which was within 6 weeks, we took 2 each.  
143	3	a	As we did it more and more (about every 6-8 weeks), we had to take more and more.  The effects weren't as wonderful as the first time though.  Therefore, some people may say it loses its affect the more you take it.  That is what happened to me.  I just couldn't take it anymore.  I had my fun with it and that was it.  I noticed though that after I stopped taking it I had become depressed.  I was even on anti-depressants for 6 months.  It doesn't effect everyone the same way.  My husband still gets that old time feeling every time he takes it.  Though he doesn't take it anymore because I don't.  If we were to do it again, he would feel as though it were the first time.  So, if you take it, know your limits and if you do get depressed, it is best to go see your doctor and be honest with them!  If they dont' know what you have taken, they can't help you.

145	3	a	MDMA (3) : Depression (15), Loss of Magic (34), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
146	3	a	I recently went to a doof on the north coast of NSW Aus, I had a great time.  I dropped 2 different pills 1.5 hours between, one of which i have had many times before.  I became pretty much paralytic, and had mild hallucinations.
147	3	a	2 weeks later i went to a rave, had 2 pills 1.5 hours between, nothing, except a little bit happier.  I had a break of 1 week, went to a concert, had 1 pill and some G, the G was awesome, but barely felt my pill. had another 1 week break.  Then last weekend, had a trip the night before the doof, then went to the doof, 2 pills, 1 point, same thing again, felt a little happier, but nowhere near the experiences that i have had before.
148	3	a	I'm thinking i need a little break but everything is way too tempting.  I'm going to HAVE to take a couple of months break so i can once again enjoy my drug of choice.
149	3	a	I don't know whether it could be the prescription drugs that i am on, warfarin, cipramil (which i don't take if i'm planning on dropping) and Flower essences (i'm a case study for a friend at college).

151	3	a	MDMA (3) : Rave / Dance Event (18), Loss of Magic (34), General (1)
152	3	a	So, i've dropped pills before but theyve all been the equivalent of maybe a half dose.. I never actually got the full on feeling..
153	3	a	Anyway, I aquired an igloo pill... I went home and tested it with my newly recieved marquis reagent and it turned black.. I decided that i was gonna take it at a large event coming up.. I also had a euro pill left ... I had aquired 3 euros a year ago and dropped on two occasions with effects, but less than satisfactory..(BTW they also tested black)..
154	3	a	So, the night of the event (jam band kinda thing,  but pretty massive) comes and I'm stoked... I take the igloo and the euro with, just in case the igloo isnt strong enough.. I'm determined to have a 'strong experience'.. Sadly, i go by myself, but given the nature of ecstasy, i figure ill make friends.. I always see people rolling at concerts.. I also pack up with some blue glowsticks with ropes, and a vix inhaler..
155	3	a	When I get to the event, I have to sit there in painful anticipation for a few hours..  I decide to drop after the first band, so that my peak will wear off right as the event ends(If all goes as planned).
156	3	a	When they are finished, I drop the igloo.. tastes bitter, good sign. I go and sit in the grass and wait.. I start noticing some perceptual changes.. Like the tendency to notice things more. Nothing strong.. When the band comes on i feel the come up.. Theres this warm sensation that encompasses my entire midsection.. Its that feeling you get when you desperatly want to be held.. My mood lifts and i go and dance with some pepple i dont know, but dont talk to them.. this pill isnt very strong.. in fact these are the same weak effects i got with the euros.. So after 30 min i pop the other pill and keep dancing.. Up tot this point im feeling good, but not rolling.. I would have this little peaks of excitment that went along with the peaks in the music.. I was at a ++.. Then the second pill hit..
157	3	a	When, it hit all i could so was 'Oh shit'.. To describe the feeling is like decribing the color green to a blind man.. So this is what everybody's talking about.. So this is ecstasy..
158	3	a	It hit in a mindblowing rush.. It feels as if every nerve in my body has been electrified.. This invisible 50 pounds that id been carrying all my life, was lifted off my shoulder.. I floated from place to place.. Colors were brighter, but more noticably richer.. 
159	3	a	Its amazing, when I'm on E, people seem to come up to me.. every single person that approached me, i felt was my friend.. The cheesy love that expected was not, but filled with a deeper sense of kindred,  more of this feeling of unity.. how we're all in this together.. Most of them were drunk.. I listened to this one guys drunken story about shrooms for 10 mins., and i was amazed at how well i listened and connected with him.
160	3	a	The body rushes were so insane at one point that i had to sit down and just watch.. i could definitly not drive in this state. Everything, looked crisp and defined.. my voice seemed to come from deep within me.. I had a bit difficulty talking, as in forming the words that i wanted to say.. After this flooring rush wore off, the speedy effects came on, and i danced my ass off, with the glowsticks.. I didnt care if I looked like an ass.. In threat to my ego became non existent..
161	3	a	I normally am socially introverted, and have difficulty initiating conversations with people.. X eliminates any embarassment, social hangups, and fear of rejection that you may have with strangers, escpecially girls for me (I was even rejected once, and i just shook it off as their loss).. Talking essentially came with ease and my mormally poor self image was boosted by 1000%.. When i looked in the mirror i notcied my attractive qualities, instead of dwellling on the negative.. My eyes were the coolest things in the world. Girls would come up and hug me, cuz they knew the E feeling, and it was the most postive reinforcement ever.. Warm energy flows thru you and you see people as genuine beings instead of just people..
162	3	a	Thruout the night, I hung out with probably 7 different groups of very accepting people.. I was given a light show, and figured what all that was about.. Just waving it in front of my eyes made them vibrate wildly and make me go weak in the knees and almost fall of.. Interesting phenomena.  When the concert ended on that final song, and the crowd was going nuts, i felt a part of human kind.. A part of some great benign energy flowing thru us all.. 
163	3	a	Amazingly, my peak wore of over 20 minutes after the concert.. I hung around and had some even better conversations.. I think the final hour of X is the best for therapy, because you are empathetic and you social barriers are still down, but you arent rushing so hard your mind is clouded.. you feel very lucid.. I had a nice conversation with a girl from alabama, and she talked with me until i was sober enough to drive.. The final comedown wasnt even as bad as an amphetamine comedown! I even got to sleep easier. The next day i still felt a connection to people and i felt happy and energized.. I think prozac on the comdown helped alot.. 
164	3	a	In conclusion, i think MDMA is a wonderful tool to show how we should interact with people .. It lets see a person for what they are and not just a pretty or ugly face. Ecstasy is the drug for me!

167	3	a	I am an infrequent user of X.  I've only used it once in the last 6 months and that was 3 months ago.  Last week, I had to take a pre-employment drug test as a condition of hiring.  They did a hair test off my legs (I have short hair), and I came up over three times the positive/negative cutoff (18.6/5).  The test was meant to find the NIDA-5 within the last 90 days, but the test results that my employer got specifically pinpointed the positive as MDMA.  I don't think I'd pass in another two weeks as high as the result was.

169	3	a	I took 1 tab of MDMA about 1:00am on December 24th.  The effect of the pill took about 40 minutes to kick in.  At first I had a sick feeling in my entire body, followed by a sudden rush of energy.  A feeling like I would expect from Crystal Meth.  Within 20 minutes of these first effects, I experienced an awareness of touch and sound.  Everything had a softer side to it.
170	3	a	The total experience lasted until 8:00am.  I then slept for 3 hours.  Upon waking, I felt very week, and very thirsty.  Kind of fuzzy in the head, like a long night of drinking.  I attended holiday functions that afternoon, and upon returning home I took another tab about 8:00pm.  I again felt the sickness in my stomach, and never reached the peak I had experienced earlier that day.  About 11:00pm I took another tab, this time without the sick feeling, but a very strong peak.  Again with strong effects of touch and sound.
171	3	a	I finally went to bed about 3:00am on December 25.  I woke up about 8:30am and again had a need for some water.  All day I have experienced a mild sick feeling in my entire body, and some joint pain.

174	3	a	It was about 10pm and me and my friend decided to roll in the hot tub. We took red dragon which is very strong and its pure mdma. This being my second time rolling, I wanted to start rolling in the hot tub.  My first time I took one and a fourth in Vegas and that was amazing so we thought the hot tub would be even more amazing.  
175	3	a	A half hour went by and the water felt amazing. About an hour later we took another roll.  When it was all said and done we took a total of 4.  So we were just enjoying the hot tub when my neighbor said her dog jumped over my wall and her dog couldnÂt get back over.  Rolling hard I walked over there and by this time I was freezing and clenching my jaw I had to go put some pants and a robe on. When I came back out the dog and my neighbor was gone.  I started tripping out and getting all paranoid.  This is when it started to get interesting. My house and back yard was pitch black.  So the shadows started playing with my head.  
176	3	a	At first I started seeing a hutch to my right. At first I started seeing a hutch to my right. It was very vivid and had a ton of detail it was dark and woven.  Then I looked up at the street lights and they changed colors from yellow to orange and had a glass lamp over them.  Then when I was looking past the street light I saw a round almost like a baby toy but it was bigger than my neighbors two story house and it had squares in it and some popped out with different signs on it. I closed my eyes to see if it was really there but it wasnÂt it disappeared.  Then I told my friend what I saw and he said he could see the hutch but not the ball. Then when I looked straight ahead where there was a dead tree with no leaves on it the tree turned into a palm tree with really bright colored branches that moved in the wind. They were baby blue, baby pink, yellow and the bottom of the tree was like a palm tree it was really really pretty.  Then I left my back door open and all the lights were out and there was this dog that was walking in and out of my house and a man appeared in the doorway he looked almost like a hunter but he never came out of the doorway.  He seemed like he was a hunter.  Then there was another dog that came out and went back in throughout my trip. I think that my neighbor really made me paranoid but this felt so real it was crazy. 
177	3	a	This next part gives me Goosebumps.  When I looked straight ahead there were these giant men there were like 15 of them walking in the street in between my house and my neighborÂs house across the street.  They kept walking over my wall and my neighborÂs wall.  Then all of a sudden there was a giant pallet and they were working on my neighborÂs house and got like halfway through the pallet when it finally started wearing off.  Apparently my friend and I were rolling balls for 6 hours in the hot tub.  If we werenÂt tripping so hard music would have definitely helped our trip.  Then I finally got out and made him go inside first to make sure there was no one in there. 
178	3	a	I hallucinated everything the only thing that was really there was that dead tree with no leaves. Apparently my friend who has done this many times before said that heÂs never heard of someone hallucinating that much just on mdma.

180	3	a	MDMA (3) : Entities / Beings (37), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
181	3	a	I had only recently started using ecstasy on a weekly basis.  Once a week seemed like a decent amount, not too much and with a good break in between each trip.  Then I got tempted into ÂdroppingÂ two days, back to back. I got tempted into ÂdroppingÂ two days, back to back.  I didnÂt think much of it: Âokay, IÂll just be a little more cracked out Sunday.Â  And I was just a little more tired, a little more brain-dead.  
182	3	a	However, Sunday night was a nightmare like IÂve never experienced before.  I was lying in bed with my boyfriend, almost asleep but already in a nightmare.  I was in an auditorium with flashing lights.  There were little girls surrounding me.  They were all looking at me smiling.  Their eyes were perfect black circles, dark and deep, sucking me into their world.  I couldnÂt take it anymore and pulled myself out with a gasp of fresh air.  I woke my boyfriend up and told him to turn the lights on for me, that I was having a nightmare.  He told me everything was okay and to go back to sleep.  The second I put my head back down on the pillow I was sucked back into the dark.  The girls with the extremely dilated eyes smiling at me, digging into their hearts.  Their faces started to swirl as they passed their black hearts over to me.  It was so horrifying but I couldn't stop staring at them.  They were terrifying and loving at the same time, almost like the drugs I have been using.  I woke up to my boyfriend shaking me, telling me to wake up.  
183	3	a	I told a friend about this experience and he pondered whether it might have been my mind and body telling me to stop using ecstasy so much, that I was imagining ÂKandi GirlsÂ: strangely happy girls with dilated eyes, pouring their love out to me but in a way that might hurt themselves.  It may have been my mind telling me that ecstasy could only make me happy to a certain extent.  After that it, the happiness would be false, a strange, dark happiness that, like the Kandi Girls, could lead to injury of my mind and body.

185	3	a	MDMA (3), Dreams (85) : Hangover / Days After (46), General (1), Unknown Context (20)
186	3	a	Welp, a few things. I've taken e before a few times, but never pure mdma powder. Also, I have been friends with my boyfriend for many years, many many years, best friends, and about eight months ago he kissed me one night and we've been together ever since. Except for periods of extensive fighting over the past two months, which have caused me to move out. Most recently I had to be physically removed from the 'premises' aka our home because I was being violent and causing a domestic disturbance. I digress (but  these things generally resolve themselves).
187	3	a	So after fighting all day on valentines day and I had been waitressing for seven hours at a restaurant, he decided that I could come over and we could hang out on the condition that if he asked me to leave, I had to leave. Around eleven I get to the house determined to cheer him up so first I act goofy, then I announce that I want to eat the molly and if he won't eat it with me I'll do it all by myself. He just had surgery on his nose so we ate it instead, first he licked his finger and dipped in the powder and fed it to me, then he ate some. We hung out for an hour, nothing really happened, so we ate more. 
188	3	a	About a half hour after that I started to feel kinda tingly and thought 'Shit, this is it!!!' and ran to the bathroom to check out my pupils. FREAKIN' HUGE SON. So I ran back and forth to the bathroom a couple times, my pupils were monstrosities, I was afraid the black was going to seep out of the 1mm of brown left and just pour into my eye (not because I was paranoid or freaking out, but because I was like, whoa, dem eyes is huge). 
189	3	a	So then we just hung out and I started to feel very chill, explaining that I really wanted our relationship to work, I had been driving him apart from me for the past few months, I needed to trust that he loved me and wouldn't cheat on me, then obviously I cried a little bit and he said that he hated to see me cry. We were mushy gushy for a few minutes, but in a serious manner. Then we listened to John Legend and laid on the bed.
190	3	a	At this point I started calm down, and was like, 'This can't already be the come down.' It was only 1:45am. So we ate more. I noticed that it definately came in waves, unlike the e pill I had eaten a few months earlier. I also noticed that this was much less intense then the e pill, meaning I wasn't talking nearly as fast, I wasn't as ridiculously psyched, I was just very warm and chilled out. I likened the molly to being a warm glass of milk. 
191	3	a	So about every hour we kept eating more doses. Then (wellllp I'm about to be frank here), I was laying on my belly and felt something in my butt. Yes, my boyfriend took the liberty of just putting molly in my bum. HA! Buuuut it worked. A few moments later I jolted up, revived, and really rolling. However my bum did burn a little bit. 
192	3	a	We chilled a little more, continually re-upping, and at 7:45 we contemplated another dose but I was like 'nah, its eight, we gotta save some more' (he had bought a gram of pure a few months ago, I would say we had half left, meaning we each took a quarter of a gram). 
193	3	a	The next day we literally laid in bed until four, sometimes waking up, sometimes napping, just cuddling with our black 100lb hound dog and 20 something pound cat. It was crowded but nice.
194	3	a	Then I noticed I was still feeling a little gooey, grinding my teeth, and exclaimed 'What if the molly you put in my bum is stuck in some crevice and its going to continually and slowly release itself and I'm fucked up for like three days?!' But that (unfortunately) was not the case.
195	3	a	Walking was really hard (probably from the molly AND from being sedentary for about 18 hours) and taking a shower was tough. I just sat under the water. Went and got breakfast and ordered bacon... Holy shit, my teeth were so sore from the grinding that the bacon was killlllllllling me. I ate about a half a pancake and was fulled up. 
196	3	a	In conclusion, molly and e were different. Molly was actually more mild, but next time I'm going to eat a whole shiteload off the bat and see what happens. Yes, some will probably go up my bum. With molly I grinded my teeth a lot (but not with e), so yeah. 
197	3	a	 Definately helped us relax and for me personally, I came to a lot of conclusions about needing to grow up and trust my boyfriend, he's 26 and I'm 21 so I really need to stop acting like a little hs biddie and believe he loves me. Furthermore, with e the next next (ie sunday) day was a bummer, I was sorta depressed and thought 'Oh my god, he will never love me as much as he did last night ever again!!' but with the molly I'm  just back to my normal self. 
198	3	a	I love this drug but I know if I do it more than once a month I'll destroy my brain. Unfortunately :o )

201	3	a	I've smoked weed for about a year now and do it pretty much everyday.  AT LEAST once everyday.  Then I decided to move onto other things and heres my story about E
202	3	a	--------------------------------------------------------------------
203	3	a	Thanksgiving day after I was all done eating me, my brother, his friend and his girlfriend were chillin watchin some TV when we decided to go out.  A couple days before I had asked my brothers girlfriend to pick me up a pill cuz I wanted a sure thing my first time and she had some trustworthy friends.  On our way to buy some weed I was debating whether or not to do it that nite...I decided to(obviously).  So I chewed it up so it would hit me quicker and godamn did it taste awful.  I washed it down with some applejuice and waited...
204	3	a	We rolled up to the usual dealin spot and no one was there...so we were leavin and we saw this pretty shady lookin man standin outside of 7-11 so we pulled in there and asked him for some bud...long story in the end we lost $40 and ended up with no bud then I was completely blown.  We went to pick up another friend and as I got out of the car it just began to hit me.  I was smilin dancin talkin all pasionetly and I cant even describe the feeling of hapiness I had inside me. I'm usually an incredibly happy guy cuz I just dont enjoy being sad but I have never been so boosted as I was then. This friend that we had just picked up happened to be a girl and happened to have expierience with X.  I was completely in love. Just everything about her seemed so cool! We went to ANOTHER friends house and picked up some marajauna, then my brother told the story of how we were hustled and the man hooked us up with even MORE bud.  We smoked some marajauna and I was smilin and bobbin my head to the music and/or talkin about everything that seemed important to me. We dropped the friend off we had just picked up and had a total of four people in the car.  We went to pick up another friend and I went into his house...
205	3	a	I looked in the mirror and my pupils were incredibly dilated.  Like my entire eye was black but I was cheesin so hard.  I wandered around my friends house and saw a picture of his lil sister who is a year older than I am and I fell completely in love(again).  We left(I didnt get a chance to meet his sister unfortunetly) and went to the bowling alley.  We got in and did our thing and started to bowl when I realized that there were sooooo many people in the bowling alley.  I told this to my brother and he pointed out there were only about 100.  I did some math in my head and figured that there are 50 million times that amount of people on this earth.  I wanted to talk to all of them!! I wanted to talk to all of them and change all of their lives. 
206	3	a	So were at the bowling alley so I was bowling and I was INCREDIBLY rollling and I was INCREDIBLY high and my first few bowls were awful...I actually tossed a ball in the air it sucked so bad but I was still happy cuz I was rollin like no other. After bowling we dropped one friend off and then my brother off at home so he could pick up his car and take me home the next morning(we were sleeping over at his girlfriends house).  When we got to my brothers girlfriends house I found out that my parents were so pissed off at me becuse they didnt know I was sleeping out that nite and they wanted me home rite away.  I was rolling so hard and it would have bummed me so bad to go home. I convinced my brother to let me call my parents and he said 'ok I dont know if it will help I argued with them for 30 minutes and they didnt budge an inch.' so I call my parents at 1 in the morning and...I ended the conversation in control with the outcome I wanted.  My brother was goin nuts cuz he thought we were in deep shit and I was gonna get caught.  We watched batman, drove a friend home at 3 AM and I went to bed
207	3	a	Jesus christ I learned so much from this expierience...THERES ALMOST NEVER A REASON TO BE SAD...this is my life philosophy.  The one downside however is that when I get bummed I'm completely blown...but that rarely happens.  Also xtc is not a 'fuck up' drug it doent fuck you up...it enhances everything...touch...sound... Sight...it helped me get out of that situation with my parents. I love MDMA, but its too expensive... Thats my expierience.

210	3	a	IÂve been smoking chronic since I was 16. IÂve been experimenting with stronger drugs since the first time I tried mushrooms. X to me is like a Âwonder drug.Â  The reason I say that is every time IÂm down or the stress that life brings can sometimes be overwhelming, and X has always guided me out of life's troubles. I first time I tried x, I took two pills and had a blast! The second time I tried x, was about two weeks ago.
211	3	a	IÂve been having so much stress from work and my girlfriend from 5 years recently broke up with me so I took two x pills to elevate my mood my girlfriend from 5 years recently broke up with me so I took two x pills to elevate my mood. The x I took this time was way more potent than the last beans I got last time. These purple rhinos came up quick; I immediately felt it within 30 minutes. Covering myself in a warm blanket with some techno in my living room, I started to question my life, religion, and my ex girlfriend. No more worries, no more stress just pure happiness.  About an hour later into the trip, my living room became a living rainbow. All the color were so vivid, and the longer in stayed wrapped in my blanket the harder I would trip.  
212	3	a	IÂve never felt so free, and I can honestly say. I forgot about my relationship and was stressing me and it never came back. Not to mention all the crazy hallucinations while peaking. My peak lasted about 1:30, the plateau 5:00 and I crashed for the rest of the next day.

215	3	a	The doses described in this report are potentially life threatening. The amount taken is beyond a heavy dose and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Doses such as this have been known to cause hospitalizations and/or deaths. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
216	3	a	Took 1.4 grams of mdma crystal and was off my face completely. My jaw was rattling up and down so violently that I knocked a tooth out of place. An my eyes were bouncing round 180 degrees. Which at times was very strange. I couldnt focus on anything at all. They were going side to side and up and down every 3 seconds it seemed. An on the come up spewed hard an was rushing so hard it felt amazing. 
217	3	a	But days afterwards my mouth is still bone dry with ulsers all over my tongue. And I have a strange sort of light headed headache constantly. An my memeory is that of a goldfish I'm forgeting everything like wat I have walked upstairs for an stuff like that. 
218	3	a	Overall it was an awesome buzz but I feel I shouldnt feel this bad still at 4 days ago I took it.

220	3	a	MDMA (3) : Hangover / Days After (46), General (1), Unknown Context (20)
221	3	a	This is just another one of the mind expanding experiences I've had thanks to drugs. The day before this trip I had taken a 1/4 Roll of a 'CP' pressed ecstasy (which am I assuming made my serotonin levels unbalanced for my trip). I bought 3.5gs of shroom caps from a hippie that sells me great acid and potent shrooms. I've had good and bad mushroom trips in the past with visuals, mind fucks, etc... This trip I had extremely faint visuals that I had to focus my complete attention on.
222	3	a	I ground the caps (mushrooms w/o the stems) up and filled them into seven .5g capsules and ate them around 8pm. During the trip I became bored of this low serotonin mediocre head space so I decide to roll all my weed into joints. I smoked an hour after dosing to alleviate any nausea, this brought nothing to my trip. I facetimed my girlfriend, although we conversed it was difficult for me to bring up topics while I rolled joints on my desk. Less difficult than say being loaded on 500mics of Cid. When I saw my face in the selfie camera I could see my face looking 'Shroomy' but not the 'crackhead' look of Acid.
223	3	a	I found this trip neither good or bad, but a waste of $40. Perhaps I had a weak strain of shrooms (which is not likely from my hippy) so I accredit this wasted trip to my MDMA use the night before. Moral of the story, I'll stick to the green sticky icky if I plan on taking a trip into my sub-conscious anytime soon.

226	3	a	Setting: ULTRA festival 2002 in downtown Miami with three of my friends (a techno/DJ music festival)
227	3	a	Mood: A little depressed, alienated from the people around me. I think to myself I guess this MDMA pill should set things alright, thats what there for!
228	3	a	I take the pill as the sun is setting. An hour later I had the worst experience of my life. Pacing around the concert hall trying to fight my body from having a seizure or a heart attack. Never have I felt this physically sick. It was absolute psychosis...So I ditch the place and end up walking around downtown Miami for 3 hours until this crap wears off.
229	3	a	I did not realize love or empathy like MDMA has done to me in the past. I realized the pain and suffering of the world we live in every day. Overall a very depressing and psychotic experiece. I will never do X again.

232	3	a	Halloween was coming up and me and some of my closer friends were tryin to figure out something fun to do for this festive occasion.
233	3	a	We first tried looking for some LSD as to have a magical and comical trip, but thoes plans soon feel through. Then another oppourtunity arouse, we had the chance to buy some pure ecstasy from one of my friends family members. This was my first expeirience with E by the way and I was told it was going to be a really good roll. So I was pretty psyched about it. 
234	3	a	The time came for us to pop the pills, we each ingested them at around 5:30 p.m. Just before having a lil smoke before hitting the streets. Well the weed was the shittiest weed I ever smoked in my life (well we got it for free so what was I supposed to expect)so it wore off by the time the pill kicked in.
235	3	a	Well the shwag we had was a pretty shitty start to the night, my back began to hurt and I was feeling tired and lazy. So we sat down to eat some candy, at this time its now 6:10, when all the sudden soemthing amazing came over me. I looked over at one of my friends and just began to laugh, but it wasnt like a stoned laugh where something stupid is funny, it was just because I got so extremely happy for no obvious reason. This was deffinatley more then I expected so I jumped up off the curb we were sitting on and exclamied how happy I was and all the euphoria and energy that was surging through my body. About 15 minutes later all 5 of us were rolling face. Well the first part of the roll was very exciting and I wanted to talk to as many peoiple I could find, going up to strangers asking them how they are doing, and how I love there house designs. I just felt so at one with every living thing. They were all my best friends. And you couldnt imagine how greatfull I was for the friends I was with and had. We walked all around shareing personal things or feeling we had. Stuff that we kept secret to the world, I can remember telling them how I loved them and I wanted to stay friends with them forever. The feeling I got from this drug was so unique and amazing, I was just so happy to be alive and experiencing this. Now its about 2 hours later and I'm still rolling very hard, its about this time when we run into some other friends of ours, they offer us some weed so we go smoke with them, BAD IDEA! The stoned asses and our rolling dumbasses decided to smoke in the middle of an open park. I didnt even realize how stupid this was because of how happy I was just to be there. Well a little bit after we light up the bowl a few times, as I'm exhaling a bright light shines at the side of my face. My heart jumps and I dont know what was runnign through my mind, but at that moment I just walked away from the crowd, there was a few of my friends off to the side a little and I waved them over.
236	3	a	Out of 9 of us , 3 of us had walked right away. A cop stopped us in the distance but let us go. We had ecscaped.
237	3	a	We were so nervous of what was about to happen to the rest of our friends, but about 15 minutes later we see one of them running down the street. Hes trying to catch up with us to let us know everything was alright, about 7 other cops showed up but let them all go for some very strange reason.
238	3	a	Well that was a little bit of a weake up call, most of my friends wanted to just go home after that, but I was rolling to hard to go home. So me and one other friend stayed out and roamed around, when we ran into these 2 girls we knew.
239	3	a	For some reason I was soo happy to see these people we barely knew, I was over social with them and I think they thought I was crazy. But we ended up spending alot of time with them. We got to know each other alot amd talked about our views of life and what was going on in the world. It was such an in debth conversation, all these feeling arouse out of nowhere, like me ego was stripped completely away from me, which was in a way, a very good thing. It allowed me to be honest, sympathetic, caring, and loving to everybody I met, and thats how I wanted to be able to feel without the drug. Finally the time came where I had to go home, my friends pill was wearin off and mine was somewhat also, but I was rolling harder than him, considering it was my first time and not his. So now its almost 11 and I get home. I go to my room and put on some music and sit and think about what I learned about myself and other people from the wonderful expeirience I had just lived through. Its over a year later now, and I have had zillions of other kinds of expeiriences with tons of different substances, but that night is still one of or maybe the most memorable and meaning night I have ever had. I recommend pure ecstasy for anyone trying to find there inner feelings on life and the people aroudn them.
240	3	a	I have done E about a total of 17 times now, and the mental effect is nowhere whatsoever near the height it was at that first time, which is why I'm deciding to not do it again considering I think it might damage my brain. But whatever the damage, One try was worth it for me.

The whole experience was fantastic..everything went real smooth, I had a little bit of dry mouth and my throat swelled up a little bit, but I kept drinking water in moderation (not too much, but enuough to make up for wat my body was losing) and everything went great, until the next day...
245	3	a	I'm not depressed, I'm not angry or anything negative like that. I just really really really want another hit like right now lol and I'm thankful I'm strong willed enough to tell myself no, to wait until the weekend. 
246	3	a	I'm not on any medications as of now (Non- Stimulant strattera, I stopped taking it about 3/4 weeks before my first hit), I was alone for my first hit as well, very relaxed and laid back and just blasted my speakers out with house music..it was crazy

249	3	a	Last friday I was able to get my hands on two ecstacy pills named 'Red Strawberries', never trying ecstacy I was kind of scared about hearing all the stories of neurotoxicity and all that nasty stuff. I also was expecting it to be somewhat similiar to Adderall.
250	3	a	6:00pm: ingested one pill on an empty stomach.
251	3	a	6:30pm: It hit me like a ton of bricks, my scalp and my skin tingled, I was getting warm rushes through my body, and one thing too add it was a little to intense at times, I got really dizzy and paranoid I was going to have a heart attack, but that subsided, I was in the car with my dad on the way to an NA meeting, I remember hearing the music on the radio and it was the greatest feeling ever, I felt so content and happy and I felt connected with the music. 
252	3	a	7:00pm:  My pupils were dilated and were like the size of dimes, very very huge, I noticed a lot of jaw clenching also.
253	3	a	After that the high was pretty level with all the positive effects I said above, not to forget I had real extreme feelings of love and emphathy for people. The comedown wasn't nearly as bad as amphetamines.
254	3	a	I am currently craving VERY badly to do more ecstacy, as it seems I have no where to find it, this is a hell hole, I almost regret taking it.

257	3	a	The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
258	3	a	A few days ago, I wound up snorting and eating what I was later told was about 3 to 3.5 grams of ecstasy over a period of around 24 hours. 
259	3	a	Based on my experience with this substance long ago (fifteen or so years), I can report that I am certain it was very clean, and there were no physical hangovers. I spent most of the time stretching, and had a mild sweat during which time I felt that I was flushing out deep seated toxins from my body through the E and the stretching. 
260	3	a	Two days after this experience however, I noted a kind of lingering dizziness which continues now, a day later. I noted a kind of lingering dizziness which continues now, a day later. It is a tingly lightness that doesn't feel bad, or weakening, but does remind me of the very early onset of a fainting feeling. There is no 'downer' mood alteration whatsoever - which I suspect has something to do with the cleanliness of the substance - but the fact that this dizziness has been going on now for about 36 hours, I am mildly concerned, but comforted by the fact that  this effect can continue for 'up to' 4 weeks in most cases. 
261	3	a	In any case, had I known that I would have this effect, which I now learned of afterwards, I certainly would not have ingested as much as I did.

263	3	a	MDMA (3) : Hangover / Days After (46), General (1), Unknown Context (20)
264	3	a	This past Saturday at around 10:00 PM me and a friend took a blue circular mint that was mdma. My friend rolls every few months but it has been a few years since the last time I rolled. Around 3 years ago I rolled 3-4 times and never had any problems. But this time I did. 
265	3	a	My friend started to feel sick to his stomach about 20 minutes after we took it, and almost vomited. But the nausea went away and he started feeling it. After about 1 hour and 20 minutes I suddenly got really nauseous and went to the bathroom and vomited quite a bit. I didn't see any of the blue pill in my vomit so I figured the pill had absorbed. I really didn't feel it like I thought but I think I still was rolling a bit. But all I wanted to do was sit in my room for the rest of the night. My friend who had taken the same pill as me rolled and felt great the entire night. 
266	3	a	The next day on Sunday I felt terrible, couldn't eat and had depression and anxiety occurring. Today is now Monday and I woke up feeling almost worse then the day before. Extreme depression and continuing anxiety, also I haven't eaten all day and still am not hungry. I am thinking about going to see a doctor because I just cannot put up with this feeling.

268	3	a	MDMA (3) : What Was in That? (26), Hangover / Days After (46), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
269	3	a	I started taking E in very calm settings about two years ago. It became more and more frequent, until I was rolling at least once per season before I decided to attend an actual rave. I was there for the music and it seemed a lot of people were there for the culture, so I decided raves weren't my thing. I don't even listen to electronic music normally. 
270	3	a	Then I tried going back to calm settings by myself which worked for a few months a couple of times up to this past month, where I rolled once every two weeks, the last being St Patricks day at my second and definitely final rave. I went to usher in a friend to the world of MDMA but obviously I wanted to roll a bit myself. I took 3 pills at 8pm, as opposed to my usual 2 pills followed by two more later on. The pills didn't have any magic, no euphoria, no empathy, no energy, no happiness. It was pure intense dizziness and vertigo mixed with irritation. I ended up sitting in my car for 4 hours smoking weed to make myself feel better before going home and having the worst hangover of my life from anything. 
271	3	a	I've gotten about 20 to 30 trips under my belt and it was great while it lasted, but it became terrible very quickly and is no longer appealing at all to me.

274	3	a	After a great night rolling on .6 (I felt wonderful and also took about 6 bong rips on the comedown which brought me to a whole nother level. I had wiggly eyes and everything) I got about 4 hours of sleep and worked for 8 hours on a super busy day in a restaurant. 
275	3	a	I didn't feel too bad at work but once I was home and with my significant other, I started to feel very depressed and layed in bed thinking way too hard about life and convinced myself life is going to suck. The next day I felt fine and completely happy with my life again until I got back from work. I started getting weird 5-second headbuzzes that felt good? Kind of unexplainable. And again, while I was laying in bed, things got pretty weird. I was looking at the ceiling (pretty dark in the room) and I started seeing visuals. The ceiling started to look like a pool of water that was wavy/ripply and wherever I'd look it would follow with where I pointed my iris. I also started hearing dishes clashing when I would get close to falling asleep. (That could just be from working too much.) 
276	3	a	I'm assuming these are all after effects of the mdma though since I had been sober since I took it.

280	3	a	A little background information to start off with.  My two friends and I are fairly experienced pot smokers, and have taken LSD on a few occasions, but what we really wanted to try was MDMA.  
281	3	a	We had planned this night for a while now and were very excited.  Before getting the pills we smoked a few bowls and drank a few beers, which may or may not have effected the outcome.  Anyway, at around 11 PM we got our 3 G-spot stamped pills and took them at 11:33.  Around midnight I began feeling warm inside while my two friends were not feeling anything yet.  Another half hour past and I felt at complete peace with myself and was very talkative, my two other friends still don't feel anything.  Finally at around 1 AM my friend L begins to feel it but M is still not feeling anything.  It really didn't get any better than this and at around 3 AM we all just felt completely tired and fell asleep.
282	3	a	The next morning we checked out pill data website and it turns out what we got was potentially simply MDA.  We felt it was a waste of our $20 (each) but are still excited to try the real thing.

285	3	a	When taking the drug I feel excited, and my problems and insecurities subside for the duration of the peak experience. I feel alert and can always have a great time out, the drug facilitates this. When 'coming down' from MDMA I gradually become paranoid and negatively self aware which makes being in public a nightmare. I will also say that the most annoying aspect of taking e is the rapid weight loss I experience, epecially in my face as my features appear extremely drawn and gaunt due to the drugs effects. I still gets cravings for ecstasy and I think this is more a 'craving' for the fun times I have had in the past. I like MDMA but don't like the comedown one bit.

288	3	a	This was to be my second time doing MDMA and my friend J's first. I had done Morning Glory seeds (to no effect), cocaine, mushrooms, and DXM before. J had done MG as well, along with Acid and coke, so we both have some background in phsychoactive chemicals. We had prepared a couple days in advance to do the MDMA, so our mindset and mood were both open.
289	3	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
290	3	a	I drove over to his house around 3 in the afternoon. He snorted one and ate one initially. I ate both of mine. We headed out on the road with me driving soon after to pick up some beer. The package store is only about 15 mins away and J was already feeling it by then. He was laughing and had a huge shit-eating grin on his face and couldnt stop talking about how awsome he felt. I hadnt started to feel it yet. We continued on driving down to a local plaza where J got out and promptly threw up. The MDMA was just starting to hit me then. I had the typical comming on signs of clenching of the jaw, and hot and cold flashes. We sat in the parking lot for a while and I started to get paranoid that people were looking at us. J said they weren't, but we left anyway. We got stuck in traffic on the way out and we were cranking the music just twitching and dancing about in the car. Music is one of the most wonderful things in life on MDMA.
291	3	a	When we got to the mall, I stopped driving as I was starting to get severely impaired. It was about 3 hour since we initially dosed and we decided to take the other 2 pills each. It was the perfect night out and J and I were having a blast. The moon and stars had just come out. All of a sudden J lifts his arms in the air and starts saying the puppet master had him. Apparently, someone in the sky had strings attached to his arms and was pulling them around. He asked me to tell the puppet master to let him go. I did and his arms dropped. Neither of us could see the puppet master, but we both beleive whole-heartedly that he was there, pulling on invisable strings. The puppet master snagged me a couple of times too, yanking my arms in the air. Everytime J would either tell him to let go or cut the strings. We spent the rest of our time at an awsome bar at the mall, enjoying the trip. When we went home later both of slept fine that night, but the next day I discovered I had been grinding my teeth and biting my tongue alot. Both were VERY sore.
292	3	a	All in all, it was a wonderful time we had on it. Both of us grew much closer to each other, talking about anything and everything. We have done it together a couple of times since and everytime has been extremely gratifying. Going to concerts is the best while on it. We have seen everyone from Flickerstick to Cold to Slipknot on MDMA and it was all great.

295	3	a	At my school they call it thizz... Thanks to Mac Dre. But I'm going to call it X. So about a month ago me and my friend decided we would try ecstacy and so we ventured to our nearest supplier and bought 2 red safeway pills for 30$. We thought it was a good deal and being that we were so exited to try it we bought it right away. With  the internet I had done research needed to know what exactly I was getting into and what I should do to prepare. So with a bottle in hand and a pack of chewing gum in pocket, I was ready to roll. Litterally. But once I had the water and was going to drop, I wondered about the authenticity of the pill and not knowing the dosage scared me a bit. And so I held on to the pill instead of taking it, for I was not as ready as I thought I was. My friend however did take the pill and had an awsome time. He explained it as the most perfect feeling of life in the world. So after watching him and seeing what it was like from a 2nd person's perspective, I was then ready to drop.
296	3	a	About a week later me and my buddy walked to the supplier after school. He had bought one pill and I had saved my pill from the last time. But still being very cautious I only took half of it and gave the other half to my other first-timer friend. I have to admit even though the effects were very faint I still felt very alive and real for once. And in the 4 hours that I had been rolling, I had felt a nice warm feeling of happiness in the world and felt alot more able to talk to people and get into conversations like never before. I felt like most of the people I was with had been rolling too, and that we were all feeling the same feeling in perfect harmony. I would even ask the question 'ya feel me?' almost every scentance... And they always said 'yes'... As if we were on the same page throughout the whole night. It was a very experiencial night and afterwards I felt like doing it again, only now I am ready to experiance the full effects of what we call 'thizz'.

299	3	a	The first time I tried Ecstacy was about 4 months ago. I had experience with a few other recreational drugs: cocaine and marijuana. 
300	3	a	I was with friends at a camping ground and it was a big crowd because we were there for an event. We had been drinking beer all day and spent some time in the sun. By the evening one of our friends showed up with the pills.
301	3	a	My friend I was there with split a pill with another friend, and I got .33 of a pill from another friend. After about 45 minutes, my friend was feeling the effects from her pill. I, on the other hand really didn't feel anything yet. I got another 1/2 of a pill. After an hour and a half, still nothing. I then took an entire pill. Within minutes I started feeling the effects. 
302	3	a	I don't know if there are 'better' pills than others when it comes to ecstacy. However, when the pills finally kicked in, I was in a very euphoric state. I found myself experiencing a lot of the stereotypical events that are experienced when taking ecstacy: chills, jaw clenching, increased alertness and sensitivity to touch. My friend and I got to the point where we were annoying other friends, we would touch each other's hands and exclaim 'you're so soft!!' 'Nooo...you're so soft!!' It was a fun experience. My heart was racing, I felt like I was at the top of the world. The euphoria spread throughout my entire body, however, the chills were unimaginable for me. It was a cooler night, around 50 degrees, and we had a fire going. I was so cold I couldn't get away from the fire. I would walk 20 feet and had to get right back because I was like ice. I had on jeans, shoes, socks, t-shirt, sweatshirt, and a jacket, none of that protected against the cold feeling caused by the drug.
303	3	a	The next morning I felt fine. No hangover affects from alcohol or racing heart, just a normal summer day to hang out with friends.

306	3	a	Thursday night I took half of an ecstacy tablet. I had never taken more than this dosage. I am not sure exactly how much MDMA and other substances are in each tab. I do know that some pills contain more than others. We classify these into three categories-a single stack tab, double stack, or tripple stack. Within these categories some are still stronger than others. Friday I took a whole double stack tab and Saturday I took two of these same tabs. While I was rolling everything felt good. I was experiencing all of the typical good euphoric feelings. However I noticed that in between each dosage (which we call 'powering up' around here) I was feeling worse and worse. Today is Monday and I haven't powered up since Saturday night. I have not been able to sleep well until last night and I completely passed out-in my clothes with the television and lights still on! Everytime I rise after lying down I am so dizzy. My head feels cloudy and I dont want to do anything that really requires m to concentrate. Lights have huge raiinbow colored rings around them and I keep twiching. While I sleep my leg or arm just jumps involutarily. It feels really wierd. I have been in a terrible mood and I've been snapping at people. When I first started I didn't notice any of these negative effets, but I can't help but notice them now. I feel like shit basically. Everytime after I power up, my throat becomes sore and I can't eat. I am going to lay off the ecstacy for a little while and see how long it takes for me to return to normal. If these negative effects worsen when I take it again, I'm just going to leave it alone because this just is not where it's at!!! :)

309	3	a	5:00 injested vitamin smoothies and took a two hour nap to prepare for an intense experience...
310	3	a	7:25 injested one stack but so small could have been half-stack 'purple keys' 1 each person. 160 lbs 5 10' 135 lbs 5 9' 
311	3	a	8:48 We smoked some strong medical cannibus to bring on the roll. Feeling a good indica cannibus stone but do not feel the classic ÂextacyÂ feeling expected. We ate before ingesting pills and wonder if this fucked it up. Still have some hope it will kick in. This 10 dollars is not going to waste.
312	3	a	10:59 The high is very strong and mellow. These are very good pills and definetly contain a lot of mdma for their small size. Opiate like very nice happy euphoria can be distinctly felt by both of us.
313	3	a	11:07 We loved these pills. Any more than one would be ridiculous. We have gained a certain respect for the chemical from this experience. Eating before definetly delayed the come-on but after about 2 hours it became the roll we wanted. 
314	3	a	11:14 Grinding of the teeth noticed and the lockjaw is not too enjoyable. A piece of gum does the trick.
315	3	a	11:39 Very fun ride would definetly want to do this again. Have not completely came down but am starting to drift back to the real world.

318	3	a	Well, its the next day, and I feel reborn. I had previously been very afraid to try ecstasy, but to my great surprise, It was a very fun and peaceful. I was at my friends property near a river and some friends had been doing this for the past couple of days, so I tried it. It was awesome, I felt nothing but pure peace, I was also drinking a lot of beer with no noticeable bad effects. I feel reborn today. No hangover present at all. One funny thing was when I got home at around 3:30 AM i walked out into my front yard, and sat down to look at the sky, my cat came over to me and I just kept petting him and telling him i loved him. I felt so connected to everything living, I was capable of empathizing with anyone or anything. It was a very personal but also a social experience, I will cherish this experience forever.

321	3	a	It was a panicky experience coming up, then sublime for hours.  I woke up the next morning and felt relatively cheerful, if a little fuzzy.  Only the fuzziness lasted until right before spring break (~6 days later).  When I finally got home (TN) from college (in AR), significant depression had creeped in.  I felt a lot of dread and some of that same panic (though without the same intensity) of coming up on the MDMA.  Nightfall upset my condition considerably, and the feelings hearkened back to my childhood fears, ones that were believed to have been overcome.  I've been given various times that it takes to overcome these weird feelings (most of them being around 2 weeks), but I have talked to my parents and am seriously considering going to see a psychiatrist.

324	3	a	Last year in September I took some acid. I was 22 years old and a skinny guy. I purchased some 3 x small card board tabs
325	3	a	Unsure of print or  Pattern. Me and a group of friend's were attending a music festival, I took my 3 tabs about 30-40 minutes from the festival at about 11.30am. I also should say I am a fairly experienced user of LSD with this not being my first trip.
326	3	a	I started to feel the effects as we walked threw the gates and past the boys in blue. It really did hit me hard, I walked with my friends and my one mate who I had tripped with before guide me into the festival, I remember a lot of things going ' klaidescope ' of whatever the spelling. It was really intense, everything was wobbly, and morphing like good acid should be, for a good 2 or so hours we walked around, meeting new people gathering supply's and just exploring, in that time I was just a mess, I don't remember much in that time. I don't remember much in that time. 
327	3	a	We came to the blue stage where some friends went one way some the other so me and a couple of people decided to sit around and wait. I remember sitting there talking to friends and constantly touching the grass,  at this part I remember two things:
328	3	a	1) there was a photo frame set up for people to stand in and it had the stage in the back ground, there was two girls dressed up, I would call them fairy girls,  I asked them to take my picture, one girl replied  'do you have a phone' I didn't really know what I was thinking I just wanted my picture taken and had this thought about me being in a picture in a picture. Lol. I salute the fairy's and sit back with my friends. 
329	3	a	2) Was my trip guiding friend saying something to me, I can't remember what it was but it cracked me up, so much I was in hysterics, I couldn't stop laughing for a good five or so minutes, the proper giggles it was good, what ever my spirit leader said did what he attended it to do. Good fellow 
330	3	a	From there we went and got food, I purchase two sausages rolls and tried to eat them both at same time whilst laughing with myself following my group around, another half hour passes and I come to a point I realise everyone else is dancing and I'm trying to eat sausage rolls. So I THROW my rolls down and dance in victory over those delicious pastry's.
331	3	a	Some time past partying and killing time we came to another stage sitting on the grass, at this point I fairly sore and was laying up and down looking at the clouds and feeling the grass, the clouds were making  triangle patterns into each other. Also there was another moment where I sat up having a cigarette with my eyes closed hallucinating the warmth of the sun made me feel like a golden orb of some sort. The moment past we danced some more seen more people walked around did plenty of things. My trip started to settle a bit and when we were standing at the back of the stage I could see the clouds all flare up like in a time lapse in a big circle all around the stage. It was magical. Over time my trip settled and I could have conversations more and just function normally.
332	3	a	Later in the night towards the end I dropped a cap, I was told to be MDMA, I had a mad rush of heat and threw up about 3 times I had a pretty bad experience from then feeling mainly sick. I surely did feel the M came up and was somewhat peaking on the ride home more then usual it was weird.  I got back to the hotel 12-1am that night and got warm.

336	3	a	I paired this with marijuana, it makes it a chiller roll, where I feel calm but awake, happy, sociable, and like theres not anything wrong in the world. I also am pairing with tobacco. Cigarettes are a must since I smoke already. I'm also smoking hookah which is a great social activity if you have a group. I might be pairing with Ketamine tonight as well. Overall, molly is an amazing trip. It's definitely on the top of my favorite list, and I will continue to use from time to time.

339	3	a	Most of the time after I take ecstasy I do not experience much discomfort,usually just a little shakyness and as most amphetamines sleep and eating problems. I could even take MDMA two days in a row and not expierience much pain, usually......
340	3	a	But there are times when about a day after I take the ecstasy I get symptoms of sickness, which is actually horrible withdrawl. My bones ache and I feel almost as if I were like 70 years old and trust me I've got about 52 years until then. My throat starts to hurt and I get horrible headaches that enable me do virtually anything. These 'crashes' do not always happen however and it may just be certain kinds of ecstacy that cause this. I usually 'chill roll' when this occurs and the MDMA gives me symtoms of some sort of pain killer.....

345	3	a	4th of July my friend calls me and told me he can get us some really really good X. So naturally me and my buddy Trevor bought..hoping they would be better than our last rolls.
346	3	a	We got em around midnight and my friend took his pill right away.
347	3	a	Waiting about an hour and nothing happend. I was thinking 'well damn we wasted another $20'. Bummer.
348	3	a	I went and sat at the computer for another half hour and my friend comes to me with an amazed look on his face and told me 'damn dude this shit was worth the money and the wait'.
349	3	a	So by then my parents are asleep and I go ahead and drop my roll and waited. About a half hour later I felt really queezy and I was close to losing my stomache. I was talking to the guy who got me the X and he said this was normal.(I didn't experience this with the roll I took a month before.)
350	3	a	So I go to the bathroom and wait to puke and one of my other friends called me. I was talkin to him for awhile and I got a rushing to my head. I told my friend to hang on because I was coming up fast..so I close my eyes and let it hit me. At that point I thought I was peaking. Not even close.
351	3	a	Now, my dealer only told me I should have 1 rush and I'd be peaking.
352	3	a	I had an over whelming rush of happiness as I called him back and told him it was the best. I walk to my kitchen to grab a bottle of water and I get another huge rush to my head. Even more intense than the last..and that's when I start freaking out.
353	3	a	My dealer is like a brother to me..and if it wasn't for him I wouldn't be typing this today.
354	3	a	I was telling him that it happend again and that I thought I was gonna pass out..and I thought I wasn't breathing and he told me it was all in my head and that I need to calm down.
355	3	a	I calmed down and the rush was over and I was telling him that I'm having a good time again. It wasn't over.
356	3	a	I continue talking to him and I get a 3rd rush. Even more intense than the previous 2. That was it for me. I thought I was dieing. I wanted to cry and I couldn't concentrate on anything. I was pacing back and forth very fast and my hallway was waving around and I was scared to walk down it. I was telling my dealer that I think I was going to tell my dad to take me to the hospital. (I don't freak with every drug..but when I experience the un-expected I do freak out.) I ripped off my shirt because it was getting hot and I had this rash all over my chest..and I spazzed big time. My dealer told me it was just from the heat and I trusted him.
357	3	a	Now my friend who I was rolling with was spaced out and when I walked back in my room he saw I was freakin and he helped me through as well. 
358	3	a	As soon as I got to the peak it was all fine. I felt good, danced the night away and confessed my love to everyone.. Lol.
359	3	a	Bad trips are bound to happen I think I have to tell myself that I already took the drug and there is nothing I can do to stop it. It's in my system..don't fight it. Let it hit me and be positive and I'll have a great time.

361	3	a	MDMA (3) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
362	3	a	I had just moved back home and got a job at a grocery store where I met my future boyfriend (lets call him bob), who was new to my town. We started dating and I did ecstacy alot when I was with him (he didnt do any, it hurt his back). 
363	3	a	One night I walked to his house on 2 pills after spending an hour playing lesbian with my best friend. Bob was already stoned as usual. I had to go home since it was about 1 am, so he walked with me. The e started dying down so I took 2 more because I was obviously horny and expected to find some way to make passionate love to my man without waking my mother. We were sprawled out on my  rediculously small couch watching heavy metal 2000 when my high came on. I started getting intimate, until I heared my mom get up and go to the washroom. Bob announced he wasnt in the mood anyway. 
364	3	a	We sat on my back porch and had a smoke. I suddenly felt extremely hot and took my top off. It didnt really faze bob too much anymore since I always removed a peice of clothing or two when I was on X. I now felt determined to get bob in the mood and find a way to screw me. I went down on him lightly for 5 minutes, not enough to make him cum but just enough to get him worked up. 
365	3	a	We made love on my backyard from 2:00-5:00am no breaks. In the end I realized my high stayed throughout the whole thing. It was preobably the best sex I've ever had and it's all thanks to my pills.

367	3	a	MDMA (3) : Sex Discussion (14), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
368	3	a	I decided today was a good day to try molly for the first time.
369	3	a	At 4:00 PM I swallowed 100mg of MDMA in the form of a gelcap. Shortly after, a friend picked me up to play some soccer. It
370	3	a	was hot out and I was worried that I might overheat so Ibrought some water just in case.
371	3	a	Molly still hadn't shown her face yet at 4:40 PM and we decided to pay my friend Cherek a visit at Panera. I copped a cup for a drink to hydrate myself. It was 4:50 PM at this point, and man, she came on fast. I'd told Cherek I was on molly and I was starting to feel it, no, definitely feeling it. I couldn't keep a smile off my face, I was so euphoric. The body high was tingly, warm, and pleasant. Similar to if I had drank a cup of coffee and taken 10mg hydrocodone. After spending thirty minutes at Panera, and decided to go to my friend Rice's house.
372	3	a	We arrive at Rice's house and I'm watching him play video games, I am mesmerized, really into it. At 6:00 PM, my friend Kenji
373	3	a	I notice the effects coming down at 6:48 PM. Kenji and I left Rice's house at 9:00 PM. I was totally sober at this time, and the best part, literally no comedown. Upon reading up some more on the MDMA comedown, I discovered there would be little to
374	3	a	no comedown on doses below 150mg. Anything above 200mg is relatively safe but will leave one with a pretty shitty comedown and some post-roll deppression.
375	3	a	All in all, this just might be my favorite drug, too bad I have to wait 2-3 months to roll again because the shit is neurotoxic.

377	3	a	MDMA (3) : General (1), First Times (2), Various (28)
378	3	a	The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
379	3	a	So this is my first report of any kind but felt this ROA deemed qualities that deserved to be expressed. I have a fairly good amount of experience with this substance and was looking for something a little stronger. Now, me being completely against using needles, I was searching for info on what the best way to take this substance. Snorting has been my preferred method because of the rush but after researching what was better ORAL or Insuffaltion, I decided that I needed to research rectal administration. Now I have searched the BIOAVAILABILITY of just about every illegal substance known to man and ecery substance seemed to say the same thing: Rectal bioavailability>%80. So this sparked my interest and got me thinking, I wonder 'What kinda info I can find on google about plugging Molly...' So I immediately go to google and search for some experience with this and came up with NADA!
380	3	a	Now this is where I got to strap on my Psychonaut suit and venture where no man has gone before. I was gonna shoot 'molly' up my A-hole. Now, I have plugged morphine, and ecstasy pills before but what I experienced was unlike anything I have ever done. I measured out roughly .75 grams into a syringe with water and shot all the liquid in my ass. The tiny bit of liquid that trickled out burned like a MoFo. After the initial rest period to keep everything in, I sat up and started to await the effects. They kicked in relativiely fast.
381	3	a	Within 5 min I was in another world. Trippin, All out body High. Intense rushes of euphoria. I was unable to form sentences. I would answer questions nobody asked me.  Everything was melting and morphing. It was a mix between LSD and MDA. I stayed like this for a good hour before I started being able to form sentences.
382	3	a	ALl in all, this was way more than I expected.
383	3	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
384	3	a	It starts with a numbness in my arms and face then travels to my eyes. I keep me eyes closed rocking back and forth with a blanket shoved in my mouth. My vision shakes rapidly from side to side and I clench my teeth. I sway my head side to side and smile because it feels so amazing. I have no sense of time or my surroundings. I am with friends one high two sober. I tell the sober girl that she is annoying and her eye brows are ugly. She leaves. I run around my house because I think I am as fast a flash. I return to the couch and apologize to the sober boy for being such a bad host. I do this repeatedly. I confessed that I am bi. I tell everyone that I love them. The other high girl cries because her at died that day. I hug her. The sober boy is her bf and holds her. I text my brother about how he doesn't love me and he is my entire world. He tells me he loves me and I will be okay. I bawl my eyes out. I tell my high friend that the sober girl and her are getting really close and I am jealous and I love her and miss her. She is jealous of my new friend and loves me. We are best friends. I make the sober boy sad by talking about loss and his dead father. I am tired but can't sleep. For a week after I feel nauseated. I feel tired. I feel sad. But not depressed like usual. While high I bit two pieces off my tongue and three off my cheek I cut my lip open cut my toe and pinched myself so much that my fingers burned my skin. I love Molly. She is my main bitch.
