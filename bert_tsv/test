2	Mushrooms - 1/8th all caps - 2nd time trying them
3	Before I even start, I have to say this was the most intense trip of my life, and yes I still am very new to psychedelics, however I love them so much.
4	I had had a really stressful day, but had also aquired an 8th of shrooms, all caps, maybe one or two little stems out of the whole bag. I don't mind the taste at all, but I was hungry so I threw them on a sandwich and started munching away. Directly as I take the last bite, my mother walks in the room, and decides she feels like talking to me, and this just builds up my stress, so I keep pushing away until she finally decides to leave (about 20 minutes later).
5	I go sit on my bed, only to realize they're already kicking in, my walls are a green hue, whereas in reality they are really a shade of blue. I then smile widely and start laughing uncontrollably. 'Oh man I am in for the trip of a lifetime.' is all I could think, and boy was I right.
6	I then proceeded down to the basement where I knew I'd have some privacy. I laid down on the bed in the basement and just watched the walls creeping closer to me, waving, and enjoying the tracers of every moving object. Infact, the tracers were one of my favorite effects of the whole night, simply because they were so strong the trail of my moving hand literally just seemed to float slowly behind.
7	I then go into a state in which I wouldn't call sleep, but almost nodding out, coming to every once in a while. At this point I'm having OEV's, seeing stars everywhere, especially on the carpet, and the closed eye visuals are just unexplainable at this point as well. I remember at one point 'waking up' only to find myself still in this nodded out state, which instead of freaking out, I just tried to enjoy and mess with the visuals I was creating/seeing. Eventually I came back to what you'd call reality, but it wasn't much of a reality to me at this point.
8	I shield my eyes from the light to create darkness and enjoy the rapid moving neon object, pictures, etc, that I am seeing. I slowly release my arm that is covering my eyes, while keeping my eye lids shut, and a picture of the devil capsizes my mind, and I start speaking words I am not controlling, I quickly think of God and give myself the power to overcome this. Surprisingly this doesn't scare me, and I am still in a very happy, laughy mood (odd thing was I think it was still 6.6.06 at this time).
9	I quickly return back to the nodding out state I was explaining about before. This time I don't even realize who I am.  I am forgetting where I am, what's going on, and everything; my mind as a whole, is just a mess. I quickly look around 'in my head' and see my personality broken down in a few (I don't remember I think it was like 5) different people. They are all doing their own thing, and I am some how observing them all from 3rd person. This is incredible to me, because I still have this sobor personality, while watching these images and such in my head. This fasinates me for what seems like hours, but really was probably not much longer then 20-40 minutes.
10	I realize I have to piss and go upstairs to use the bathroom. I turn on the light and I see star patterning everywhere every bathroom ficture changing colors vibrently, and the walls are just heavily breathing. I look at the mirror and basically feel as if I'm in another dimension. The bathroom is not a bathroom anymore, it's a box and I have control. I can almost feel like I have the power to turn the whole 'box' and it's just an amazing experience. My face when looking in the mirror is morphing into uncontrollably and rediculously odd images, stretching into positions I've never thought possible to see on really any drug. I observe myself more in the mirror and notice that my reflection is doing things that I am not doing, as if it were another person, I enjoy this very much and find it amusing as well.
11	My friend calls me and explains he will be here soon, so I decide to go outside and enjoy the decently warm, yet a bit chilly, weather and smoke a cig. I'm sitting in the middle of my driveway as he arrives, and I'm in that uncontrollable laughing stage once again. He's completely sobor and realizes fast that I am tripping hard as anything. We go inside and go back to the basement. The next hour or so consists of extreme tracers, OEV's, seeing multiple people when looking at my friend, I'd see him in like waves of tracers, and at one point I was unable to even speak words, just mumble nonsense. At that time as well I couldn't even understand what he was saying to me.
12	I love the mindfuck of psychedelics, and try and relax and think about my problems and my mind just doesn't seem to care, I'm too happy to want to worry about anything, I want to just enjoy the time I am having. I have a couple ecstasy tablets left, tested, MDMA, no meth, and my friend wanted one so I thought what the hell, I'm already completely messed, why not see how much farther we can take this. Surprisingly I didn't get much from the ecstasy, other then a nice chill comedown from the shrooms. Surprisingly I didn't get much from the ecstasy, other then a nice chill comedown from the shrooms. We later rolled a joint, and that quickly brought back the tracers and things were floating once again. I remember at one point looking at the bed and watching it wave around (like a water bed) and lifting almost as if a magician was doing some sort of illusion.
13	My friend decides to go to bed, it's now like 5:30am, and I'm tired, but not quite ready to sleep. I head upstairs to my bedroom and can't figure out what to do. Whenever I do any drugs really I end up having a tough problem deciding between things. So I bring up pictures from when I was in Ireland. I quickly realize I can manipulate the pictures to do basically anything I want. For example, the castle I stayed in, I brought that picture up, I could make all the trees waves, the water in the fountain move, and people walk around and cars drive away. It was incredible. I finally decide it's time to go to bed, and quickly fall asleep. I awake the next morning after only a max of 5 hours of sleep, feeling fine, refreshed, and sobor. 
14	Looking back at last night has made me realize a lot of things, I now am sticking to psychedelics, and for some reason, have even decided to quite smoking cigs, even though that didn't come up once during the whole trip, but somehow subconciously I just don't like them anymore.
15	Anyway, I'm sure there is much more I cannot remember, but I tried to do the best I could, there was definitely some high +3 occasions (such as the personality thing) during this trip, and I'd say the rest of the trip was a modest +3/+2. I absolutely enjoyed myself to the highest extent, and hope to soon repeat the experience.

17	Mushrooms (39) : Combinations (3), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
18	In late november my friend and I decided to buy 5 grams of mushrooms. They are called gold caps I believe. We split them in half and ate them at once. It was both of our first time and we didnt know how exactly it would be. We were excited to do them because it took forever for us to find them. 
19	We walked to the movie store and I returned a movie and I started feeling like I didnt belong in there and so did she. We left and started walking back to my apartments and to my suprise the ground was more vivid. I could see the smaller things more vividly more then the larger and it started waving up and down and side to side, what seemed to be a start of a good time it slowly went downhill. We got into my apartment gates and there was a long stretch of maybe 500 feet or so but it was like walking down a long hallway it looked a mile away. And for some reason I started feeling uncomfortable like everything I did wasnt right and I became slow and partially confused. I knew what was going on but I just felt like I wasnt all there. So we were talking and decided to go to the jacuzzi and sit in there. As were getting dressed we both noticed it took us like 15 minutes to put shorts on. (well in my case). 
20	Were finally ready and I start feeling sick and I start throwing up in the bushes out front.  Right there was where things started getting more confusing. Everything started bending and getting colorful. Truly it was amazing but the way I was feeling killed the whole 7 hours of hell. Were at the jacuzzi and I'm trying to feel better and make myself think better but thinking became a hard task and I couldnt get out of the grasp of fear and disorder. 20 minutes pass and both of us started feeling the same way. But we didnt know how long and far the effects were gunna go. I was thinking the best ways possible but nothing seemed to help. We both felt helpless and I tried analyzing everything because she had no clue what anything was. I felt the same but I tried making a reality out of something so unrealistic. 
21	We started making our ways to her house and I was trying to talk reality but like I said, reality was gone. Colors, waves, sound waves, anything that moved I could sense and anything I heard scared me. I had to get used to different settings. I didnt know if I wanted the lights on or off or the tv on or offboth were too overwhelming. So my friend tells her mom what happened and she flips out but shes a cool mom she didnt care that much, just to her suprise was the worst. She was sick so we tried to stay out of her hair. Everything was colorful and everything was like a circus with clowns everything looked like it was coming to get me and everything looked like it was coming towards me. The only thing that helped me overcome the living nightmare was the fact that everything passes and everything goes away. Seconds seemed like minutes and minutes seemed like hours and hours seemed like days. 
22	About 2 hours into it we went outside and it was raining and it looked like colorful crystals falling from the sky and they would reflect off the christmas lights. I was hungry but food tasted old and drinks tasted flat so my appetite was completly teased. The whole high lasted 7 hours and all I did was lay down for the most part of it. Colors spiralled around the room and faces bent and walls were wavy opening locks on a door was a challenge. I was hopeless, I felt like nothing, I felt weak but I felt determined to keep a positive state of mind. So we turned on americas funniest home videos and I remember watching one that the guy said this is what it sounds like when you rewind your cat and it just tripped me out cuz it sounded like rewinding a tape recorder but it was a cat. I guess overall it helped me get out of thinking I was in hell. 
23	After about 6 hours I started coming down and I felt better and started exploring everything. Everything was almost the same way it was but my cloudy thinking seemed to just dissapear time sped up and later became a memory. It took me about 7 months to try mushrooms again but I havent eaten as much at one time as I did then. On a personal level I prefer LSD over mushrooms because I didnt seem to have a cloudy mind on LSD. But the experience taught me to research things a little better before I try them. 
24	Mushrooms was the most intense high I've ever had and I never will have a high this intense again.

26	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Small Group (2-9) (17)
27	After trying Liberty Caps over 20 years ago then moving on to LSD (Purple Oms, Strawberries and the like), and not having had a trip in over 12 years, I wanted to try the new legal high of magic truffles. I ordered 100g from a company in Holland and boiled up 30g  to make tea. I had wanted my girlfriend to try psychedelics ever since I had met her and I was pleased that she agreed to do 10g - I did the other 20g. Massive feelings of raw energy on my part and my girlfriend had an entity contact experience with a gnome-like Tibetan (probably because we had the Bardo Thodol on hand in case of panic!). Strong visuals and very very friendly. I had had a bad experience on a large amount of Speed I had swallowed years ago and the psilocybin 'massaged' my soul quite a bit and really smoothed me out. Worth trying - as strong as mushrooms.

29	Mushrooms - P. atlantis (856) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
30	Um ca. 4 Uhr brach ich zu meinem besten Freund Haubi (11 0 7) auf, um 8 Uhr wollten wir uns Herr der Ringe im Kino anschauen. Als ich ca. eine halbe Stunde später dort ankam, tranken wir beide zuerst jeweils eine Tasse Passionsblumentee um einerseits die Wirkung erheblich (bis zu 100%) zu steigern und andererseits Horrortrips zu vermeiden (Passionsblume ist ein leichtes Antidepressivum und hebt die Laune). Kurz darauf nahmen wir jeder die Pilze, die wir ein wenig warmes Wasser eingelegt hatten, um das Psylocibin darin zu lösen, ein. Sie schmeckten grauenvoll und es reckte mich sehr. Auch Haubi schienen sie nicht sehr zu schmecken :-) Wir tranken noch ein wenig Wasser und danach machten wir uns auf den Weg ins Kino.
31	Schon nach dem wir sein Haus verlassen hatten und zur Straßenbahn liefen, setzten bei mir die ersten Wirkungen ein. Das Laufen war nicht normal, es fühlte sich irgendwie komisch an, irgendwie schwebend. Als wir in der Straßenbahn saßen, begannen sie richtig zu wirken. Haubi las aus dem Buch Nova Express vor und ich stand bereits wenige Sekunden später komplett daneben. Die Umgebung schien irgendwie auf mich zu zufliegen, in mich hineingezogen zu werden und es fiel mir schwer auf Haubis Worte zu achten. Auch die Leute (bis auf Haubi) kamen mir irgendwie fremdartig vor und ich kümmerte mich absolut nicht darum, wie ich mich bewegte und wie viel Aufmerksamkeit ich auf mich lenkte (ich hatten einen Zwang, mich leicht zu verkrampfen). Ich war irgendwie froh, als wir wieder ausstiegen, Bewegung tat gut; Jedoch war ich zu dem Zeitpunkt leicht desorientiert, ich wusste nicht so recht wo wir waren, die Umgebung kam mir sehr verändert vor und die Leute machten einen außerirdischen Eindruck auf mich. Zu dem Zeitpunkt war ich sehr froh, Haubi dabei zu haben. Als wir weitergingen, fing der Boden an zu wackeln und großflächig zu wanken aber nicht so wie bei Alkohol, sonder viel harmonischer und es war das Gehen absolut kein Problem für mich; Im Gegenteil, es machte mir großen Spaß. Wir gingen weiter und trafen einen Freund. Auch hier wusste ich nicht recht, was ich sagen oder tun sollte. Wir gingen in ein Kaufhaus, da der Bus erst ein wenig später kam. Naja, so viel später auch nicht, darum beschlossen wir, lediglich aufs Klo zu gehen. Dort tranken wir auch wieder Wasser. Wir gingen zum Bus und die Wirkungen hatten voll eingesetzt.
32	Als wir im Bus saßen (und auch schon kurz davor) musste ich über alles lachen und alle Dinge, Gesichter, Gebäude, Worte brachten mich zum Lachen. Für kurz dachte ich schon, ich hätte Lachgas genommen. Als wir vor einer Tankstelle in der Innenstadt hielten (Ampel), teilte sich die Tankstelle plötzlich in ca. 5  6 Einzelteile, die unabhängig voneinander herumschwebten. Auch davon musste ich unheimlich viel lachen.
33	Wenn man hinein will, muss man zuerst im Freien 3 Treppen mit jeweils ca. 10 Stufen besteigen. Wir gingen auf die Treppen zu, doch plötzlich bogen sich die Stufen noch Vorne und die Geländer nach außen. Es sah ungefähr wie ein Ball mit Stufen aus; Trotzdem war das Stufensteigen absolut kein Problem. Haubi kaufte dann die Karten (er war noch fähiger als ich das zu tun) und wir hatten ca. noch 2 Stunden Zeit. Also gingen wir in einen kleinen Bereich im Kino, der voll mit Spielautomaten und so Zeugs war. Auf dem Weg dorthin merkte ich erneut, wie sehr der Boden atmete und sich bog. Wir verbrachten einige Zeit damit, Geld in Spielmünzen umzutauschen (jaja, immer mit den Gesicht nach oben, gell Haubi!), was wir dann auch schafften, und danach fuhren wir mit einem Speed-Boat-Simulator. Das war sehr flashig und sehr lustig. Als wir wieder das WC aufsuchten, um zu trinken, stand ich da und beobachtete Haubi beim Trinken, dann sah ich jedoch woanders hin und plötzlich kamen aus den Fugen zwischen den Fliesen graue Fraktalformen hervor, die sich miteinander verbunden und herum wirbelten. Ich konnte meinen Augen nicht trauen (es war die erste Halluzination in meinem Leben), darum sah ich weg. Als ich wieder hinsah, wiederholte sich die vorige Szene. Ich war sehr glücklich über diesen Zwischenfall, es war beinahe das beste am ganzen Trip.
34	Sehr gut gefiel mir auch noch die halbe Stunde die wir in einem Art Hinterraum (in einer sehr weitläufigen Bedeutung) verbrachten. Dort atmete der Boden in meinem eigenen Atem-Rhythmus, die Wände tanzten und die 3 verschiedenen Türen wurden alle in unterschiedliche Löcher gezogen. Das war wunderbar anzusehen und ich redete viel mit Haubi. Auch das gefiel mir gut, denn ich hätte nicht gedacht, dass man auf shroomz so klar denken und reden könnte. Auch kleine Räume (Klokabinen, Waschräume, Lifte, ...) faszinierten mich total, ich hatte irgendwie ein verändertes Gross-Klein-Verhältnis und außerdem merkte ich hier immer die Optics sehr startk. Als der Film anfing, kauften wir uns noch Tacos (lecker!). Als wir in der Schlange standen kamen wir uns beide sehr fremdartig vor, nach dem Motto Wir gegen alle, jedoch ohne jegliche Aggression. 
35	Und dann kam ein weiteres Highlight: Die Lasershow! Sie war sehr beeindruckend, wir sahen bunte Korridore, flexible Formen und Gebilde, farbverändernde Gesichter und vieles mehr. Wir waren begeistert und ich musste (wie sollte es auch anders sein) sehr viel lachen. Der Film selbst war eher langweilig und sehr flach. Aber der Film davor begeisterte mich.  Alles war sehr lustig und ich musste viel lachen. Wir lachten beinahe 3 Stunden durch!! Meine Optik war schön und ich hätte mir alles nicht so lustig, schön und angenehm vorgestellt, wie es tatsächlich war. Und auch mein Zeitgefühl war sehr verändert, die 3 Stunden kamen mir wie mindestens 6 vor. Wir schlossen den Tag mit einer gemütlichen Tüte ab und Haubi übernachtete bei mir.

37	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
38	This was my second time trying shrooms. we chopped up the shrooms and made tea (mint tea, it was very good). the effects came on pretty quick, within 10 mins. we had the lights off, other than a tower with two black and one blue light. we had some Omm, DJ Shadow, and Infected Mushrooms playing (great music for trips by the way). I have trouble getting visuals so i closed my eyes. As a smooth womans voice sang on in the music I saw a beautiful naked woman spiraling upward in the middle of a DNA strand. As she kept spiraling, she slowly turned into my ex-girlfriend, which really freaked me out! My current girlfriend was sitting next to me and in my mind, I thought she knew what I was watching, I thought she was going to be pissed. 
39	My mind kept telling me I should be back with the other girl. The song switched and the womans voice was gone, taking the naked girl with her. I sat on the couch staring at the rug and found myself wondering what is it like to live the life of a rugof this rug?. I slid myself down to the floor and laid flat on the rug staring at the ceiling. My friends tried to talk to me and I told them to leave me alone, and treat me as if I was the rug. Someone got up from the couch and walked around me to the kitchen. I harshly yelled at them you dont walk around the rug when you need to walk over it! Dont F***ing walk around me. F***ing walk on me! I am the rug! On the way back they walked on me. I was so happy to find out a little more about the life of a rug. 
40	Then my friend wanted to screw with my mind and he said he thought my arm broke when he stepped on it. Before he finished his words, I felt my bones shifting as they broke apart. I looked to my arm and saw a bump as the bone pushed up on my skin. I sat there telling myself, you are tripping, your arm is not broken, your arm is fine, rugs dont even have arms, I dont have arms and therefore how could it be broken. I laid back and watched the ceiling fan move to the music. I then realized that all day, everyday, with no choice, the rug and the ceiling fan look at each other. I named the fan Garry and began to talk to Garry about his life as a fan. I asked what he thought about the rug and if he thought we were good people. Hours had gone by, by this point and I was beginning to come down. I got up and set up my hookah. I spent the rest of my trip laying on the rug smoking my hookah with my girlfriends friend. I felt so content and so bonded with this girl. I felt as if id known her forever and that we were best friends (which is funny cause I never used to like this girl). All in all, it was a great night.

42	Mushrooms (39) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
43	I was reading up on the history of mushrooms this evening, and i came accrossed some information concerning the treatment of cluster headaches and migraines through psilocybin and LSD.  I have only eaten mushrooms 4 times, all in the past month.  I have eaten various doses of them, from a little over three grams, to less than to grams.  I have eaten them in various settings, from a concert, to a home, to a small apartment. The particular experience I would like to talk about was at a friend's home. We had blacklights on, and The Doors, the greatful dead, and some drum and bass house music is what we choose to listen to.  Two out of four people present ate mushrooms.  We had a good time.
44	what i really wanted to talk about was my bodily experience.
45	I experience terrible headaches of the migraine sort.  The only type of headache i have ever had are migraines.  I often pop my neck and back to relieve tension.  I find when i am on mushrooms that i am very easily able to pop my neck several times in each direction without any pain at all.  I'm not really sure this has much to do with anything, but I figure for research purposes, anything helps.  I will definitely keep track of my frequency of headaches since i have used mushrooms.
46	I have found the last two times that i have used mushrooms (less than 2 grams of penis envy mushrooms) that i have had an eye opening spiritual experience.  I discovered a lot about myself, and I learned a lot about the world around me this past weekend.  To me, using psychoactives is a very rich spiritual journey.  I have had scary trips too, but in the balance of the universe, there is no positive without negative.  I want anyone who reads  this to be very careful and extremely responsible when using drugs of any kind, Take care of yourselves, and thank whatever God you pray to for these wonderful gifts he/she has given us. Oh, and don't think too hard or you'll have a crappy trip.

48	Mushrooms (39) : Health Benefits (32), General (1), Not Applicable (38)
49	One night me and my girlfriend were sitting around and we were about to watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas so I busted out my shrooms and began munching away. About 30 minutes later I was already in the full swing of my high. While I was tripping out my girlfriend and I started messing around and I began to eat her out. While I was eating her out I began to see a rainbow of colors all flowing towards me. They started out slow but gradually got faster and faster and the colors got brighter and brighter except for a circle in the middle of all the colors, this was just a black sphere. Soon enough this black sphere began to take different shapes and the shapes seemed to change every time my girlfriend moaned. I saw a dog chasing his tail at one point. All of a sudden these images stopped but the colors kept going. Just as my girlfriend was about to orgasm, Jesus showed up in the black sphere. He had his arms out and he had a huge smile on his face and it seemed as though he was nodding at me with his approval and sure enough as soon as my girlfriend orgasmed he disappeared.

52	I was excited to once again enter the world of tripping. This was my second time on shrooms. Me and two other people were more than prepared for this trip. This was my boyfriends first time tripping. I smiled and comported his nerves as he gazed at a mushroom that was to make him loose all control of himself. We all dipped our shrooms in some peanut butter to lessen the vial taste, and 'chowed down', the trip started out a little shaky for my boyfriend: 
53	He soon calmed down and gently let the feeling take over his body. The next three hours were nothing but laughter and amazement. My boyfriend began to weep with laughter as he explained that hes not being mean, but our other friend really looked like a frog. This was the peak of the trip. 
54	As we all came down, we all felt a feeling of peacefulness, and love, remembering things like how nice it was to be little and to cuddle in our mothers arms. As we came down, we decided to smoke some MJ to ease back down and then hit up the local gas station for some beverages. But as we leave I have a feeling that I need to sit down, I immediately stop and sit at my kitchen table. I look at my boyfriend and said, I think somethings wrong' but nothing came out of my mouth. The next thing I see is both of their faces in a slight terror and I ask, What happened?' As I regained myself, I heard my boyfriend say, honey you had a seizure.

57	It was Thanksgiving, and I had been very excited to see my cousin's once again simply because I knew they did drugs and I was interested if I could get ahold of any magic mushies. Over the previous few weeks my 2 friends and I wanted to trip.  So I arrive at my cousins for Thanksgiving.  I get on the subject of drugs not wanting to rush into the shroom topic.  After a few minutes of a conversation, I popped the question, 'Do you know where I could possibly get any shrooms?'  To my suprise my cousin answered 'As a matter of fact I have a lil more then an 8th' I was so excited immeditly we left the house and went to go get the shrooms. 
58	About 30 mins later I was dropped off at my house with the shrooms I thanked him. I quickly dashed into the house to call my friend. He came over and we called our other best friend.  On his arrival we ate the mushrooms. Just sitting around waiting for the magic to kick in we began to roll a zig.  After it was finished we went outside to have a smoke.
59	Bout half way thru the zig my friend started to trip and noticed stange figures in the yard.  He started to speak about the universe and saw an elf.  He becamed worried so me and my other friend took him to my room.  There I began to trip, I noticed the posters in my room began to move and become life-like.  Then I heard my front door open.
60	I realized my mother had just got home from the Thanksgiving dinner. I was worried and panicy but still tripping. She came in my room and asked why it smelled like smoke we all replied we didn't know, after realizing my mother did not know we were fucked up, me and my friend went and spoke to her.  Still tripping bad, I had fun talking to her and so did my friend.
61	Minutes past and we decided to go to my friends house where we would end up staying the night, and we got in the car the outside world was nothing I recognized.  Reaching my friends house the shrooms begin to hit me hard. I was now seeing colorful patterns everywhere and the walls were beating like a heart.  I stared in amazement.  I felt so happy, everthing was great and so colorful.  The room was decorated in black lights and fake cob weebs we saved from Halloween.
62	My friends was tripping thinking he has a mass swarm or ants on his head, he said he needed ant killer RAID.  Next thing we knew me and my friend were tripping thinking we were in a nintendo game and our other friend was the devil.  We kept transforming with horns and he had a red shirt on.  We both became scared and told him to remove the red shirt.  He came back and his lil brother came into the room with a Scream mask on and was tripping me out so bad.  We started to rip away and pillows and take out the fluff. It was so soft it felt like a life saver.
63	After tripping for 2 hours now, I noticed I lost track of time thinking it was bout 1 am in the morning, I looked at the clock to notice it was only 11 pm I was amazed.  I felt like taking a piss so I entered the bathroom, after done I washed my hands and my face. I briefly looked up in the mirror to see my friends lil brother with a knife cutting off a stuffed bunny's head, I felt scared but knew I was only seeing things, but I turned around and it was real. I quickly ran to my friends room with his brother on hot pursuit of me I jumped in his bed.  My friend kicked his brother out of his room.
64	After a few minutes I felt the shrooms wearing off, so I suggest we roll another zig, my friend rolled 6 for us, 2 each.  He began our journey out to my friends barn, we all stopped out side the doors of the barn and started in amazement.  The barn was gigantic growing as we spoke, it looked bout 50 ft high in the air.  A bit scared we entered the second floor of the barn, and lit the candles, as I begun to smoke the zig, I became very buzzed and felt the best I had all night very warm and happy.  
65	I glanced over to my friend, to notice he was in a deep trance.  He began to moan in pain, I questioned what was happening, and he said it was far to scary to explain.  My other friend began to get the same trance, but deeper.  He became very depressed and sad looking. Minutes later he came out of his trance and we all finished smoking.
66	All of us had ended our trips and were completly sober.  As we climbed the ladder down the stairs and out the barn door, we discussed we should now do.  As we were walking towards the house I saw a deerlike figure dash across the grass, and let out a scream, my friends were startled and ask me what I was screaming at.  As the thing came back into the house they got scared very bad.  The 'thing' ran very fast but made no noise and left no tracks. We had no idea what it could of been knowing we were in the middle of the city and deer do not come around.
67	As we started to put the puzzle together, I remembered that last thanksgiving a year ago, a goat had been slaughtered by some type of animal.  I told my friends and they also became scared and remembered.  We still don't know what it was, knowing that every Thanksgiving that creature must come back for something.  So that was one trip that was quite amazing, I can't wait to do it once more.

70	First time, taken in very alien place to home thousands of miles away in mountain town near east coast in early colonial town which spawned several American historical figures. Taken with new but very trustworthy individuals who had grown them. Eaten with ricedidn't even taste them. taken as thunderstorm rolled in. At first everything was just funny, but then the storm and the real voyage rolled in. 
71	Eventually realized that it was time to leave the house where we took them and wander around strange town with my permanent companion. New realizations and connections to nature and my animal-being on this earth. Drinking water from a leaf seemed completely natural, and I could feel the cycles of nature all around. Also realizations and release of guilt held within self about ancestors conquesting the nation and suddenly feeling the essence of all of human evolution. No justification, but a realization of where I fit in and how all of history relates to the present, and a feeling of understanding at the beauty that the first voyagers to America must have felt while at the same time somehow easing my guilt and feeling a connection to native Americansan embracing of all life and realization that things are not always easy, but we are all of the same.
72	Plants were of severe interest and I saw an entire bed of bushes as many copies of one same busha huge garden of exact replicas of the same bush. Plants were very close to me and seemed to be friends of mine as people are. Eventually realized that making out with companion was a must, so we tried it and enjoyed it very muchAll touching was strange as if feeling what touching as a sense was like for the first time. Both of us very wet from the rain that was constantly happening, but not minding one bit. 
73	Eventually found our way back and found our friends. Talked a bit and wandered around the house. Went back to sleeping quarters and as effects were beginning to dwindle talked with companion and then had some of the best sex ever both of us agreed. Went to sleep feeling somewhat confused at all of the information gathered, but very satisfied and enlightened. One of the best nights ever and the positive effects are still with me everyday.

75	Mushrooms (39) : Nature / Outdoors (23), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
76	Setting~ In Roosevelt mall, mainly in a small hallway beside Spencers that was fairly well lit, painted gray and white and with a portion of the floor that was slanted (this will be significant later on)
77	Onset~ After sitting in the food court eating my burger, me, Lisa, Casey, and Chriss went out the exit next to express to have a cigarette and wait. Lisa and I were the only two who ate the burgers and Casey and Chriss were there to babysit us just incase anything happened. Outside we met a really tale guy with green hair who worked at Spencers (he shows up again later). While me and Lisa sat on the ground waiting, I noticed that I was getting the chills every now and then. Nothing too intense but mild chill feelings. Casey was trying to test to see if it had started by lighting a lighter semi-close to my face...if I twitched, then it had begun, but if I didn't think twice about it, then I was fine. But about the third time Casey did this, I jerked back a little and giggled...it had started....so after smoking another cigarette we went inside to hang out and play. This is where my day all begins.
78	Coming up and plateau (in the hallway)~ I'm not so sure about the actual order of the following events, but I do remember how I felt quit clearly. I remember going into the exit hallway next to Spencers to smoke a cigarette and this is where it really took off. As I sat on the floor smoking my cigarette I noticed the orange and red burning embers were so much brighter and bolder than usual, but I didnt think too much of it. Then when it came time to put it out, I flicked it at the wall, but as I watched the butt fly through the air and hit the wall, it looked as if a tiny firework had just been lit. After seeing this, Lisa and me looked at each other in amazement, ran over, picked up the still semi-lit cigarette, and flicked it at the wall again. We laughed so hard and we were so amazed at how cool it looked. We continued to flick the cigarette until it was totally 100% out. 
79	Then I remember sitting on the floor and looking at my hands, I could see through my skin. I could see the places where liver spots would develop and I could see every little vein in my hand. I sat there and studied my hands and my bare feet for a while. Im not sure how long, but I know it seemed like a while. 
80	Later on in the day I was standing on the slanted part of the floor (I told you this was significant) I was standing there facing the slope, and as I stood there I felt as if I was falling backwards, but then I noticed that I felt too weak and I was slowly walking backwards. Gravity seemed to be forcing me down the small incline. I found this to be absolutely hysterical. 
81	Casey and Chriss were watching and entertaining Lisa and me for a while. Casey had found a broken chair from the food court that only had two back legs. He sat on it, and held his weight on his front feet, so it looked to Lisa and me as if he was floating. We were so bugged out about the fact that we couldn't figure out how he did it. Both of us attempted to float like Casey did; yet we both fell trying. The entire time we were laughing our asses off.
82	All day while we were in that hallway, I chained smoked cigarettes. The space of time in between my cigarette seemed to take forever, yet in reality they were only about five to ten minutes. I didn't go through a few packs of cigarettes, but I most definitely was smoking more rapidly than I usually do. And with every cigarette that I smoked, I would notice something new and cool about it. 
83	Casey was smoking a cigarette by a light, with much intrigue I watched him inhale and exhale the smoke. He turned and noticed me looking at him funny, so he tried to bug me out (again)...he asked me what color the smoke was and what it looked like. I replied by telling him the smoke looked dense and brown instead of white and fluffy. I noticed there was a hint of green in the smoke. He told me that I was seeing what the smoked really looked like and that all the colors were tar and chemicals. I was grossed out at the fact that I could see the tar in the smoke, yet it was laughing so hard.
84	The guy we met outside with the green hair came into the hallway for a cigarette break. We talked to him a little about his job and stuff. he was really nasty. He punched the walls (which were made of cheap plaster) until a whole was formed. He punched the walls so hard that his knuckles were bleeding. I thought the color of the blood was sooo pretty, but still gross. After noticing the blood he held up his hand and licked it. ewwwww. I felt my skin tighten up at the very sight of that, but I didn't bug out about it. He went back to work and said he would be back later on.
85	While he was back at work in Spencers Casey continued to mess with my head...in a good way of course...but it still bugged me out and made me laugh my ass off. He would wave his hand in my face in a very melodic and rave like way, each time he did this I would zone out for a sec and then flinch when he moved too fast. His hand looked too ill. He would also point out things to me, like little spots on the wall and asked me what color they were. He pointed out an old fan in the wall above the doors that lead back out into the mall. The fan had two strings hanging from it that Casey swore were grayish and greenish colors. Yet to me they seemed to be bright ass blue and pink. 
86	Later on the green hair guy came back. We hung out with him for a little until he had to go back to work again, he told us to stop by later in which we told him we would. Remember this part later cause this involves going out into the mall (which happened once me and Lisa got bored of the hallway, although that seemed like it was a really long time later to me).
87	At one point in my peak, I sat on the floor in front of Lisa and we sat with our legs out and feet evenly together. She was dazing into the floor, I called her name to show her something cool but she didn't look up. I must have said her name like 5 or 6 times until she looked up at me. When I finally got her attention she rotated her head slowly upwards at me and said 'huuuuuuh' in a groggy type voice. When she gazed up at me I saw her lip slide off her face and hit the ground. Casey had warned me earlier about people faces twitching and moving when they weren't supposed to, so I found this to be the coolest thing I had ever seen. And then as I stared at her face for a while it seemed as if the skin around her chin and neck was melting. It wasn't like something in a movie, it just seemed as if it was trying to crawl off her neck. I bugged out with hyperactive energy and tried to explain to her what I was seeing. She was lying on her side laughing so hard at what I was telling her; needless to say I was laughing my ass off as I tried to tell her about it. This little bug out session was so intense yet it didnt last long. My attention span was getting mighty short. So we wondered out into the vast mall.
88	Coming up and plateau (in the mall area)~ We ventured out into the mall after a while. We were walking around, Im not so positive where, but we wondered the mall area by the fountain in front of sterns. As soon as we came out of the hallway I notice that everything was so bright. Not bright like the sun where I had to squint my eyes, but brighter in a way of the colors. Everything seemed so heavenly looking. The walls and lights looked so much whiter and clear. The colors from stores and people we more intense. Each distinct color was noticed and appreciated.
89	While we were walking we bumped into a girl I know named pip, and Lisa and me exploded with energy and were telling her about what we had done. She has so excited for us and a little bit jealous at the same time. Yet nonetheless she was happy to see us. She had told us that Diana was in the mall with a friend of hers and she had just seen them.
90	Later on in the day we went to Spencers. This place was like heaven. I was in the black light section and I was off in my own little world. Everything was so cool, all the lasers and little special effect lights had my full attention. I wondered around for a little bit in the store by myself, until I heard Lisas hard gut type laughter. She was in the front of the store with Casey. He had yet again started to mess with our heads. 
91	When I was in the black light section he called out to me and when I turned around he was all the way on the other side of the store motioning for me to come over there. But then I turned back the other way and almost instantly he was behind me and tapped me on my shoulder. It seemed almost like he ran up at me. This too was very funny.
92	Later on in the front of the store with Lisa and me, Casey was trying on all sorts of wigs and hats. He had put on a big ass afro and funky sunglasses, I wanted to die then and there, he looked so funny. 
93	Back in the black light section he was playing with all of these toys and making our visual effects seem so much better. While we were playing back there, the green hair dude came back over. We asked him if he can steal us stuff and put it in the hallway so we could pick it up. He agreed and stole us some ozzy osborn figurines and a strobe light (I loved that strobe light J).
94	After a while of playing in Spencers we went back out into the main mall area. We spotted Diana and Vicky and ran over to say hello. Lisa and me were so excited to see them. I had to pee, so Diana went with me to the bathroom to make sure I didnt get lost. I did what I had to do and then flushed the toilet (like everybody does) but when I flushed I noticed it sounded funny so I turned around and flushed it over and over laughing hysterically every time. I came out of the bathroom sometime later and looked in the mirror. ooo boy was that ever a big mistake. As I gazed at my reflection, I could see the veins in my face and I noticed that my skin was so red looking. I could see every little imperfection and flaw in my skin. It didn't bother me that much but I thought I looked so nasty and sick-like. I backed away from the sink and leaned against the wall by the hand dryers while I waited for Diana. As I was leaning against the wall one of the hand dryers came on. It scared the shit out of me and made me leap to the other side of the bathroom; it seemed so sudden and loud. But then I chilled out cause I remembered that they were automatic and that this one wasn't trying to get me. Diana was laughing at me so hard cause she said I was being so bugged out and funny. She said I was in a world of my own and I was loving it. Which I was. After my time in the bathroom we walked back to Spencers to meet up with the rest of our crew.
95	Lisa and me felt as if he were compelled to go marvel at the lights and colors of the food court...so we did. We probably walked around it like 5 times pointing out every new thing we saw. I remember I had a funny taste in my mouth so I got a drink, but I was so far from being hungry you have no idea. I would not even begin to try and think about food. I dont think I could have sat still for the time long enough to eat. J
96	We walked back down to go outside and smoke a bone. We had to pass the big fountain to get to the door and when we did I happened to look down at the floor. The tiles around the fountain were glossy and showed the reflection of the large skylight above. I thought to myself that if I went through the floor then I would end up on top of the skylight; so I bent down to see if my hand would go through. Casey saw me do this and he laughed a little and then we continued to walk outside.
97	Coming down~ I didn't really start to come down until the bus ride home. But the bus ride was so unforgettable. 
98	The four of us sat together, which would change later because Casey and Chriss were embarrassed to sit with us...me and Lisas hearing was still on it's peak and as we sat in the bus we could swear that we heard the people in the car next to the bus talk. It was the funniest thing. 
99	Also while on the bus I can remember talking to Lisa about how I felt as if my high was slowly fading. I was so upset at the fact that I knew it was ending. She agreed with me on this. So we both sat there trying to make ourselves bug out so we would feel like we did before. It seemed to work but we still couldn't fight the fact that in a few hours it would all end. 
100	As we sat on the bus and continued to talk and giggle, Lisa and I both could hear a girl singing and then we looked to the back of the bus, there was only a few people there that were talking. But to me and Lisa it seemed as if the volume of their voices were loud enough to get the drivers attention while driving. So I guess Lisa and me were the loudest ones on the bus. We felt that we had to speak louder so we could hear each other over everybody else. And it turns out that everybody on the bus was staring at us. This is the reason for Casey and Chriss to move. 
101	We finally got home and we were dropped off by a bar next to the train station called Rockwells. After calling our parents we walked up onto the train platform and sat down. Casey and Chriss were still down by the phones. I can recall me and Lisa talking about how useless we felt. We talked about how we didn't want to move for anything and how impossible it was to get up from the ground. Our bodies were like mush. We sat on the ground and watched the trains go by. Our visual effects had basically gone away. But every now and then lights would get a little brighter and things would move a little funnier, but it didn't last long.
102	I finally got home, I still felt a little funny but I was sober enough to be around my mom (thank god). But my mom wasn't home. I looked in the mirror that night and studied my pupils, they were getting bigger and smaller. One would grow and the other would shrink, this happened for a while, but I didn't really care. All I could think about was the next time I would do that again and how much I couldn't wait. That was the best day of my whole lifewell, kinda. J

104	Mushrooms (39) : Guides / Sitters (39), General (1), Various (28)
105	We were 7 people in a park, most of us first-timers. Dose was one of those bags you can buy in the Netherlands (took them from there).
106	First thing to note, even though I think it was a relatively high dose (an experienced tripper confirmed it so after the effects), the travel is really progressive, I don't really notice how it's filling me and changing my whole reality concept.
107	The first hour was the real hallucinogenic one; colors intensified and reality seemed to... expand? everything clear, as if conscience feeling it was cleaner; the park turned out to be a faery forest, and though it was just a 'whole hallucination' I wouldn't have been surprised if I saw any elves or so :). Grass was alive, behaving like green waves, and reality felt like if I have put on the Master Ring (well, not that much, but maybe one of the minor ones ;) )
108	When this new state began to become habitual, after an hour we started, then the internal fight came. I think shrooms somewhat make your psychologic mind nude, try to kill the logic mind and wake up consciuousness. But you've got to fight against your own mind and trauma. I visited my infancy, and in a fetal shape I cried for some forgotten things that are still hidden in my subconsciuous, that I had to fight.
109	I accepted them, I understood them, and abandoned the fetal posture. Looked around, at the people tripping with me, at the trees, leaves, branches... and felt and indescriptable peace, as if the child inside had arose,... at last, you're here, you're nothing, you're you... and a light but deep feeling on beggining to understand through peace of mind...
110	That happened in little more than an hour. When peace came, I (and some of the group joined as long as they finished their mental fight, somo earlier, some later) started rediscovering the world, as if I was born again. Everything was so intense... but it's so intense because no 'ego' was there to judge it, to attach emotionality to things; things just were, and for hours I observed it, amazed...
111	Some hours later, the trip finished. Slowly, smoothly, the ego barriers, the self, the emotionality attached to things, came again ... at least, magic shrooms showed the way.

113	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
114	I began the night thinking that the mushroom gods might not be favoring me on this particular evening, and if they weren't they soon changed their minds. My fellow trippers and I ate the mushrooms as soon as we got them. I ate three grams, as did my friend Kancer. This was at about 11:45 pm. Betty and Veronica(not their real names) each ate one and a half grams. The mushrooms kicked in really fast, I could feel them starting within twenty minutes. At the half-hour point I was well on my way, as was everyone else. We decided to make our way downstairs to smoke some herb. We smoked a bowl and sat listening to 'We Can Dance' by David Bowie. We noticed that Veronica was missing, it turned out that she went out somewhere. We went upstairs and tripped out a bit, and Veronica returned fairly soon, She went out with another girl and picked some flowers. We went back downstairs to smoke more pot, now joined by two more people. We smoked a bowl while we sat their with our thoughts, spiraling through the universe and its fantastic possibilities. I remember having a discussion about colors, and if black and white are colors, and if there's such a thing as an anti-color. 
115	I realized how good it was to do mushrooms with a group of people, lately all the trips I've gone on have only been with one other person. It felt better this way, like the circle was complete. I noticed a peculiar phenomenon while we sat there in the dim lighting, I noticed that I could see my fellow trippers very clearly, but the two people who weren't on mushrooms sort of faded into the shadows. We finished the bowl and went upstairs we tripped out for awhile and decided to go to my house. We went upstairs and slowly got our things together and got ready to go. Once we left, at about 2:00 am,we went down to the riverbank right by Betty and Veronica's house and started on the path towards my house. We talked about mushrooms and told stories as we walked. We talked about my first mushroom trip, which both Kancer and Betty participated in as well. It was good thinking about things like that. We soon came to a place where the paved path went one way and a dirt path started. We decided to follow Robert Frost's advice and take the road less traveled. As we made our way along the path it started to go down into a sort of ravine, the ground was muddy and it was slow going, but we got to the bottom and found a small stream that ran into the river. We crossed it and climbed up the other side. We continued on for awhile, in silence. I felt a cool breeze on my face and breathed in the fresh night air, and I felt extremely peaceful.
116	Eventually, not too far away from the train bridge near my house, we sat down to rest. I packed a bowl and we looked at the sky. There was a lot of stars visible that night, and northern lights as well. We sat looking at them for awhile, and I felt very privileged that the powers that be felt us to be worthy of witnessing this spectacle. It was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. We were mostly surrounded by nature and it was easy to ignore the city and, for awhile, I was able to forget or pretend that human beings never existed and never fucked up the earth and never did all the bullshit that we as a species have done. It seemed like the northern lights were surrounding us like some kind of protective aura, generated by our heightened energies, and I felt like I had a place in the universe.
117	Kancer sat and beat-boxed, while I thought about myself and how I can better my life and the lives of those around me. I realized that I need to stop being so serious about pot, and LSD, and mushrooms and harmalines and whatever, and not be so spiritual about it all the time. I realized that I need to enjoy things more and have some fun. We soon decided to continue, right after a train crossed the bridge. We continued in silence until we got to the bridge and started to cross it. We slowly made our way across, stopping frequently to admire the water or the sky or the city stretching out before us. We eventually got to my house just a few blocks from the bridge, and it turned out the journey only took half an hour. We went downstairs and smoked out of my hookah and talked about all kinds of subjects while we listened to the 'Aqualung' album by Jethro Tull. Eventually, my girlfriend got home, at about 4:00 am, and we gave everyone else a ride home. Once we returned home we smoked a bunch of weed and listened to Jimi Hendrix's 'Are You Experienced?' album, before going to bed. I woke up the next day and began writing about what might have been the best trip I've ever had.

119	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
120	To introduce myself, I am a white male, age 17, and my previous drug experience include AMT, DPT, DXM, 2ct2, marijuana, xanax, alcohol, caffeine , nicotine, bzp, 5meodipt, 5meodmt, salvia, ether, kava, adderall, ritalin, and a few other substances I can't quite remember at the moment. This was my first trip with psilocybin mushrooms. I've had pretty positive experiences with psychedelics prior. 2 previous unpleasant trips had occured, both on AMT, during a time of great stress in my life, having problems with former gf, etc. I'm not a particularly spiritual person in the traditional sense and consider myself an atheist. I use psychedelics for the purposes of gaining insight into myself and my reality and for general recreation. I've been diagnosed with 3 mental illnesses which I don't believe to be accurate: Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, and minor OCD. 
121	This report is from a trip on psilocybe cubenis several weeks ago. 
122	Bought 1/2 an ounce (14 grams) of some, later to be discovered, very unpotent mushrooms from a fellow at work with the intent to ingest them sometime that week. About 3 days later, Saturday, I talk a walk to the local convience store and get some OJ, a pack of marboro, and a weekly world news, and walk home. I divide out about half of the mushrooms (Approximately 7 grams) and take a sip of OJ, put the mushrooms in my mouth and begin chewing. Orange juice completely kills the somewhat earthy not too unpleasant but far from appetizing taste of the mushies. Take about 5 minutes to thouroughly chew and swallow all the mushies. About 20 minutes begin to feel the familiar tryptamine buzz. I put on a Parliament Funkadelic compilation CD. After about 30 minutes I feel them completely take effect and put the cd in my discman, headphones on, and go for a walk through the paths in the woods. I am barefoot and the ground is mooshy from recent rain. I walk through this path for an hour or so, enjoying the beatiful hues of the forest. Smoke a few cigarettes along the way and walk back home. I watch some tv. Lay on my kitchen floor for most of the remainder of the trip enjoying the music and smoking some more cigs. 
123	After about 3-4 hours I start feeling agitated, restless, and slightly upset/depressed. I go to change the music and put on a Doors live album, Disc 1. I continue to grow gradually more unsettled and start seeing depressing imagery in all of the programs on tv. I try to call several people during the trip but nobody is home. The one person I managed to reach was going out at the moment so it was a quick call. I seem to have a strong need for other humanly contact, especially during trips. Which is quite odd as I'm usually very reclusive and isolate myself from other humans the majority of the time. I'm very uncomfortable in social situations and feel that I'm too dissimiliar from others to relate in a proper manner. No other substances were ingested during this time. I would like to try mushrooms again as I feel they could have more to offer and just that the set and setting were probably off, and perhaps it was just the wrong time.
124	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
125	About 1 o'clock in the afternoon. I slept in a little bit because our area was having a snow day, so everything was closed and shut down. My friend gave me a call and reminded me about our conversation from the previous night which was about eating some mushrooms. I had nothing to do so naturally I agreed and we began our search. We called almost every person we knew trying to find us some fungus and it was nowhere to be found. It was almost 5:30 by the time we found someone with enough for 6 people. At this point I was very frustrated because I had been searching for mushrooms all day and I was about to start tripping while in a bad mood. 6:30 roles around and the 6 of us have consumed our share, I ate just under an 1/8th at this sitting. I chewed mine up quite efficiently so the effects came to me within 20 minutes. The room started swaying in different ways and I was feeling great. We hung out for another 25 minutes or so then decided to take a trip outside.
126	[Now remember, we had a snowday because so much extra snow was on the ground, roughly a foot and a half] 
127	The air was chill and nature was calling my name.  We walked slowly in between a few ponds and that was one of my favorite parts of the night. The top layer was frozen so we began throwing rocks in to break the ice which was an incredible site to see at our point in time. Eventually we came upon a giant field where some kids had made a giant igloo. The 6 of us huddled in an enormous igloo as we came into our peaks. Smoking ciggarettes is another thing I learned about during this trip. We then ventured to what I like to call 'My World'. The rest of the field was covered in snow, but it had a lot of texture from people running all over it. 
128	[I should also mention that I love the color white when I trip]
129	The snow and all of its texture looked like a beautiful city in the clouds. It was nighttime and the city still shined bright. With this vision, I also saw myself as God which is something that happens when I trip. I felt this because I found out the greatness of this city, I could squash any of the buildings that I wanted. We all began squashing snow that looked like houses and buildings. It would have been funny to see 6 people walking around a field squashing snow at 8:00 at night. Anyway, we returned back to the room to come down off the trip, and for me stare at a blank white corner. So we were hanging out and one of the people's I was tripping with friend came in wasted and starting messing around with me starting me into a direction I didn't want to go in. It was starting to get late at night and I was ready to be done with  my trip. As I began feeling this, my visuals ended, but my mind was still stuck in the other world thinking about reality. I just assumed it was normal so I sat still and kept my mind off it. 
130	Twenty minutes or so go by and my mind is still racing. This got me very paranoid in my head. I thought that my brain was never going to stop thinking like it was and the constant ideas about reality would be stuck with me forever. I smoked some weed to calm me and see if it would help. It brought me back up a little and I had few more visuals and it tempted me to eat some more mushrooms, so 3 of us split a half eighth. That was just what I needed to bring my visuals back and then back down with my mind at the same time.

133	Yesterday at around 1 am I took about half a gram [0.6-0.8 grams] of Panaeolus (Copelandia) cyanenscens. The Effects took about an our to kick in. After a while I found myself lying on my couch giggling and repeating phrases that seem totally useless to me now like: 'I do what I do, and why..just for its own sake', 'There's no god, where should he be?' or 'Damn, I'm coming down' followed by endless laughter. I felt like I had solved all the mysteries of perception, mind and spirit and was perfectly happy. Now, I don't, but the most interesting thing about all this nonsense is that I could 'feel' the cerebral nature of my brain. You might ask 'cerebral nature', what's that supposed to mean? I'll try to explain: My conclusion was that that thing, located from behind my eyes down to my spinal cord and from there reaching into every part of my body, was actually myself. I was absolutely sure that the whole discussion about the nature and location of the mind or spirit is totally obsolete. 
134	Now I think it's not, because it's very intresting to listen to other people's opinion. What I mean is: I could watch 'myself' constructing the reality around me, instrumentalizing all the wonders of nature for its own ability to sit around, take some shrooms, smoke some weed and laugh its ass off, not knowing why or how. If you know Leary you got a glimpse of what I mean, it's the neuroelectric circuit, the awareness of constructing perception, damn cybernetic consciousness, man! I was able to imagine everything I wanted, like flowing through my bloodstream, finally coming out of one of the pores of my arm. Then, my skin was like the bark of a tree, protecting the inside, nothing more. When I finally came down I felt very exhausted (its hard to laugh for hours) and pissed off, since reality became what it was before. Now I feel gratitude for the wonders of the world but there is also sadness because of the cruelty and greed in human society. I'll never be able to understand how people can sell their soul for materialistic advantages. Wealth is a matter of perception and perception can be changed by most simple means.

137	Well, this happened a few months back in February or March.  Me and three other friends (Baz, Chris and Derek) decided to do shrooms one weekend.  I had done them about 6/7 times before, and was pleased with the high, but nothing could prepareme for what was about to happen.
138	We ate three grams of shrooms in Chris' room.  His room is the perfect setting for a psychedelic trip.  He has a black fury carpet, but his ceiling isnt finished (his room is in the basement).  From his ceiling he has old CD's hanging from string and has black, red, and green lights throubnout his room.  On his walls he has miniature pepsi signs painted on and a Molson Canadian logo which covers the whoe wall.  He also has a beer can plane hanging from his ceiling.
139	After twenty minutes of eating the shrooms I felt a little dizzy, so I lay down on his bed, then in about 10 min it hit me.  We started up with the usual gitty behavoir that a pre-shroom high always consists of.  Then, Chris played the 18 minute version of Dazed and Confused by Led Zepplin.  During the song the shrooms kicked in full gear and we were off ona psychedelic trip, by the end of the song we were all fucked beyond belief.
140	The colours in his room were reflecting off the CD's and into my eyes.  None of us could talk to each other because wehen we tried it sounded like endless echo coming from our mouths.  I put my head inside chris drawer and I felt like I was attached to it somehow.  Then I fell on the floor and went on for almost and hour about how 'nothing is always and the present is tomorrow'...just mindless ramble.  My friends had three mouths it looked like, and Baz was playing his guitar (we had just begun to learn so he wasnt taht good) but it sounded reqally cool.
141	It's too bad I waited this long to post this, becuase some of the cool stuff that happened I can't recall at this moment.  We ate the shrooms at like 9:00 pm and were high till about 3:00am, but only because we smoked a joint at around 1:30.  The experience was cool as well because it knocks down any insecurity I have and it lets me be myself completely.  All that aside, this was my only true psychedelic high, and I loved it sooo much that I want to try LSD ASAP.  So anyone who is thinking of doing shrooms, hang in there and take them a few more times, it took me 7 or 8 tries before it got really good.

143	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
144	This was the third time I've done psychedelics but I only ever take very low doses.  I was with friends and we had a great time at first, laughing loads.  Then we went to a club and I found that the environment was really affecting me - if the music was something I liked, I felt great, but if it was unfamiliar, I felt very confused and disjointed.  Likewise, seeing people who seemed different from me (dressed different, significantly older or younger etc) made me feel confused and like I didn't understand what was going on.  On my way home with my boyfriend, a car that had stopped for us at a pedestrian crossing suddenly revved and accelerated towards us for a 'joke', to scare us - this freaked me out big time and I was suddenly intensely scared.  My boyfriend kept asking what I was scared of, but it was nothing, or rather everything: just a sense of fear and vulnerability.  I desperately needed to feel safe, be in a familiar place with people I trusted, so I would recommend to anyone doing drugs like this that you do so.  Anything negative or threatening seems to be perceived more strongly, as if the normal defences that you have in your everyday life are stripped away.

146	Mushrooms - P. mexicana (193) : Personal Preparation (45), General (1), Various (28)
147	Lets get right to now - twelve hours after ingestion and no sign of relief.  I am only glad that I have sanity, a wonderful partner and two lovely children, because if any one were lacking I would be entirely lost now.  The most striking aspect of this trip is the total mundanity of it in terms of aural and visual perceptions.  Very normal.  However, my tactile senses seem very acute and are causing me anxiety at the moment.  I just want my nervous system to quieten down.  I'm confident it will in time - in the next twenty four hours I'm fairly certain.  And right at this instant I am resolving to take no more silly risks with myself for the sake of 'insight' or whatever other nonsense.  Imagine, just for a moment, that this is how I will have to face the world from now on...  Am I completely stupid?  I think we know the answer to that one.  Perhaps smart enough to avoid doing anything so stupid again.
148	What can I say to myself twelve hours ago to stop me doing it?  I am compelled to say something - I might stop you going this same way, getting here.  I should say this - I feel absolutely dreadful at the moment.  I may feel better in twenty four hours and I may not.  At this moment neither you nor I have any idea.  And that is not much fun.

153	My 1st encounter with psychedelia was not drug induced, it was lucid dream (i classify it in psychedelism because of its non-normal environnement). But, i did not knew how to define psychedelia until i took shrooms. I've done other drugs before, like weed, ether, alcool, xtc (MDMA isn't a psychedelic for me). I've done mushrooms a few times before this, but never feel any effects (as my other friends was feeling them).
154	Liège.Belgium.End of June. I'm 18. This was the end of my exam sessions and i planned on scoring some shroomz with some of my mates. So, after the exam, we went to Maastricht, Netherlands (which is near Liège, Belgium).
155	Because we bought several amounts of shrooms and were friendly, the nice merchant give us some additional mexican shrooms. We also bought some weed (White Widow as i remember, but i'm not sure).
156	When we came back in Liège, we changed our minds and decided to separate us (boys with boys and girls with girls). That evening i was sleeping at T's house, and his parents were out. We first smoke a big-sized joint, then we ate the dried shrooms (it was a 4 persons portion) plus some mexicans (cubensis, too, i think). They kicked quickly and i started to feel VERY light, and it began to grow in intensity, then i get really scared because i though i wasn't in reality and everything i lived in my life has been an illusion, so i really freaked out. T tried to calm me down but i didn't want to believe him because he wasn't real. After a while, i entered in a good trip and all really became fantastic. I think the quick mental-state modification was the real cause of that panic attack. 
157	I saw everything like if i was wearing some alien 3D glasses with a wide angle. Everything was living. I remember staring at the flame of a candle and it multiplied backward, and as i stared more and more precisely at the end of the 'copies', i realize that these copies, from a certain angle, was forming a kind of 'night street scene'...pretty weird...
158	I became also aware that the notion of time was obsolete. 
159	And, when i closed my eyes, i could see some dancing patterns, alterning or morphing with strange images. Music was essential, because it defined the color of the trip. I thought music was 'tasting' like sugar, but later after the trip i remember we ate shrooms with some sugar (due to the taste).
160	This was a very intense trip and a big one for a real 1st trip.
161	I also had weird conversations with T, for example, i looked at him and saw that something was wrong in his face and i said him something like 'i know what's happening to you, don't worry, all it's fine'. Or we talked about brain structure. I really liked the experience and i've done a couple of other ones, now; every experience is different and mind expanding/glowing. I had other bad trips but i think they are very useful in the understanding of ourselves. I've also tried LSD and i strangely never had any bad trips with it.

163	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : Difficult Experiences (5), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
164	After spending a day walking around on Dartmoor for a calculated 12 miles we ended up with a bag of liberty caps and a large carrier bag of fly agaric (about a kilo). The walk was most terrible but advised if you enjoy what I have to say.
165	Later on that day (at my house) the mushrooms were counted out and the fly agaric shared between us. we had 350 liberty caps in total and a fair few large fly agaric caps each. The Liberty caps were all brewed up, and my fly agaric cut up and drying on a few plates. 
166	We shared most of the brew out between the three of us (worked out to be 80 caps each) and drank, which tasted fine with a couple of tea bags and a lot of sugar. We didn't no how long it would take to start having effect but we started to feel quite different about ten minutes after we had drunk the brew, nothing intense at all but just a slight strangeness. My father then gave us a lift over to Ollie's house where we would spend our unconscious state.
167	The next set of events I am telling you to the best of my ability, I cannot remember what happened exactly but I will try my best to describe the nights proceedings.
168	We were all getting quite silly in the car, laughing a little but all trying to let the mushrooms take control of us and not just trying to play up on the fact that we were poisoned, all slightly worrying if we had taken enough and if we were going to be that out of it. Our paranoia soon came to end as soon as a foot was stepped out of the car. A slight breeze against our intoxicated cheeks, floating towards his front door as if we had just been dropped off on some weightless paradise. Colours so intense, even though it had been dark outside for a few hours. Walls of nearby houses were morphing between different shades of pink and purple, all of us in complete and utter harmony with each other and our surroundings. 
169	We knocked on his door but no one was in, so proceeded around the side to his back garden, as if we had just found the portal to the secret garden. The grass looking so plush and fantastic, changing from green to purple, the three of us talking to each other in amazement of what we were witnessing in front of us, totally loving the surroundings, all with a smile reaching from one ear to the other planted on our faces. Ollie came up through the back gate with a few more friends just coming back from scoring some ganja. We proceeded into his house and up to his room where the bongs started getting passed around.
170	Everyone else there had dropped pills, which did put the three of us on a strange level with them, but we put up with it anyway it was not too bad but if you are going to do mushrooms it is advised to be in a place where you are just with people that are intoxicated on the same mushrooms as well.
171	The real hallucinating started in his room after sitting in three rounds of large bongs. Just as weed enhances the hallucinations if you are on ecstacy, the same and even worse I think happens with mushrooms. Also I clearly remember Tim rolling bloody nice joint and wondering how the hell he could do that in his state. I was seeing geometrical patterns of different colours. The strange thing though was that these patterns were morphing from one thing into another depending on what environment I was in. The shapes would change size and position and colour. If I went outside the setting that before was euphoric now seemed dark and depressing, the shapes would morph into something that represented evil, due to the dark setting. A sort of Picasso cubist style, horned beast was in front of me, laughing the most terrible laugh ever, then that would change into lots of smaller ones in a lattice formation within my imagination, still constantly laughing. This shit was freaking me out and I was getting scared, I definitely had to get back inside.
172	Time seemed very distorted and what was 3 or so hours seemed to take a whole day to pass by. I had heard about people tripping on fly agaric for days, and still not coming out of it totally for years. I didn't know if this was true when I heard it but when I was on liberty caps, I honestly didn't think that after hallucinating so much I would ever come out of my state. This made me extremely petrified and I actually remember quoting to Tim and Pete 'I don't think I am ever gonna stop tripping' This was near the end of the night when things started to get dodgy and at one point found myself being sick down the toilet thinking I was going to die.
173	We decided to walk home after that I think due to the people around us and the ganja that we were smoking we all started to sketch out a little, and sure enough all of a sudden I was nearly completely back to normal having to suffer the hour long walk home, but knowing that the mushrooms I had taken and stimulated parts of my brain that I had never used before, a totally mind expanding experience. I cannot wait to feel the same again, this time knowing that it will come to an end, and probably a little less ganja for me I think. It's a long way to mushy season but I cannot wait.
174	A quick word about the fly agaric. When they were dry I ate them with another mate; Ben. We had about 10g between us and didn't feel a thing, still I'm very weary of there powers, and I dont think I'll take them again, just in case.

176	Mushrooms - P. semilanceata (90) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
177	I submitted a report before but I had not known the real power of the Wavy Cap until now. It all started on a rather boring day and my friend and I where going to purchase some shrooms off a fellow shroomer because we woke up that morning too late to really go. We sat around and smoked cigarettes for an hour or so and desided to go visit my friends brother for awhile. Once we got to my friends brothers house we all got to talking about how beautiful the spot is where all of our friends and us go to get Psilocybe cyanescens and how the cops are watching it now and so on and so forth when we desided fuck it. We where gonna go down to this magical spot and pick all we can. This spot is one of the most beautiful spots in the forest I have ever seem. The mushrooms grow every where. And it's wild how the shrooms change when we pick them and bruise all those cool shades of brown and blue on the gills. We loaded our pockets and where spooked out of the forest by other people who where probably narks and really weren't there for nothing but to ruin some ones life. 
178	So we hopped into the car and road our way back to OH. Now that we where back at my friends house (Lets just call him Dough-Nut) we threw all we picked into a kettle and made tea. Dough-nut let the water with the mushrooms in it simmer for a little while and strained it off into normal tea. We both drank the two glasses and drove back down to the Lake where I live. In 15 minutes we both started to feel the effects. (Like my brain is melting in my skull. And I always get this cold feeling.) Dough-nut and I walked across my uncles drive way where he parked into my uncles house becase we where hoping to get a joint from my cousin to mellow the mushroom buzz. We watch my cousin and one of his friends play playstation but I just couldn't handle being in the house at the time. So I told My cousin I was leaving and Told Dough-nut to come with me for a walk to my dock. As we started to walk I felt that giddy kind of energy. I started to talk about how I love how these things make me feel and how sometimes if I look at something I can only hear that thing and nothing else. 
179	And we both kept on walking until we got to our destination. As soon as I got to the dock it started to kick in hard. I was locked in to these trees which seemed to breath like in-hale and ex-hale and was bitching about my stomach. It ended up to be gas as I belched in releaf. We both grew bored rather quick and desided to go to my house again. This time I could feel the different emotions all wrapped up inside me and changing all the time. My vision became bright and beautiful and everything green seemed to glow. We both noticed the same type of this and we just kept going up the hill to my house. We walked back in to see my cusin and his friend toking a a big joint. I asked to hit it and so did Dough-nut and we started to laugh and say 'MAN AM I FRIEING' and 'God I am stoned'. Just ripped out of our minds. The Colors on my cousins wall seemed to move. And I watched them dance all alonge the room. I shook my head and went to the bathroom to try to pull myself together. And still I look to the wall and I see the flowers that are on the wallpaper crawl up and up to nothing. 
180	Wierd, I though and just went on my business. After taking a reall wild piss I told my friend Dough-nut to come smoke a cigarette with me in the living room and watch some Cartoons. We sat for a little while and went outside over and over. We where smoking outside and we hear things. Voices. And I still was having that what ever I looked at is all that was there sindrome. So we sat on the coach this time for awhile and started to really get sunk in the mood. My friend started to freak... 'I am hallucinating' 'HOLY SHIT I AM HALLUCINATING' And I tried to tell him to calm down but Bazame!!!!!!!!!! It was on. Dough-nut ran outside and stated to vomit. The sounds that came out of this man would make satan piss his pants. After that was all over his eyes just stared at me like a scared rabbit and I told him he was ok but his trip was going the wrong way and it is hard to help someone like that. 
181	He started to tell me how he missed his lost family members and I was still tripping myself noticing that the sky was chnging color and the clouds where comming in to ingulf us. I watched all the trees bend As I wanted them to and for some reason was saying things I didn't even think of. I think it helped him and helped me. After all the peaking was through and we started to gain back true knowledge again we vowed never to do it again. At least for a few years or so but I will tell you this. I found god and I do recommend Mushrooms to the spiritually lost. But do not abuse it's visions. It's not all fun and games when you are taking your good friend to the looney bin.

184	I recently finished my first magic mushroom cultivation experiment.  I kept a journal In Microsoft Word, so I'll just copy and paste it from there.
185	First hallucinogenic fungus experiment journal
186	Sept. 18    Inoculated 11 - ½ pint jars with two strains of psilocybe cubensis, Puerto Rican and Treasure coast.  ___ jars were Psilocybe Cubensis var. Puerto Rican and ___ were Psilocybe Cubensis var. Treasure Coast.  Originally I planned to have twelve jars but at the time of inoculation I realized one jar was very water logged and I assumed very fucked up.  I didnt use the jar, but I prepared fresh substrate.  I seem to have misjudged the size of the needle I would be using because the holes in the lids were to small and I had to force the needle into the lids, bad idea I know but I am confident enough in how sterile my surroundings are and with my work.  Also, in one jar while I was inoculating it, the needle became clogged, rather than pull it out and re penetrate the cake, I forced the plunger to go down and it slipped a little and injected 2.5cc of Puerto Rican spores into the cake.  Another cake, while injecting into the second inoculation site caused water to come out of the other hole.  I assume this cake is water logged and will not work but ill give it 10 days to show growth, if it doesnt, ill clean the jar make fresh substrate and inject it with the 4ccs of treasure coast I have left
187	Sept. 20   Injected the twelfth jar with Treasure Coast spores.  This inoculation went off without a problem.  This jar will grow Im sure of it.  Then I put it in the closet box with the rest.
188	Sept. 22   So far I have kept the temp measured inside the box at a max of 93.0 and a min. of 75.6.  Both are a little extreme but it happened through experimentation and will not happen again.  The 93 was especially dangerous I know but it only happened in the box for maybe 5 min. before it dropped.  I am working on the assumption that the air temperature in the box is slightly higher than the temperature inside the jars.  Therefore it maybe at the most got to 91 in the jars, worst case scenario.  The recommended temperature for these spores by the spore supply company during mycelia growth is 84-86 and 74-76 during fruiting.  I am going to keep the growing chambers at room temperature inside the closet which appears through a weeks observation inside the terrarium appears to be between 76-81.    I have determined how I am going to control the temperature in the growing box.  I will use a heating pad under like 3 or 4 towels with the box the jars originally came in containing the jars.  With this setup I can maintain a constant temp no high than 88 no lower than 83.  With this I should be able to get a perfect temperature drop on their birthday.  Also today I took the jars out of the box for the first time to check growth.  Only one jar showed any growth, a Puerto Rican jar.  It only showed growth at one inoculation site but the growth there was massive but then, reaching from the top to the bottom of the jar.  Something worries me about this jar, the mold appears to be a slight grey color and seems to be showing up unusually fast. 
189	Sept  23  Checked for signs of growth again today.  The jar that showed signs of growth the yesterday doesnt worry me anymore.  The mycelium is that trade mark brilliant bright white of the cubensis and is now becoming rather thick.  I think the reason it looked so grey yesterday was because of how thin the stuff was.  I now assume this was the jar the syringe plunger slipped on because of the incredibly fast growth.  I wish I had ordered more spore syringes so I could do that to all the jars.  After the first batch when I make my own syringes I will do this to all the jars.  This fast colonization has to be an all around plus.  This fast strong growth has to eliminate the potential for infection of the cake and it gets you shrooms faster.  The next batch I plan to do this to at least a majority of the jars.  Not to be overshadowed by this amazing discovery 6 more jars shows sign of growth but nothing that incredible just the usual spots of growth you see with just 5 days.  I now have 7  ½ pint jars beginning colonization.  All is as planned with bonuses.
190	Sept. 28  Checked for growth today.  I now have a total of ten jars with at least a little growth.  Only two Treasure Coast jars have yet to show signs of growth.  These two jars arent showing signs of contamination so Ill wait until day 15 to throw them out.  One jar however appears to be rather water logged, a leak during pressure cooking caused this I believe.  I am giving it more time because another jar that seemed water logged is showing growth.  The best jar could have its birthday maybe in 10 days and the best few all within 15.  All jars showing growth will be ready within 23 I would guess.  The cakes with a lot of growth have obviously shrunk in size on the sides where theres growth.  Temp has been constant between 81 and 88 since the last entry five days ago.  As far as I can tell, no jars are showing signs of contamination, it appears I could possibly have a successful first attempt at growing shrooms.
191	Oct. 1  I still have ten jars with growth.  There is still no sign of contamination in any of the jars.  By my inexperienced guess work, I would say that there are 4 jars that could be ready for the terrarium within 5-10 days.  All but one of the jars with growth has shrunk dramatically.   Ive decided in the last couple of days that it would be easy for me to expand this experiment from 12 jars to 48.  Ive made all necessary calculations and it will cost me an additional $149.88 to expand my operation by four fold.  Ive begun gathering the additional supplies and sent the order in for 10 syringes and to more spore prints so I dont have to wait for the first flush to start the new jars.  Two new strains will be added to the mix, Tasmanian and PES Hawaiian.  Both of these strains are supposed to be very fast colonizers as well as abundant fruiters.  The stated colonization time for the Tasmanian for ½ pint jars is 13 days.  I dont think Ill be able to get the jars colonized that fast, but it will be a little faster I hope.  Ive come to the conclusion that the strains I have now colonize better at higher air temps inside there box so I have begun trying to keep the temp between 84-88.  Everyday I become more and more proud of this experiment.  This is going to be a BIG success.  
192	Oct. 6  Five jars are just a couple of square inches from complete colonization.  My previous assumption that the cakes colonize at higher temperatures are wrong, they do much, much better in the 81-84 range.  They have been in this range for 3 days now.  Im positive Ill have a few jars in the fruiting chamber by Friday, the 11th.  Once I bought more jars in preparation for expansion, I replaced the two jars with new ones.  Apparently, something bad happened to the spores in the treasure coast syringe.  The two jars that didnt grow were treasure coast and the two new jars I made were also treasure coast, and they showed NO growth.  The two original jars, when I cleaned them, had no growth at all.  This leads me to believe that if the spores had not been fucked up, I would have had 100% success on my first attempt.  Not bad.  Still, no signs of contamination in any of the jars.  This is going to be a very successful experiment in Mycology. 
193	Oct 8  The new spores and syringes came today.  I made ten syringes from two spore prints.  I had 5 Tasmanian and 5 PES Hawaiian.  I inoculated twelve jars this evening as well, 6 Tasmanian and 6 PES Hawaiian.  These are both fast colonizers and should be ready for the terrarium in 14 days.  
194	Oct. 9  Due to the threat of apartment inspections by the maintenance crew, I was forced to find a way to conceal the shroom boxes.  I found a way of insulating them in blankets making them appear to be a pile of folded blankets in my closet.  Today, I got fed up with the slowed growth of the growing jars.  I know the slowed growth is caused by high CO2 levels in the jars.  I took a risk, I sterilized everything around the jars and the box itself and decided to open air holes in the jars.  I know Im risking contamination but Ive had 100% success, I have confidence.
195	Oct. 10  The risk of opening air holes paid off.  The best jars has ½ a square inch left and will be ready by morning, most definitely.  Also, the way I hid the boxes turned out to be the perfect amount of insulation.  To maintain a constant 83, I only need to heat the boxes once or twice a day.  Im drunk, celebrating my success, excuse my typing.
196	I waited until about 6 pm this evening to remove any cakes from their jars.  I decided that two were strong enough to make it on their own in the world.   Looking to dose on the 18, if Im lucky and I think I might be
197	Oct. 11  It was three cakes birthday today.  One of the cakes from yesterday, which was not fully colonized, now is.  They both have fuzzy white mycelium growing on the surface, in some places up to a half inch think.  I started the light on a timer today, two hours of indirect natural light from 6AM to 8AM everyday.  Then another hour of light in the evening, around 10 or 11.  The temp stays between 75 and 77, up to 81 when the light is on.  Im planning on birthing the majority of the remaining cakes tomorrow, three or four.  One of the cakes, I think Ill just throw it out, its only half colonized, I could start a new jar and finish before this one will.  I was surprised this one grew at all anyway, the substrate was fucked from the beginning.  Ill just extract whatever psilocybin may be in it and try to trip balls.  
198	Oct 12  I have my first contaminated jar.  One of the new Tasmanian jars had a green mold growing near the bottom.  I dont know what the fuck it is but it resembles the green mold you typically find on bread, but I have no real idea what it is.  I threw the jar out.  OF the other 11 second batch jars, 3 more Tasmanian are showing mycelial growth.  Excellent.  The Hawaiian I chose for its extremely fast growth, but t takes longer than average for growth to show.  Once it does, they take off, consuming ½ pints in under 13 days.  We shall see.  Im planning on birthing two more cakes today.  However, one of them, Im still debating on, I may wait until tomorrow, but Im definitely birthing one.  These fuckers, they need to stop growing so fast, I cant keep up celebrating birthdays.  Ive had three in three days, give me a break, my body cant process that much alcohol and weed.  Hehe. 
199	Oct 14  I forgot to write yesterday that I birthed the final cake of the original batch.   Theres not much else happening with the cake in the fruiting chambers, they are growing fuzz all over them, but thats about it.  Of the second batch, I have 10 more jars with growth, only one jar has yet to show growth, but Im sure its going to start soon.  Im starting a third batch of twelve jars today.
200	Oct. 15  The first six cakes to enter the terrariums all have little white beginnings of pin head all over them.  The first three cakes even have a few pin heads with dark red tip, some standing a ¼ off the top of the cake.  I touched one to turn it, with just two fingers as lightly as possibly, within minutes, there were dark blue finger prints on the cakes.  I will be dosing this weekend, either Saturday or Sunday night.  All of the remaining cakes from the second batch (11) are showing signs of growth with no contamination.  Things are going as planned and better.
201	Oct. 17  There are pin heads on all 7 cakes in terrariums.   The best two cakes have shrooms a ¼ inch in diameter and 1 ½ inches tall.  None of the pin heads have aborted yet, at least not that I can tell.  It seems that more and more pin heads are being produced along with the older pinheads.  They also appear to grow in clumps.  One of the cakes, on the top, its completely covered in primordia.  Fantastic.
202	Oct.  22  Picked the first open caps, 1 oz.  I ate those this morning.  My normal dose is one fresh ounce, and these had to be the strongest mushrooms I have ever had.  My recommendation to anyone just planning on growing one strain of Cubensis for personal use, I would get the Puerto Rican strain.  They are amazing.  
203	Oct. 23  Picked all of the first flush today.  I got 3 ½ ounces of mature mushrooms and 20 grams of pin heads/aborts off of the seven cake, plus the three times I dosed, coming out to a fresh weight of 5 1/3 oz on seven cakes. 
204	Oct. 24  The remaining three ounces have fully dried using the damp rid method to a nice 9.9 grams.  My roommate ate a dry half eighth this evening and they are kicking his ass nicely.  Like I said, get the Puerto Ricans.  Also, of the second batch of jars, 5 are now in terrariums, for a total of twelve fruiting cakes right now.  Im going to let this be the end of documentation, Im tired of writing and theres not much more that can be learned, Ill just be repeating the same things over.  I consider myself very successful and would recommend that anyone who like magic mushrooms to grow them.

206	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : Alone (16), Cultivation / Synthesis (31), General (1)
207	Well, I finally got my hands on some mushrooms and wowie zowie it was the most incredible experience in my life, to date.
208	They had been floating around for awhile with some of my hookups but they always seemed to slip through my fingers, until one night a friend invited me over to fry with him and a bunch of other people. There were eight total, six of us were going to fry. We'd worked it out so everybody would take an 1/8th of mushrooms ground up and placed in a small glass of chocolate milk. One of us wanted to eat them, so he did and the rest of us drank it. Went down fine, had no real trouble with gagging at all (but one thing I've learned from gag, but you still have to eat drugs, is that you can always do something the first time, but after that you gag).
209	First stage, body fry. Felt a little bit of discomfort in my stomach. Not an ache, not nausea just a little bit of discomfort, it was tolerable. Go downstairs to watch a movie and I'm already feeling something after about 15-20 minutes. Slight distoritions in perception kind of similar to 'visuals' when I'm way stoned, only, my mind seems more clear. We move up to my friend's room and we chill there. About 30 minutes after dosing probably, and I get hit with ecstasy. I was happy as all hell, laughing my brains out, enjoying looking at more or less anything. Things seem to stretch, colors are accented and move rapidly, some things bulge and the ceiling 'womps' up and down. Walking is possible, with some weaving. After the happiness passed everything was still slightly distorted and I thought after that, that I had perhaps peaked (ha!).
210	Well, starting to get bored up in single room, I decided to move out to the back yard where everyone had been slowly trickling. I was a little scared, to move downstairs in view of some supervisors perhaps that I might be weaving or something, but I made it out back alright. The backyard I was in was small, but it had a lot of very pleasant looking plants and the main thing, a large trampoline that could fit probably seven people comfortably. It is very dark out back, but my eyes in utter dilation made it so I could just barely make things out, the ideal environment for visuals. Utterly confuses your brain, it doesn't know what anything is, so it makes everything look like something it's not, it's beautiful. My friend placed his hand on a magazine and told me to stare, it decomposed before my eyes. 
211	Now, it's time to hit the piece. Suck, suck, suck, taking huge hits was no problem and I had to conciously make sure I blew the hit out at some point, I felt like I could have held it in forever.
212	It's probably been about an hour and a half now and I just took a hit off a pipe and I get cottonmouth like nothing else, I decide to move inside and grab a drink but a supervisor was right inside so I decided against it and start to move back to the trampoline, click, the door behind me reveals the supervisor. That's it, the jig is up we're done for. Talking ensues, a conversation I remember well, but what was actually said, I'm not sure of. Jargon, I know the word sniffer was used so I don't believe any of it. It seemed to last an eternity, me standing there two feet away, conciously becoming aware I'm slowly inching away. It took a lot of effort to stand and stay quiet and not laugh shrooming.
213	Eventually, and mercifully, it left us and we all burst into laughter untold since we knew we were rid of it for the night.
214	Now, it's time to start passing the bong around. Finally, it's my turn I take a huge hit, which I could not feel in the slightest, and after nearly ghosting it I spewed what little was left and my brain began to melt. Twenty seconds after my hit I was enveloped in colors, patterns, shapes, objects, designs, all melting in and out of everything, everyone, all objects had rainbow hues dancing over patterns which melted and danced in unison over my vision. I was seeing it all. I closed my eyes, it served no purpose, I saw the same thing I saw with my eyes open, indescribable colors and patterns. I saw a red liquid dumped over my vision and it started to drain inward towards the center on a background of green glowing stars which then also started to drain towards the center. I remember having the thought that the shrooms changed and warped the world, and smoking added color and texture to those distorions, it was incredible.
215	Hit after hit, I would lay back on the trampoline and stare into the sky, which was purple and my eyes (so dilated) could see every star and any and all interactions in the sky. The trees in his backyard were incredible, I layed back, looked up and through the small spaces between the leaves I began to have hallucinations of color and pattern for incredible length. I could look into some of the plants and see acient rituals, or people dancing, always in vivid rainbow colors. I lost track of the voice inside my head and my true voice, at most points I didn't know whether I was talking or thinking. And I became aware that at some points I was whispering some pretty nonsensial things. It was truly the most wonderful and entertaining experience I've ever had.
216	Everyone, now wallowing in their own deep state of frying were milling about, inside and out all doing different things, but there were always at least 3-4 people out back smoking. I guess someone had ventured inside and busted out a black light on a pool table. It was incredible, colors were so vibrant and distorted none of the pool balls could remotley have been the colors they truly were. The red solid ball was neon orange. Then, one of the fellows begins to dance with the black light. It trailed, oh boy did it trail. It was beautiful to watch the dark purple light interact with the environment around. Throughout it all the theme was almost always of happiness, laughter and uncontrolled giggling were the name of the game. The whole thing was very much like an incredibly vibrant dream, but one that I could remember.
217	At a few points I had to venture inside to use the restroom. Mirrors were awfully intersting to look at. At some point, every person who fried ventured into the bathroom once and got lost in the mirror. The actual process of going to the bathroom was also interesting. As soon as the flow started immediate bubbling up of the ground and boiling of vision was intense. Add this to the fact I was in a bright bathroom after I'd been sitting in a pitch black environment for two hours with saucer eyes, and everything was absolutley shimmering gold and silver and bubbling and boiling all over the place. A gaze into the mirror and you were locked looking at yourself, while everything around you respectivley did their own crazy thing, thoughts would flood your mind. Beautiful ones, almost always good and happy.
218	The only time I ever got scared during the whole fry were the few times I had to venture inside to use the restroom, even then it wasn't like I was wallowing in terror, it was just the usual uneasiness that you would experience walking down a dark hall or something, no biggy.
219	I was absolutley frying and having full hallucinations for a good 4-5 hours, before I finally fell asleep. I'm sure I could have milked it for a few more hours and then a come down, but I settled for sleep. I was coming up on 24 hours without sleep, and I'd worked 12 of them outside doing labor. I was tired when I dosed, but the mushrooms pepped me up and kept me going for the ride. I didn't even really feel the need to sleep, it just felt so nice and warm on the couch and I could see all I needed to with my eyes closed, I eventually just drifted off.
220	Truly, though, it gave me a much greater understanding and appreciation of how it could be used on a spiritual level. I knew that night I had reached something I would never touch again, at least not for some time, it was a different level, a different plane of existence and I understand now why so many cultures pursued spirituality through the use of natural psychoactives (mushrooms, peyote, etc.) It was so clean and pure, I could feel that it was natural, it was from a living organism, not a chemical. It was beyond any high I'd ever experienced, psychadelics truly are a different class of drug from anything else. After seeing the most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life, I can understand that now. 
221	By far it was the most incredible and exhilarating experience I've ever had in my life. It saddens me I will probably never achieve such an experience from mushrooms again, as it was my first time, even, with true psychadelics at all. But for that one brief shining moment, I knew that this was truly a little taste of heaven.

224	This was my second experience taking shrooms. The first time they either were bogus, or I didn't eat enough.  This second time, I took two doses worth. I had priorly only done marijuana at this time.
225	While ingesting them, I usually just try to swallow them as quickly as possible with as little chewing and tasting as possible as they aren't particuarly tasty.
226	The onset took a little over an hour, and I had almost thought that I had gotten another bogus batch again, but I started noticing a change in my perception.
227	At first it was pretty mild and I was still able to be pretty coherant, but I was starting to experience a lot of visual hallucinations, but I was physically aware it was all an illusion brought on by the shrooms, so I was cool with it.
228	I went to the bathroom to talk to a girl I was going out with at the time and was watching myself in the mirror, watching the skin on my face form boils and my face getting all gargoyle-like and evil looking. I found this intruiging and tripped out in the mirror for quite some time.
229	I than sat chatting with my brother on his bed describing the visual effects being produced by the shrooms. The first noticable effect was walls and surfaces being wavy and/or turning liquidy. 
230	For example, his closet had that fake magoheny wood trim which was very wavy and it seemed to melt and glob into it's self, much like a lava lamp.  
231	I then stared at him for a short while, still describing the visual effects as I watched his face get all chunky and then cave in on it's self. I found it extremely cool because it looked so real even though I knew it was just a visual hallucination. I had to keep reminding myself it wasn't real. 
232	After a while I looked at a fake rubber cockroach he kept on his mirror and it appeared to come alive and move around. I also looked at one of those little square paint blobs you make at local fairs, and the black dried paint began to run and move to the edges.
233	About this time my brother kicked my tripping ass out of his room since he had to work so I lay in the hallway for what seemed like two hours tripping on the walls and the ceiling and laughing to myself because they were all wavy and pulsating and appeared to come closer to me.  I was able to somehow soom into the ceiling and see the smallest particles.
234	I finally made it out to the living room where I realized the television was on and I tried to watch it, but my mind could not put the visual and audio together. My hearing would make the sound slow down out of sync with the picture on the TV or go really fast.  
235	There were times when I would hear a sound with my whole body and my whole body would just do one big twitch. By this time it had been about three or four hours and it was probably around 2 in the morning and I was getting tired.
236	I began tripping on my hand a bit, holding it out, and watching it turn to a rubber-like texture, and then looking at a plaque with a religious inscription my deceased grandmother had given my brother. The plaque started glowing and I saw weird characters burn into the plaque, like old arabic or hebrew or something.  I felt my grandmother was trying to contact me from the grave and it was a very rewarding and spiritual experience.
237	I finally tried to go to my room and go to sleep, but I realized the heater vent sounded as loud as a 747 jet, even though in reality it wasn't, it was just my distorted hearing.
238	I continually tried closing my eyes for about an hour, only to have the sensation of thousands of thoughts, images, and feelings pulse through my brain, almost like an information overload and wishing it would stop so I could go to sleep. It was more annoying than anything else since it wouldn't have bothered me so much had I not been so exhausted.
239	I finally was able to succumb to sleep and awoke the next morning, very tired, but pretty much returned to normal. Sadly, I had to work a 10 hour shift at work that day and I dragged ass, but it was definately worth the experience. Next time I would take the day after the trip off though to recuperate from the mental and physical drain it does on the body

241	Mushrooms (39) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
242	"	It can be said, that when the universe converges all possibilities to a single night of magnificence, that all those present will be affected in different and profound ways.  For me and many of my friends, this occurrence took place in the last summer of the old millennium, on a warm July night at wreck beach.  "
243	"	We had all come here on previous nights in the summer, and discovered that it was a very reliable and safe place to purchase psychedelic, and other such drugs.  Being that it was a clear night, and with nothing else to do, me and several other friends decided to head down to the beach to see what was happening.  "
244	"	Upon arrival, we all purchased a few grams of northern lights, which is an exceptionally good strain of Mary Jane.  After sharing this herb with each other and few travelling musicians from Arizona, I decided that tonight I wanted to have my second experience with the magic mushrooms.  This was also the case for a few others in the group, and we departed the circle in order to scan the beach for a suitable dealer.  We ended up buying from a large African man with several earrings, who offered to sell them at a buy three grams  get one free rate, at five dollars a gram.  This being a very good deal, we all agreed, and I purchased three grams.  This would normally be more than enough for a dose, but because I got an extra gram for free I decided to go for it all and eat four."
245	"	Returning to the now crackling campfire where the rest of my friends were, I listened to the mellow rhythms of the drums and smoked another bowl as I anticipated the excitement of the night to come.  As the sun began its beautiful sunset in the distance, I felt the first real effects of the mushrooms.  I remarked to my friends that I was feeling a little bit surreal and someone replied that in half an hour I would be very high.  "
246	"	I started to get scared that I had perhaps eaten to many shrooms, and that I might freak out and have a bad trip, but I grounded myself and remained calm.  Then, just as the sun slipped behind the horizon, a lightning storm in the distance erupted into a frenzy of glory.  Lightning came crashing down into the ocean over by Delta.  This is so crazy! I remarked as we began to walk towards a log that was pointing out into the ocean.  We all walked along the log to the end and we were surrounded by water on both sides, and when I stepped onto the water, expecting to pull a Jesus and surprise everyone, I found myself knee deep in the ocean.  "
247	"	That is when things really started to get fun.  I could feel myself merging with the ocean, and could feel myself as I washed onto the beaches of Japan in endless waves.  Just then, the lightning flashed, and brought me back to where I was, and I felt like I could feel an electrical charge go through me when the lightning hit the water.  Thinking that perhaps this was not such a good idea to stand there, I started walking back to the growing campfire where I could hear drums and singing and guitar.  It took my by then tripped out friends and I quite a while to get back, as we had to maneuver around the many large sand snakes, which I realize no to be logs.  "
248	"	When we got back to the campfire, I noticed there were many people there, all of different races and backgrounds, who all got along on the common basis of love for music, campfires, sunsets, entheogens, and lightning.  The music started to take on a life of its own and wrap me around it and show me the forgotten corners of my mind.  I have never felt such a pure connection to everything that is, and time and space and myself disappeared and all that was left was what I can only assume to be what we call God.  This was the peak of my experience and I have drawn inspiration from it to this very day.  Remembering that moment is what gets me through a lot of though days.  "
249	"	Well, after many hours of extreme fun and excitement and an incident involving a talking Bengal tiger made of galaxies, the visual effects began to diminish, and the sun began to rise.  We all gathered again, climbed the stairs back to the city, and took the long bus ride home to normal reality.  This was by far one of the best nights of my life and something that has changed my awareness significantly for the better.  If that is illegal than arrest me, but Ill never forget that experience."

251	Mushrooms (39) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Nature / Outdoors (23), General (1)
252	Night before New Years eve, and me and 5 friends decide to go for a nice trip.
253	We all dropped at our friends house at about 10pm, in the middle of a party. We all dropped somewhere between 1g and 1.5g of dried mushrooms. I didn't notice anything happening by 10:30, so me and a friend decided to do everything that was left. I'm not exactly sure how much it was, but it was about the same as what I had taken at 10. By 11pm I was starting to feel the initial effects, mostly just an unexplainable feeling that something 'big' was about to happen. Like the feeling I get outside just before a huge storm. Everyone else left for a bar at about this time, leaving me and my 5 friends alone.
254	In the next hour my storm broke. I should mention that this was only my second time trying any drug other than pot, and it was at least 2x the shrooms that I did the first time I tried them.
255	By 12am I was well and truely tripping. It was far beyond anything I experienced my first time, nearly 9 months earlier. We (everyone on shrooms) were all sitting in a circle in my friend's living room, talking and sharing what was happening to each of us. I didn't share too much, as I was barely conscious at times. I remember listening to my friends talk about trees, colors, dogs. I kept laughing, and each time I started laughing I would stop to find myself laying on the floor with my friends lauging at me. I decided to go hide in the corner, beside a little tree that looked peaceful to me.
256	I can't say what time it was, as I had lost all concept of it by now, but eventually we all decided to go downstairs and listen to a CD my friend had brought with some trippy music on it. We went downstairs, but most of the guys couldn't stop talking or laughing, so they abandoned the music and went up stairs. I was the last person in the room, and I remember trying to walk towards the stairs but I kept forgetting why it was I wanted to go to them. So I just stood there with my head back and my eyes closed.
257	While I stood there, I began to notice the clouds and blobs I could see with my eyes closed begin to take on definate shapes. Colorful and intricate fractals started to appear and 'dance' to the music. I was amazed at the power of my mind to create these things that my computer struggled to produce. I watched with awe as the fractals moved and zoomed in to reveal new and wonderful shapes. I couldn't control what I was seeing, but that didn't bother me at all. About this time a few of the guys came downstairs and found me laying on the floor with my eyes closed (note that I don't actually remember how I got there). They tried to bring me upstairs, and I tried to tell them to just leave me. I couldn't talk. One or two words would come out and suddenly the sentence would change and another one or two words of a different thought would come out. I remember KNOWING that it was because I was only partially in this world and this reality. Eventually the guys just decided to leave me down there, with the music.
258	With my eyes closed and the fractals dancing to the music, I hit what I can only describe as the peak of the experience. Suddenly the music faded away almost to infinity, until I could only barely hear it. The fractals dissapeared from my view and I was floating in an empty void. Remembering back on it, I couldn't even feel my body. I couldn't remember life, being alive, or the concept of existence. I just WAS. Presently I understood that the blackness I was 'seeing' was an empty sky. I waited for what seemed an eternity as blue and red 'stars' appeared in the blackness to keep me company. The sky filled with these stars and a blue cloudy mist that looked much like the Milky Way on a dark summer night. In an instant I could feel myself again, but not where I once remembered being. I was laying on a bed of soft grass. My arms were spread out to each side of me. Above, and around me, statues appeared. They looked like the kind of statues you would see in a church, with serene faces and hands against their chests in prayer. They were all positioned around me in a circle, and seemed to be looking down at me. Suddenly the stars in the sky exploded in showers of red and blue dots, much like fireworks do. As the exploding stars faded from existence, so did the rest of the world. I was, for the moment, back in reality staring at my friends basement ceiling.
259	I started to get a little depressed about losing the vision I had just been treated to, so I decided to go upstairs. Everyone was watching TV, so I just layed down in front of the TV and tried to enjoy the rest of the night. I didn't have any more visions, but I kept slipping in and out of reality. I remember gasping for breath for no other reason than being able to.
260	The rest of the night, and my trip, was extremely enjoyable. I woke up the next morning feeling great (despite sleeping on the floor) and can honestly say the experience has changed my life for the better.

269	Mushrooms (39) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Nature / Outdoors (23), General (1)
270	The other day i did shrooms for my second time, but in all truth it completely blew away the first time. It started out when my friend gave me a gram of shrooms (really good ones) right before 1st period, and said to just take them. I had a short mental debate over whether or not I should take them, and then just did it. I hadn't had any breakfast, so the effects started to set in pretty quickly. By +30min I was already fully into the coming up stage. Time seemed to drag on forever, and minutes seemed like hours. I was so messed. the projection that my teacher was showing us started to warp and bend, and peoples faces were stretching and starting to melt a little. The time kept dragging horribly and I started to wonder 'what have I done to myself?'. I thought I was gonna die, and since the room was dark, my visuals were pretty heavy and I almost freaked out once or twice. By the time 1st period was ending I was done coming up and was full on trippin'. I wasn't prepared for what was coming next.
271	After a long walk throught the halls, I got to the locker room and dressed out for PE, and went to the gym. I talked excitedly to people for a while (that reminds me, my jaw was tightly clenched and aching). I sat down and let the teacher take role, enjoying my trip. Then we started by doing some calestenics, and moved on to an activity called form running. This i where it became interesting. We started running in different styles and the sound of peoples footsteps and voices and weird noises and even their actions became a sort of inexplicably beautiful music, so beautiful I became completely enthralled with it, obsessed with it. We went through form running, and started playing dodgeball (my friend had to help guide me through it). I became increasingly interested with my closed eye visuals (it was too brite in there for strong open eyed visuals, beside extreme warping in the bleachers and the wood floor, and seeing people threefold.).
272	I saw something like a shoe-print crossed with a dollar sign and made up of little metallic orbs and colorful liquid. However, my most memorable vision was of two, two-dimensinal, aztec-like heads made of a brown kind of stone. they were built into a seemingly endless wall. The two faces were conjoined, in the way that one's mouth formed the other one's brow. I can still see this image in my head, but I can't quite describe it, the way they were conjoined, it bent space in a way. The rest of the day was pretty typical after gym, besides the fact that I couldn't concentrate very well. It was a great learning experience, and I plan to repeat it within the week. Thanks for listening to me babble on.

274	I have been utilizing shrooms for ritual purposes for sometime now and had, until recently avoided smoking them due to the numerous writings and rants from others that consuming them in that manner was a waste at best.  My chosen method of ingestion is usually the tea variety since it's easier to manage on my stomach and also to incorporate into the ritual itself.  recently, after reading much a.o.spare writings and also revisiting a wonderful book 'Plants of the Gods' (highly recomended if your interested in the cultural/spiritual use of the flora around us) and I had decided that I would finally break down and try the smoking method.  
275	After smoking nearly an 1/8th of shrooms before the ritual work I had planned (tasted remeniscent of dmt in enjoyment) I experience a feeling of elation, but not much else.  So, for all of you out there considering smoking this wonderfully useful and benifical plant, I would stick to a oral method, the effects are more benefical from my view and also more worth the money involved in aquiring them.

277	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : General (1), Alone (16)
278	Ive ingested 4 times this week,at 3-5 grams/session, and have gone 2 days with NO other drugs. i was intrested in the idea of smoking mushrooms but with rumors abound i figured i would read about it first. after an hour it sounded ok to me so, i ground some small dried caps at about 1-2 grams, stuffed it in the bowl of my bong and off i went at 2:50pm and smoked it all within 2 minutes.  the onset was mild and nothing like ingestion but by 3:10 pm i decided to write this summary of the experience. 
279	Motivational?...Im not sure, but it's nice and not too overwhelming. Overall i would say there is something there but don't look forward to the same effects as ingestion!

281	Mushrooms (39) : First Times (2), General (1), Unknown Context (20)
282	I was at one of my best friend's houses and his parents were gone for the weekend.  It was the first time we had decided to do shrooms during the day.  What a fantastic idea.
283	Anyway, my friend and I had just shy of an eighth each.  We munched 'em down and chilled, as the typical body buzz began to creep.  About 20 minutes into the trip, I started to get intense visuals which mostly consisted of melting.  This was the first time that I had gotten melting visuals, so I stared at all the wonderful oddities in my friend's house in pure awe and amazement.  After about an hour of colors shooting out of paintings, wrinkles in leather couches undulating, and mounted fish coming alive, I began to hit my peak.
284	At this point, things were getting so intense, I couldn't even get a hold of myself.  Every time I looked at anyone, or my own hands and arms, the normal skin seemed to be covered with a strange membrane (kind of like a baby mouse type skin).  I could barely keep my eyes open the entire time, for everything was completely out of whack, and I couldn't make the visuals cease.  They just kept getting stronger and stronger.  My friend's kitchen floor is made up of concentric octagonal tiles and as I walked through the kitchen, each tile would be of a different height as they shot up from the ground like pillars.  I laid down back in the TV room on the carpet, with the side of my face on the ground and watched the fingers of the carpet grow as they waved like the stalks in a wheat field.  Slowly, a white smoke, like that from dry ice, floated over the carpet enveloping everything, including me.  It was kind of hard to handle such an intense feeling of...I don't even know, maybe falling too far into a trip, so I went outside.
285	It was the most beautiful day.  The sky was clear with scattered lines of clouds.  I sat in a lawn chair mesmerized by the foliage and sky as I drifted into a visually tantalizing trance.  My friend called my name and as I looked at him, his face had small silver BBs in each corner (the tear glands of his eyes, corners of his mouth, around his nostrils, etc.)  Soon enough, his entire head was made completely of sliver, shiny BBs, and I basically sat there speechless, not knowing what the hell was going on.
286	The rest of the day was awesome.  I didn't explain much of my experience of being outside, but I most urgently suggest that y'all try shroomin' during a nice, warm day in the summer.  Boomin' at night and during the day seem to me as two totally different things.  Anyway, nice boomin', keep it real, peaceout.

289	My first (but not last) experience with shrooms:
290	At my parents farm (northern louisiana), I and my friend were set to go fishing for the day.  After opening the gate, I drove my Runner through while he closed.  Driving down the path, my friend - let's call him Trip - said, in a muffled, excited voice, 'Oh my God!  Look at the shrooms!'.  Nothing new to me, they've been there since I was a boy.  Little did I know how these would add such a change to my life perspective.
291	After convincing me they were harmless and I would love them, we picked a huge amount (like half a glad trash bag) and headed to his house.  Trip went to the kitchen, boiled some water, put about 12  shrooms in and after 4 min's, took them out, added Kool Aid, and served me my first dose of new reality.  He told me it would take about 30 min's to set in and we left for the movies.
292	Having bought the tickets on the way in - I was nervous about seeing people from the hospital - I was totally relaxed.  
293	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
294	First, let me expalin I have no ordinary Runner.  It's a 99' Limited 4WD, rims, tires, rack, grille, nurfs, etc. - and a stereo that you would kill for (Boston Acoustic, Alpine and Sound Stream). Ok. . .we got in and loaded The Crystal Method.  Driving down what was once a familiar highway, after about 13 min's, I didn't know where I really was.  I mean, I knew the vicinity, I knew my truck and Trip, but I couldn't remember how to get to the fucking movies.  My skin initially vibed and a twinge started at the base of my skull, radiated outward down my limbs and ended with a plastered smile across my face.  I pulled over into Wal-Mart's parking lot to gain my bearings and park my truck.  I looked over at Max, saw this devilish grin on his face and ended up laughing for about 20 min's - and uncontrolable laugh that had my stomach in cramps and tears streaming from my eyes.  I knew this was going to be a great night.
295	We ditched the tickets and headed to my parents house boat.  I know, trust me, that you're wondering how I kept my bearings - it just felt natural but I also understand it wouldn't have been an excuse if I killed someone while driving on this, sorry.  Anyhoo, we parked the boat in a wooded cove, let down the ski and cranked Crystal again.  The moon was full, the water black as tar and the air perfect.  I thought I was Jesus for a while, floating in the water, secured to about 8 lifevests.  We drank a few beers, laughed like never before and music took on a new definition for me.  The night lasted about 13 hours and never did I have a 'bad' or scary time.  It was simply incredible.
296	Like I said, initially it took me by surprise how fast it hit me, how strong the effects were and the unfamiliarity of my new mindset.  But, after about 5 min's, I was ok with everything.  But, I must say, I am a headstrong person and live for danger and new experiences.  Driving on shrooms??? Hmmm. . .for me, it was awesome.  Was I in as much control as I felt I was in? Trip, tripping like I was, was no gauge for my driving tactics - but the Trooper on side of us for about 3 miles was - seemed to be fine, but I haven't done it since. 
297	The colors of life, the sky, the way the music sounded - '...this message is coming to you. . .', I thought it was coming to ME.  My sense seemed to be heightened about 1000 times normal and everything had a slant of humor or happiness.  The boat. . Wow!!!  The sky, moon, air and water were all equally as warm to my senses as my own heart. As in the truck, everything seemed to be a new environment, a new place that I was very comfortable in/with, but experiencing for the first time.
298	What can I say about shrooms??? I love them, do them frequently.  Like the Matrix, everything you knew before seems to be unreal. . .of a different world and the one I am in after ingesting shrooms will be much more loving. 
299	p.s. i've also been 175mph on my 900RR, sky diving and mountain biking while on shrooms, but that's another story.

302	I had just been fired from my job, and I was not in a very great mood.  I knew that my friend had more shrooms than he knew what to do with, so I made a call and got 2 grams of dried mushrooms for 20 bucks.
303	When I got them, I noticed that there was a lot more stem in the bag than the last time I bought them from the same guy.  I'm not sure how much this really changes the effects of the drug, but I certainly was NOT in for a surprise.
304	About 1.5 hours after eating them, the only effects I got were the occasional laugh out of the blue, but that was it.  There was literally NO auras around lights or anything that describes as a medium dose, which I assumed I had taken.
305	I have brought from this guy before, and his stuff is always good, we have been friends for a while, so I know he wouldn't cheat me, but this certainly was not worth the 20.  It felt like I had taken a few hits from some decent weed, that's it.  My pupils were dilated almost to the edge, but there were no other physical signs.
306	It might be worth noting that I had eaten a breakfast sandwich from my work, dunkin donuts, a few hours before, but certainly nothing significant.  Overall, I think I may need to take over double this dose next time to get any significant effects.

308	Me and a friend of mine Dan came into a large amount of mushrooms and got tired of eating them, so we ended our trip and the next day tried smoking them. At first smoking mushrooms may taste bad, but its an aquired taste, after about 3-5 hits I dont really taste how bad it is anymore (not that its that bad anyways, it smells worse then it tastes).
309	We also found out that the lucky number for us was 3 bowls, after the 3rd one I felt a strange feeling, not like a high on pot, its closer to a hash high, but its still kinda of different, such as in my case I saw a radio tower with blinking lights, and when the light would blink it sent out rays in every direction of red light. Then I went and looked at the stars, and they seemed brighter and more real then usual, there was also a sort of pale redish green/blue halo around the sky and some of the brighter stars.
310	All and all the experience was similar to eating mushrooms, but it was still different in its own way, it is definetly something I would do again, but it is not as 'trippy' an experience as eating mushrooms.

313	At 2:15pm, I ingested 2 grams of very strong magic mushrooms. I was sitting on a hot, crowded beach in Atlantic City, NJ. I went into the ocean to cool off a couple of times and then went up to the boardwalk to buy cheese fries. While I was eating, I started to feel very relaxed. I couldn't finish the fries. 
314	The sand looked like it was starting to move. Eventually, the people on the beach started to look like cardboard cutouts. I dared to go in the ocean again. When I was standing in the ocean, the water looked like it was stretching and I felt very disoriented. I walked back to my towel and laid down, but I didn't feel relieved. 
315	It was so hot and I felt like I was suffocating. All I wanted to do was go home. I left the beach at 4pm and looked for someplace that might have air conditioning to go into. After more disorientation, I ended up in the Bally's casino. The sounds and lights from the slot machines were too much to bear, so I went back onto the boardwalk. I continued to walk for what felt like forever, and the casino buildings looked bigger than life. I found an outdoor shower and showered the sand off of myself. 
316	After walking down onto the street, I continued walking until I reached a Ruby Tuesday's. It seemed like it took them forever to bring water to the table. I thought it would feel cooler in the restaurant, but I still felt warm. I knew if I left the restaurant it would feel ten times hotter outside, but all I could think about was bolting out of there and getting to Atlantic Avenue to catch the 507 bus that would take me home. 
317	After bolting, I sat on a corner bench for a very long time, but I couldn't focus enough to read the bus schedule, so I just sat there forever. Finally, I got up and started to walk south. Everything I was seeing was shaky. Every time I tried to relax, things became more distorted, pixelated. When I strained to concentrate, I could only focus for a moment. 
318	It seemed like a miracle when the 507 finally pulled up to the curb. Once the bus was on its way, I looked out the window at the marsh, the pine trees. The marsh looked like it was moving, just like the sand was. The trees looked like cardboard cutouts. I felt like I could see passing buildings before actually passing them, kind of like stop motion. When I looked at my hands, they looked distorted, like a pixelated image. 
319	I began to fear that my mind might stay stuck in the trip or that I might need to be committed and given Haldol (an antipsychotic drug) to come out of it. The bus passed by my grandparents' old house, which looked like a cardboard cutout. Soon, the bus reached my stop. 
320	I was still disoriented when I walked the block and a half to my house. I got inside to find my brother visiting. No one seemed to notice anything was wrong with me. No one seemed to notice anything was wrong with me. I was mostly worried about my mother. The dogs seemed to be looking at me funny, but I was really happy to see them. I went upstairs, took 30mg Ambien and 200mg of Seroquel to help me pass out. I wanted to go to sleep, wake up, and for everything to look normal again. 
321	I jumped in the shower, but my vision was so distorted I thought I kept seeing dirt on me. I tried not to let that deceive me. The fabric on the wet, blue rag kept moving around like stop motion worms. I got out, got dressed, and went downstairs. Things were continuing to look pixelated, but I got myself a bowl of fruit and sat down with my mom and my brother. When I looked at the dogs, it looked like their fur was moving around. I ate an entire box of candy cakes and went up to bed. 
322	I slept for 16 hours and woke up completely normal, just very groggy.

325	I started out by planning out my day. Just like most journeys to the unknown. I strongly felt the urge to ingest the mushrooms around 3 o'clock, so I could witness the fall of the sun around six. About an hour before the trip I decided to take an hour long weed nap, I didn't want to have a weed high during my trip. I like just feeling the all out effects of the mushroom. I didn't want to have a weed high during my trip. I like just feeling the all out effects of the mushroom. 
326	I awoke from my nap, and had an incredible urge to ingest the mushrooms, I took out the 1/4 and started to pray with the mushrooms, this gave me the strength to not question the power of the mushroom. I slowly ate the fungus and swallowed it down with some apple juice, for the vitamin c and to help the bitter taste of the stems, the caps had no bitter taste at all. I didn't want to wait for the onset so I put my body under my blanket and listened to some music. 
327	As my body started to tingle and my ego started to fade I saw my vision start to blur and I started to hear a loud buzz or hum. I slowly took the blanket off my head and saw fantastic colors all around the room. As the shrooms intensified I found myself slowly falling off the bed, once on the floor my ego was dead. I was stuck looking at some sort of force. Way too difficult to see and and too intence to find out what is was. I belive it was my spirit of some sort. My mind started to boggle at this time, I had really bad retrospectives on my personality.
328	I found out later in the trip I was just starting to live. 
329	'Have I been dead all these years, just now alive for the first time' I thought. As the trip started to fade I realized I needed to just be myself, educate my mind to the fullest I thought, get involved in the world. 
330	In this trip I found out its a terrible thing to make the body control the mind, let the mind flow and just take me wherever I go, people like a person that have a beautiful mind. This was far the best trip I have had.

333	The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
334	Last year, I was an exchange student to Japan.  It was a life changing experience in many ways.  One of the best things about Japan is that the Magic Mushrooms are legal.  You can go to a head shop and pick and chose from dozens of sacks.  Me and my friend who was also an exchange student had eaten the mushrooms every weekend for the past 4 weeks.  However, we had not eaten cubensis for about 2 months.  
335	We went to my freind's house since there was a park nearby and we wanted to go to the park.  We packed some music and a blanket.  We took St. John's Wart since we had recently read an article about MAOI's.  We each took a very heavy dosage and washed it down with water at about 6:30.  In fact, we took so much St. John's that we got messed up off of that and started to contemplate wether we needed to eat mushrooms to have fun that night.  But in honor of our weekend tradition, we ate the mushrooms.  At 7:30 we ate.  I ate 5g raw in about 5 minutes.  I put 1 gram in my mouth and chewed it with my gum without swallowing.  I felt the onset within 15 minutes so it takes the edge off coming up.
336	We quickly rode our bikes to a store to buy some tarp so that we could lay on that without getting too dirty.  That took us 20 minutes, by now I was starting to get visuals and I knew that we needed to hurry to our destination before I got so bad that I couldn't ride my bike.  When we got to the entrance of the park, it was 8:15 or so.  This park is amazing, the ground is covered in moss and the trees are very 'spooky' on the flat ground.  By this time I couldn't ride my bike so we parked them and started to walk up the side of the hill.  This was very hard, the ground was mossy and moving like a ocean of algae.  When we walked up the side of the hill, I thought that I was floating and falling at the same time.  We finally reached our destination at 8:30, exactly one hour after our supper.  We laid out the tarp and laid down.  This time we didn't talk at all.  I don't know how long we laid there, I started to here bongos down by the river and people singing in japanese.  I closed my eyes and let myself drift away to teh abyss.  I started to get hallucinations like I never had before except my first time.  I saw only white with spinning colors and sounds of monkees screaching softly.  My visuals slowly changed into a large with room with fantastic translucent colors swirling and chasing around.  The monkees and bongos started getting louder.  I knew that it was time to leave the abyss before the sounds got out of control.
337	All track of time was lost.  When I finally opened my eyes I had night vision.  Everything was in black in white, but with the same translucent spinning colors.  When I looked up to the trees I saw silouettes of monkees holding hands, tails and feet.  They started moving and grew eyes, and other features.  I felt as if I was turning back into a monkee.  Losing my corrupt human spirit and going back to what we should be, a pure and innocent being.  My friend and I started talking and we got up and walked around a bit in the forest.  All of a sudden we stopped talking.  I saw a hobbit like creature running across, the hobbit looked at me and ran toward me.  It looked at me and then pointed to the sky above me.  It said 'The moon'  I looked at the moon, when I turned my head, the hobbit had disappeared.  We decided to go to downtown and get some coffee.  When we looked at a clock, we realized that it was almost 1 a.m.  I was still getting amazing open eye visuals.
338	This was the best trip that I ever had.  After doing mushrooms in nature, the best place I think, I can never look at things the same way.

341	A couple of days ago I purchased 25g of Thai Mushrooms. The next day after saying the appropriate prayers to the mushroom spirits, my spirit guides and power animals, I cleaned them and ate most of them the night of the full moon (saturday). I left a small mushroom to be offered back to mother earth the next day. 
342	For a while nothing happened and then I closed my eyes and was transported to a friends house in Brighton (I live in London). My friend was hunched over the computer working away and told me to fuck off as he was busy. I ignored his request and proceeded to give him a shamanic healing. Then I was with another friend, I entered her body and ended up looking out at the world through her eyes. I left her body and then we made love. 
343	I think what happened next is that I went through a multitude of dismemberment experiences--I was swallowed and then spat out by giant beings. It took a while for me to be reassembled and at first I was given the wrong head back. Evil entities appeared and started laughing and mocking me for having inappropriate body parts. The Mushroom spirits told me that I had to lie still all night, without eating, drinking or talking and that I would only be reassembled in the morning. They told me not to go to the toilet as the guy I share a toilet with would also try to eat me. After a while they relented and let me be reanimated. Then I had a vision of a man on horseback who approached me with a sword. He pierced me in the stomach with it, then gave me a book containing knowledge about which plants to use to heal people with and the mushrooms said that in the future I should ask them what page to turn to in the book to find the right plant to heal people with. I was also presented with a sword, the ownership of which I rejected and given a new body of finest gilded metal, together with a lot of new mushroomy knowledge and a new tongue to replace the one that had been cut out at some point in the evening. 
344	The mushroom spirits wanted me to undergo more dismemberment but I told them that I couldn't deal with any more that night The mushroom spirits wanted me to undergo more dismemberment but I told them that I couldn't deal with any more that night so they relented, realising that otherwise I would crack up. During the evening the mushroom spirits were communicating with me telepathically and they told me that I had to go into and merge with the wall. After doing this I got a glimpse of the mushroom spirit. He was a little man who closely resembled a mushroom and talked in a variety of voices (he sang like a virgin in a high pitched female voice and then started talking in a gruff northern accent). 
345	By this point the experience began to subside and I cried a few tears. The rest of the night I lay awake feeling tired and energised and integrated the experience whilst becoming aware that the trees outside my window were being killed slowly by the vehicles driving by.

348	This was certainly one of the best days I've had in a long time. I pick up my friend, well call him M. We come back to my house and eat 2 grams of dried mushrooms each, with a glass of orange juice.
349	We started watching Grandma's boy, which is great. About halfway through the movie we could really feel it. People started changing colors, it looked like my ceiling was made of worms. 
350	Upon standing I felt dizzy and had a hard time walking. My hands seemed to be unreal. My pupils became so dilated I could hardly tell  what color my eyes were. We then started watching that 70's show, a crazy episode, a Halloween episode. It was so trippy we watched it twice.
351	After it was over and we ate some burgers we just started talking about life. How this is our senior year, and it's half over. All the school we've gone through all comes down to 5 seconds in June. 
352	I know it's not too detailed. I had no bad experience at all, this is my 2nd time with shrooms and I'm gonna try to hook up an ounce soon. I drink now and then and smoke daily, but this has become my favorite thing to do. 
353	It's put my life into perspective, my relationships, people around me, ect. I have a greater appreciation and a newfound happiness.

356	One day I decided to try some mushrooms. So I headed to my friends house. When I arrived there he whipped out an eighth of shrooms and a half ounce of bud. We split the mushrooms and rolled a fat doobie. I ate the mushrooms then we smoked a joint to take off.
357	About twenty minutes later I started feeling the effects of the shrooms. I was sitting in a chair it looked like a bunch of flys were flying all over one flew towards my face it slowed down and I could see right in its eyes. We decided to go outside because my friend said it's alot trippier outside. When we walked out the colors were very bright and vibrant. I started hearing things like birds and buzzing in my head. My friend and I were talking but I could'nt comprehend what he was saying it sounded fucked up.
358	After that we went back inside and threw half baked in the vcr. The movie started I didn't really understand it but all the noises sounded cool. I looke at an old movie case with a fairy on it it looked like it was dancing to the music in the movie. Aboutr 7 hours after I ate them I started going down.

362	Saturday. I became convinced that the mushrooms are actually portals to a more intense and solid consciouness.  I experienced the essence of birth and creation.  I again practiced the tai chi boxing but this time, instead of healing my body (that happened last time) my body, mind, and spritual connection felt very powerful yang energy.  Male, powerful, forceful.  I saw that it acts against what is dark and that the tai chi energy boxing is a remedy against evil in all its forms.  It heals the body and the mind and allows the eternal spirit to cleanse the darkness with light.  The dark had no remedy for this power.  The darkness was constantly tricked by the power of the light.  When an obstacle would present itself I became insubstantial (yin) only, AT THE SAME TIME to appear behind the darkness and drive it away.
363	There was, and is, no doubt in my mind that the mushrooms are, indeed, magical and that they are portals to universal experience, understanding, and wisdom.
364	Of course, don't forget, I took quite a few of these little buggers, but, yes, it worked.

367	It was a brisk fall night around 8 oclock and I was home alone at the time, Just me half an ounce of weed and my mushrooms. So I simply heated up sum pizza put my mushrooms on the pizza and ate it is now about 9:30, rite after I ate and decided to smoke a few bowls out of my bong.
368	Then my parents got back and the adventure began, now my parents are of the strictest of all and smoking or drugs of any kind was certainly not aloud, But seeing as I was on them anyways I figured who cares, so I moved up out of the basement in my room were I continued to smoke, door wide open, then the shrooms kicked in and hard, I slowly felt my self falling out of one world and passing into the next, I felt my self seeing things that cannot be written things of unimaginable meaning and beauty, and yet I felt still that I had not reached the level of beauty and true reality that I was looking for, so it was then that I began to smoke, again.
369	Then I remembered that I had some left over syrian rue seeds so I began to chew on them I had about 6 or 8 caps worth. After this point I reached the level that I was looking for and it was then that the climax began. It was now around 11:30 and I decided that I had to go on a journey to find the boundaries of reality, it was then that I left my house to go and wander the world so weed lighter and pipe in hand I began this quest, I had walked about ¼ of a mile when a large chariot of angels approached and the chariot stopped and I climbed on, all ready riding the chariot was two beings one with hair of fire and the other was unseen just a dark outline, (this turned out being my friend in his big white hummer and his read head girlfriend). It was then that while riding the glorious chariot that I explored the boundaries of reality, using what seemed like the speed of light we traveled the world, but one of the beings, the one with hair made of fire fell of and fell into the world around us, It was then that I pulled out my tools and began to burn all of the trees in the basin (I started smoking again). Suddenly though I too fell of the glorious chariot into the world surrounding me it was then that I wandered through every place of unfamiliarity until I reached a familiar place, I had by this time walked about 4 miles and it was probably around 3 o clock in the morning and I then finally found my house, I walked in and climbed to the clouds where I blessed my burnt offerings and burned them (incense) and I again burned the trees in the basin, at this point I finally fell into a dream that I cannot even describe or explain.

372	My friends and I had planned this night out for a couple days now, and already had our mushrooms. This was one of the girls first time ever and about my third. I wanted to really trip out this time so I decided to get us all 5 grams each and assured them that they would be fine. We were at some guys house and he had no food so was downed them with a cup of water. About an hour later we felt all giggly and cool chillen with all our friends. We split a joint between the three of us and were having a great time.
373	At one time I got up to go stand in the hall, the hall felt very long and stange, I felt very out of place. I asked my friends if we could leave. Our only way home was to take the bus. It was definetly about -15C outside, and was so cold waiting for that bus. The bus came every 40 minutes and we had just missed it. It felt like we were out there for about 20 minutes talking about everything, but once I looked at my watch I noticed only 5 minutes had gone by. Then all of a sudden this car pulled us with a guy and a girl in the front and some guy in the back. They said they noticed us out here and offered us a ride. I said yes just to get out of the cold. So us three girls squished in the back.
374	So here we are in some guys car we have never met driving across town. We took back roads that all looked so unfamiliar,and thats when I started to freak out. We started down the big hill that soon crossed a river, and as I looked at the road coming up, it was all winding and slithering like a snake. Then the driver turns all the way around in his seat and starts talking to us. I freak out to this day I do not know if he knew we were tripping out or if he himself was messed up, but I was just waiting for the car to go off the bridge. 
375	Once back to my friends house we get out and thank them. We quickly went downstairs where we talked for about 3 hours in the corner about I dont even know. Thats when I tried to stand up and I couldnt. I told me friends and neither could they. All we could do was crawl, so we crawled around, as if we were babies. And slowly we could start to stand up, and run and skip around, and thats when her little brother came down and started running around as if we were all little kids. Soon we just chilled, and grabbed her guitar and jammed for a while as if going throw a life. After that we all lay down in our beds and talked about death and soon fell asleep which all seemed to be the stages of life, and we went through them all in just one night. 
376	It was all a good trip, one that I will never forget.
377	It first started kicking in when we were talking to some people online, I remember looking at the curtains and they waved and formed into weird squares.

380	My friends' 18th birthday was approaching and we decided to celebrate by having our first real mushroom trip. The morning of, my buddies and I set out to buy. We ended up with a good count which resulted in all three of us consuming 3.5 g each. We did this on near-empty stomachs about 15 minutes before eating dinner with the birthday boy's parents in their kitchen. When my pals B, D, and myself were halfway through dinner I started to feel a sort of anxiousness. Near the end of dinner, I took a glance at the butter container, which depicted two smiling slices of bread, one with a butter knife. The one with the knife began to stab the other one, yet both retained their little smirks. That made me realize we shouldn't be hanging around people's parents at the moment. I bolted up out of my chair and tried to casually walk downstairs, ignoring the intense headrush induced by standing.
381	Once we got to the basement, everyone was feeling it. I remember staring curiously at the couch in the basement. It was velvet and had a floral pattern that seemed to grow down the couch and on to the floor, meeting the stucco that had been melting off the ceiling. We began to watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a fucked up movie even for those who aren't on psychoactive fungi. I suddenly understood much of what the characters were going through. A green balloon positioned near a window cast its emerald colours all over the floor and walls. Halfway through the movie, B and D decided we should go for a walk. We left B's house about an hour before sunset.
382	It was a humid summer evening and I could see the last few rays of the sun shimmering off the light mist near the forest. We walked through the fog and into the forest, noting our oneness with nature, and writing down everything that came to us, much of which dealt with pirates. D began furiously hammering out nonsense ramblings in his notebook and the most fucked up part about the forest was that when we came out on the other side, it was suddenly dark. We sat on the damp grass and contemplated such things as war, poverty, and what to do with our lives. We then wandered the streets like the mind-fucked little weirdos we were, pausing to investigate shiny things such as mailboxes or street lights. 
383	When the evening drew to a close, I caught a bus home. For the whole ride and for a few hours after trying to go to bed, all I could think of was how much I loved people and wanted to help them. The best part of the whole thing was the couple of hours after the trip, where everything is still noticeably different. I've done shrooms many times since, but nothing can compare to the time I first went out and got nice and tweaked with my friends.

386	Christmas time rolled around, and becoming a stoner my freshman year of highschool, I wanted to try something stronger....I had been really interested in the idea of hallucinating so I bought an eighth of my good friend T. The eigth consisted of a big cap, one smaller one, and two stems...
387	That night I sat in my bed and contemplated eating a cap (my parents were asleep in the next room). I figured what the hell and downed the largest cap.....I thought it tasted like chocolate the first couple of bites, and after that it got disgusting...
388	I look at my hand and it is bigger than normal. 'its kicking in' I thought. As I reached for my glass of water, my arm stretched intensly. I really dug this...id never really hallucinated before, and already felt as if I was going to enjoy this trip.
389	I got up and started towards the kitchen to retreive some cheetos..in order for you to get to my kitchen you must pass by the christmas tree, and when I saw that damned thing, I hadnt the foggiest notion what I was looking at - The lights were swirling and the tree was bending down at me. I particularly remember the sweet smell of pine (I love that smell) however I then realize our tree does not have a scent at all. As soon as I realize this the smell is gone.
390	I turn away and head for the kitchen...I opened the pantry door and saw all the bags and cans...all seemed alien...I grab the bag of cheetos and start walking to my room.. I was so damn sure I was going to spill these cheetos (the bag was sealed with a paper clip) that I walked at speeds of three back to my lair... 
391	NOTE: this walking experience was very similar to the walking on DXM
392	As soon as I get there I lay down and eat the munchies....
393	About ten minutes of that pass and I turn on some trance and trip on the visions in my head. Every beat a new circle would appear, in all different colors.. This went on for what must have been an hour.
394	I look over to the corner of my room and see my coconut monkey (a monkey made out of a coconut). As soon as I turned my head, I would see in my perifferals it looking at me... I stand up and continue to reason with the monkey, telling it to stop looking at me..
395	After that, I felt really beat so I tried to fall asleep - but with no luck...I layed there and triped on my window, which appeared to be a bubbling cauldrin of some sort...
396	I FINALLY drifted off to bed, and awoke very tired for school...
397	Overall id say it was a pretty cool experience.

400	My experiance began one month ago.  After a hectic saturday night I was woken up that sunday morning to a friend beating on my dorm door.  I initially pretended I wasn't there but after awhile I decided to give in a find out what he wanted.  I opened the doorm, SHROOMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I FOUND SHROOMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He exclaimed.  After about 7 hours and 20 bucks he manifested the shrooms for me and a few of my friends.  There were 7 of us and we all bought an eighth.  I told my friends I was going to wait to take the shrooms, seeing as they all have a high level of suggestability and I wanted to truly experience the effects and not have to wade through everyone elses star gazing reports.  
401	Anyways I finally give in a eat my eighth in a few friends dorms with a soda and go meet my other friends downstairs.  About 45 minutes after eating the shrooms my old roommate comes by and suggests that we go to to the convience store and get some snacks and I agree.  On the way there I began to feel the shrooms and I started to get freaked out as I was looking at some bushes, realizing that they resembled spiders then I began to think if I did start to see things they would become spiders as well.  To my good fortune or misfortune depending on how you look at it I had no visions.  
402	Anyways at the c store I began to realize the full effect and my newly found 'powers' became manifest.  I could pick up items or just touch them and feel their intrensic goodness or evil depending on what they were.  I soon learned to avoid all things which would be a downer and as I touched different surfaces they began to radiate throughout my body giving me the giggles.  Finally we made it back to my dorm and I sat on an old familiar couch and I started laughing uncontrolably.  As I was laughing it sounded like the laughing was a giggle comming from a dawrf from a far away land which at the time made the situation all the more funnier.  I probably laughted for a good 5 hours on and off.  I know I'm not the greatest writer and for those of you who have suffered through this I'm sorry. I felt almost that if I had expected it, it would have been different.  Good look and happy hunting.

405	One Friday night, I was with my friend TK and E. I had just bought two caps of chocolate covered mushrooms from a friend of mine. One cap for me, and the other for TK. E was baby sitting
406	Me and TK went over to E's house. We stayed in the family room, and around 11:30 PM me and TK ate the mushrooms. They tasted great! Chocolate covered mushrooms are the way to go. Anyway we started playing video games to pass the time. Around 12, my body starts feeling twichy and waves feel like they are going up my body. A basic weed body high feeling for me. Then I enter my new world. What happened was I looked across the room at a vase full of flowers, and the flowers moved slowly back and forth, like there was a gentle breeze, but there was no breeze. I looked over to TK who was twitching a bit and said 'Hey, do those flowers look like they are moving to you?' He looked over at them and said 'Ohhh man' then he went completely crazy, the high hit him like a ton of bricks. He claimed his brain would twitch, which caused his entire body to jerk around, and he laughed uncontrollably.
407	I was half in mushroom world and half in the real world. I would twitch and laugh uncontrollably, but I could settle myself if I needed to. It was around 12:30 now, and a little after then I felt the full effects.
408	Me and TK would get up walk around, and then fall over, it felt like our muscles would just give up on us. It was fun, everything was incredibly entertaining, and we were completely care free. We made up our own games, such as switching a light switch on and off very fast, or turning the tap water on and off while trying to catch it in our hands. To me this care free playfullness was truly the mind of a child. We even giggled and laughed like children.
409	Around 2:00 we were becoming our own selves again, but we were agitated. I don't know why TK was but I was because I missed feeling like a child, and being care free. Also we both got terrible stomache cramps. Overrall though, the trip was amazing, and I will deffinatly do it again, and I am happy to know that somewhere inside my mind, there is still that care free happiness of a child.

412	I am 18 years old and experienced ego death after consuming about 2g of 'magic mushrooms.' I should state that I had no intention of having ego death. Anyway, it didn't take long for the trip to become overwhelming. I remembered a friend telling me not to fight a trip. So I relaxed and let things happen, and instead of going into a downward spiral like many people do, it felt like the opposite happened. I experienced oneness, and felt that I was everyone, everything. I saw through infinite eyes (like in the trippy pictures :3 lol) I lost myself and didn't care. I came under the impression that the entire universe was simply a single mind. A mind that sprung up out of infinite nothingness. A lonely, insane mind. All that exists is contained within this mind. It seemed to me, during this trip, that life as we know it is how the mind copes with it's infinite existence. For what seemed like a very long time I was severely aware of time stretching forward, and how existence could never be escaped. It was painful to experience this part, because during that time I wanted nothing more than to not have to exist anymore...but I'm glad it happened. This entire trip was certainly mind-expanding and has improved the quality of my life.

415	This is just another one of the mind expanding experiences I've had thanks to drugs. The day before this trip I had taken a 1/4 Roll of a 'CP' pressed ecstasy (which am I assuming made my serotonin levels unbalanced for my trip). I bought 3.5gs of shroom caps from a hippie that sells me great acid and potent shrooms. I've had good and bad mushroom trips in the past with visuals, mind fucks, etc... This trip I had extremely faint visuals that I had to focus my complete attention on.
416	I ground the caps (mushrooms w/o the stems) up and filled them into seven .5g capsules and ate them around 8pm. During the trip I became bored of this low serotonin mediocre head space so I decide to roll all my weed into joints. I smoked an hour after dosing to alleviate any nausea, this brought nothing to my trip. I facetimed my girlfriend, although we conversed it was difficult for me to bring up topics while I rolled joints on my desk. Less difficult than say being loaded on 500mics of Cid. When I saw my face in the selfie camera I could see my face looking 'Shroomy' but not the 'crackhead' look of Acid.
417	I found this trip neither good or bad, but a waste of $40. Perhaps I had a weak strain of shrooms (which is not likely from my hippy) so I accredit this wasted trip to my MDMA use the night before. Moral of the story, I'll stick to the green sticky icky if I plan on taking a trip into my sub-conscious anytime soon.

420	It was one mushroom.  I didn't think I should 'put all my eggs in one basket' by eating only one, but the fucker weighed six grams, dry, so I said what the hell.  
421	It took a long time to set in It took a long time to set in; I didn't chew it up like I should have.  We watched SNL, waiting for them to kick in.  I was feeling moderately trippy, but nothing mind blowing. 
422	Then it hit me.  My body temperature jumped what felt like thirty degrees; I was sweating my ass off.  My hands and arms began to tingle.  Then the visuals hit.  It was a myriad of kaleidoscopes I could not concentrate on...I thought I better lay down to get my bearings.  I laid down on the bed and immediately felt better.  Began watching 'Balls Out: Gary the Tennis Coach.'  After the visuals subsided a bit, I was able to concentrate on the movie.  And it was hilarious.  After that movie ended I watched Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. I was so enamored by the colors and details, I couldn't follow the story.  Ended the night listening to the Ipod.  The music was unbelievable. I tripped with my significant other and couldn't help but realize my paranoia, though. Paranoid thoughts ran rampant for a couple hours. I guess that's why McKenna called 5g + a heroic trip. Don't think this amount could have been done in a social setting.... 
423	The night was spent watching movies; I don't think I would have been capable of anything else.  I am a psilocybe veteran and this is without a doubt the most mind blowing experience I have ever had.  And it was one mushroom!!  This was the third flush of a liquid culture produced casing.  I guess the fungus is getting stronger as I am getting older.  
424	All in all, one of the best experiences on psilocybin in my lifetime.  Don't know if it can be matched. Gonna lower the dose a bit for next time; I like scaring the shit out of myself, but only every so often.  And this time, I definitely hit that mark.

427	Me and my good friend 'Big Puppy', decided to have the mushrooms. I have tripped repeatedly over five times by then, thought i would not be as much affected, had good expectations and was in good mood.
428	After the ingestion it did not take long for the effects to take in. I started off with severe nausea and discomfort, probobaly due to my hang over from night before. We left the house and went to the beach, where the waves and the faces of people were so harmonically outlandish. By this point i was experiencing a total connection with my friend, we spoke and it made sense completely. We came to the conclusion that people are too busy running places and never stop to think and enjoy the moment. it was as though we were in a time warp where everything just stopped and we were there seeing all of the universe, the big picture, the evolution the history, everything made sense, the small details, our purpose in life, best trip ever. LOVED WHAT THE MUSHROOMS SHOWED ME ANd my Friend, BIG PUPPY>

431	I've been smoking pot since I was 13 on a daily basis, save for a few 1-4 month breaks here and there. It's been one of the few things I had to look forward to. I loved everything about it, the smell, the plants, crumbling up a nug and packing it into a bowl, smelling my fingers afterwards, it was heaven for me, and I thought I needed it.
432	I had spent my whole childhood moving from town to town. I had no friends, nothing made me happy, and I had been constantly bullied by my peers. At one point near the end of 8th grade, I was smoking 2-3 grams a day (might not be much for the reader, but a lot for me). I tried stopping for a few weeks and felt like shit, so I continued through the summer.
433	Then high school came around. We had moved back to a town we lived in a few years ago so my dad could work at a school in a nearby town. My dad wanted me to join Speech and Debate, and I agreed as long as I could still smoke. But there was a catch. Because of well-meaning but ignorant anti-drug initiative on the school's part, they had to drug test us for every student activity, meaning I couldn't smoke pot. This devastated me. 
434	I pleaded my dad to let me quit, but he said no. I was pissed at this. I knew I needed to get high somehow, but I didn't know how. Then I noticed the bag of mushrooms in my dad's room. I snuck in, opened the bag, and pocketed some. I went for a walk on a golf course, deserted since it was mid-October, nowhere near the tourist season. I ate a small stem and a cap, waited a bit, and walked back home. When I went back to my room, I started to feel funny. Everything seemed different somehow, I noticed a pulsing, static-like pressure in the back of my head, and I spent a half hour laughing my ass off making funny faces in the mirror. When my dad opened the door is when things started to get messed up.
435	I vacuumed my room, folded and put away my laundry, and cooked dinner all while tripping. I ate another mushroom after that. It was certainly not a good idea. My dad burst into my room, yelling at me about stealing his weed. He searched my room while I flushed the joints I was saving for after the drug test down the toilet in the next room. He apologized for the intrusion after he found nothing, and went to his room. A few seconds later, I hear him yell ******, GET OVER HERE RIGHT NOW! just as I was hitting the peak.
436	Before you know it I was being yelled at and grilled by my dad trying to make me throw up while the floor tiles were moving and the walls were breathing. I was absolutely terrified. After I threw up I started breaking down crying. My dad realized he may have been a bit too harsh with me. He put me on the couch and rubbed my legs while I got the rest of the fear out of my system. I told him about everything, my suicide attempt, my sexuality, and any other shit I had inside. He told me about how his mom used to do the same thing when he came home drunk late at night. After that, we sat on the couch eating popcorn and watching funny cartoons.
437	I feel like that trip changed me. Ever since then, i've been less superficial and materialistic. I also understood the value of sobriety, and how taking a break can be a good thing. I got my shit together and had more success in my high school career than I ever thought I would have. I still smoke pot and have had a few more mushroom trips since then, along with DXM and LSA, but I have been far more careful with drugs since then.

440	One friday night I was hanging out with my brother and his friends and we were waiting for our shrooms to arrive. Soon enough we got them. My friends told me to take them around 5ish when everyone else was going to. So I did that.
441	There were nine people in our group and only five of us were gooming. Then we walked down to taco bell while it was still light out. Around 5:30 I started to feel it kick in. I started to see the sidewalk craks flow together and it looked like one huge square in the sidewalk. The walk felt like it took forever but I didn't care I was enjoying this so far, I liked the first hour of my trip.
442	Once the five people I was with had got to taco bell, the other four went somewhere else and they were going to meet us there. So once we got there I started to feel very strange. I felt like nothing was right, I did not want to have any belongings on me. I felt that my clothes weren't suppose to be on. I felt everything I did was not suppose to feel this way. Then I started to worry about where my brother was I was getting really scared because I was stuck with four other goomers like they would take the time to help me. I started to say to myself ' why did I do this, this was fucking stupid '. Then I called my brother on my cell and he tried to help me over the phone but he couldn't so I had to wait until he got there luckily he wasn't too far away. When I ended my call I looked at my phone and it was so small probably about 4 cm. Big in the palm of my hand.
443	Then once my brother arrived it was too late for him to cheer me up and get me back to feeling good. He kept on asking me all these questions and it kept on pissing me off cause I couldn't answer any of his useless shit. I tried to have fun but I couldn't it was just too hard so I started to worry even more. I started to feel that I wanted things that were not even there. I didn't know what I wanted. One second I would want this person to be here then I would want the next person to be there. I couldn't control it. So my brother took me inside of taco bell into the bathroom so I could see what I looked like and see what was going on with my eyes. My pupils were huge and everything seemed stary. I looked at my hand it was changing the colors of the rainbow. That didn't really scar me too much it kinda calmed me down.
444	Then the rest of the night I sat at the table we were at and everyone was trying to make me feel good and it was helping a lot. My trip turned out to be pretty cool once it was all over. I look back on that night to this day and I say that was one of the best nights I have had my whole entire life. Even though I had a bad trip its not going to stop me from trying it again.

447	We stepped foot on the campground at about 7:00am. Once we reached the end of Trailhead 1 we paused for a quick moment and looked out at what was before us. During this time, Dick took a deep breath in, smiled, and exclaimed 'Ah! Folk Fest!' This was my first time attending this crazy festival, and after only the first 10 seconds I knew I was in for one Hell of a memorable weekend. We had driven all night long to get here as early as possible. Who were 'we', you ask? Well, we were a strange mix of individuals with loose connections to one another.
448	There was, of course, me. Next, we had Dick. Dick had worked as a cook at Strawberry's before I was hired there in July 2002. Dick owned The Melvin House, which is a house notorious for its parties and its interesting blend of visitors. It was the kind of house you could just show up to at any time of day and, as long as you knew someone there and you weren't terribly annoying, you were welcome to stay for a few drinks or hit of weed. You could even stay for supper, as long as you did your fair share of the cleanup afterward. The general rule was that you respect the privacy of those who lived there, you take out what you bring in, and you respect the property. Anyone who could abide by these rules and who didn't overstay their welcome could drop by during any reasonable hour of the day and just relax with whoever else was there. This system worked better than you might think. Everyone got along, and nobody got the place into any trouble. This paved the way for some monumentally successful parties around New Year's and July 1st.
449	Also part of the Folk Fest crew that year was Bev, whom I'd worked with quite frequently at the 'berry. And, finally, there was Tedray. Tedray was by far the standout member of our group. While Dick, Bev, and myself were all within a year of each other in our early-to-mid twenties, Tedray was 50-something. He was also a Caribbean immigrant. Blacker than the dead of night. His long black hair was quickly going gray. He wore it in loose dreadlocks that hung almost to the ground. He spoke with an extremely thick reggae-type accent. He not only stood out among our group of four - he stood out among everyone at the festival. On top of it all, he was by far the most outgoing and social of us all. This was a blessing. In large part thanks to Tedray, our small group of tents became the centre of attention on Friday night. I'll get to that...
450	Getting to Folk Fest was a bit of a fluke in itself. First of all, as late as Thursday afternoon, we didn't have our tickets, which had already been paid for and were supposed to have arrived. The plan was to leave The Melvin House after Dick got off work Thursday, drive overnight and pitch our tents bright and early Friday morning before the Sun came up and scorched us. I got to The Melvin House sometime in the afternoon on Thursday and sat around in the living room chatting with a few others about the upcoming weekend. Some of them had gone previous years, and they all had positive things to say about their experiences. I was getting psyched just thinking about it. Dick showed up after not too long and asked if Paco had shown up with the tickets yet. Paco's real name is Anthony (I'm not sure why everyone calls him Paco), and he was a cook at Strawberry's. We had all given him our money for the festival and camping passes with the understanding that he would put it all on his credit card. Paco didn't plan to go that year, but for some reason it was easiest to have him buy the tickets. Maybe he had a Ticketmaster account or something. I'm not sure. Well, Paco had not shown up, and repeated calls to his cellphone had gone unanswered. Dick starts to worry. I held my cool, figuring everything would sort itself out. A few hours later, maybe around 9:00pm or so, Bev shows up at The Melvin House. 'Can anyone get ahold of Paco?' To relieve the tension that was quickly building up, we all sat down and passed around a few joints. It was approaching 10:00pm now, and we were dreading having to either postpone the festival by a day, or worse yet, a year. Soon enough, lights flood into the living room. Paco's white car pulls into the driveway! There is much rejoicing, although we did give him shit for not answering his cell. Nonetheless, he takes out his wallet and distributes the tickets to Bev, Dick, and myself. 'Alright, Benson, Bev, pack your shit up, we need to collect the black man, and then we're off.' says Dick after a huge sigh of relief.
451	After organizing all of our stuff in the back of Bev's very small car we went and grabbed Tedray. We definitely could have used a bigger vehicle. Tedray and I were in the back, each having to hold at least two backpacks full of gear on our laps. Now, we had brought along a fair amount of mary jane under the assumption (the very wrong assumption) that it might be difficult to find any once we got to the Fest. We had an 8-hour drive ahead of us, so somewhere around Kakabeka Falls we decided to put some in a pipe, throw on some Tragically Hip, and get in the zone for awhile. We couldn't have picked a worse time to do this. After the pipe had made its way around the circle twice, we turned a corner on the road. And that's when we saw the lights. About 500 meters ahead of us was a RIDE program. Immediately, the sunroof was opened, all the windows were rolled down, Visine was passed out. The bag of weed was quickly hidden in the dashboard (a very obvious location, in retrospect). 'Looks like no Folk Fest this year,' said Dick. We argued. 'Let's just keep everything cool, do whatever the cop asks, don't debate anything with him. Let's be straight about this. Just keep it level.' Bev was driving, so we agreed not to say a word. We would let him do the talking.
452	'Good evening, guys. Any of you been drinking tonight?'
453	'Where are you boys headed to? Looks like you're going camping.'
454	'Yeah, we're heading to the Folk Festival in Winnipeg.'
455	And then the Rastafarian speaks up out of nowhere.
456	'Jah, maun! Gonna mek some myoozik drummin' on some pig skin, donch'know!'
457	'Oh yeah?' said the cop. 'Do a little drumming. Smoke a little reefer. It stinks like Hell in this car, boys. Let's see the dope.'
458	Well, that was it, I thought. We were going to get charged with possession, driven to the nearest station, our parents called, and worst of all, we were going to miss Folk Fest. After a bit of hesitation, Bev eventually gave up the bag of weed and the pipe to the officer. He apologized on behalf of us all and admitted that we'd done something stupid. None of us had breasts (Dick had small ones), so we had no way of getting out of this. We were all told to get out of the car and stand on the side of the road while the vehicle was searched. Another officer came around and asked us for our wallets so he could jot down some of our credentials. We very eagerly gave them up, hoping that our 100% cooperation would help get us off the hook. But how? We were already caught. After a few minutes, the officer came back over to us and asked Tedray to follow him. We watched Tedray being brought to a cruiser and before we knew it he was being handcuffed and put in the back seat. WAIT A SECOND! Was this actually happening??? Were they scapegoating the black guy? Bev had admitted to the officer that it was his own weed. Why were they taking Tedray away? I had to speak up.
459	'Excuse me, officer. That wasn't his bag of dope. The officer who stopped us already knows this.'
460	'Your friend has an outstanding unpaid fine for an unrelated incident. We're just talking to him.'
461	About 10 minutes later, we were told to get back in our car. The three of us, anyway. So, we did. The officer that first stopped us came back to the car a few minutes later.
462	'Alright, the car looks clean and so does all your stuff. Except, which one of you is John?'
463	'I found a film cap with some pills in your backpack. Want to tell me what those are about?'
464	I thought for a second. What was he talking about? Did he get my bag mixed up with someone else's? I didn't have any pills. Oh, yes I did! But they were nothing illegal.
465	'To be honest, officer, I'm not exactly sure what those are. I found that film cap a few days ago at work in the break room. I had meant to turn them in to the front desk, but I forgot to. I think they're someone's medication. I really have no use for them, though. If you need to take them, that's fine.'
466	'Alright, that's fine. Look, you boys know that marijuana is illegal. I don't have to tell you that. It may be legal someday, but it's not yet. And, until it is, I don't want to see you guys with any of it. We're taking the dope and your pipe. None of you have any criminal history, so I'll consider this a one-time offense. I'm going to let you go to your festival, but this is being noted in the books. Next time, we're not going to be so forgiving. Have a good weekend, gentlemen.'
467	The officer left us alone and within seconds, Tedray was opening the door and getting back in the car. We started down the road and Dick asked the obvious question:
468	'Tedray, man. How did you convince them to let you go?'
469	'Because I'm a maun of da world, Dickery. I know tings you won't eva know, maun. Don't ask a black maun a stupid question li' dat. Let's get to dis festivool so I ken start drummin'!'
470	Classic Tedray :) And, with that, we were off!
471	As previously stated, we arrived onsite around 7:00am Friday morning. The sky was one huge gray cloud. Everything was wet. There was a nice cool breeze blowing, which was wonderful to step into after spending the last 8 hours in a small car with three other men and 20 pounds of camping equipment on your lap. We began to make our way through the maze of tents in search of an area big enough to pitch four of our own. We had a couple options on where we could do this. Ideally, we were looking for a fire pit, if possible. We also wanted to be not too far from a shower or a water tap. We wanted to be out of the way of the rows of toilets, out of the main flow of traffic near the trailheads. In short, we wanted to be pretty much centralized so that we weren't too far from the action, no matter where the action happened to manifest itself over the following days and nights. As we were walking around in search of the ideal spot, we were approached by a hippie with red dreadlocks and a large beard.
472	'Yeah. It must have rained last night, eh?' asked Dick.
473	'Yep. There was a pretty good storm. Nice electrical show from Mother Nature. You guys would have loved it.' said the hippie. 'My name is Heart.'
474	We introduced ourselves. Tedray joked that his dreadlocks were longer than Heart's. We talked for a bit, and inevitably mentioned our close call on the way to the festival.
475	'That sucks about your weed, man. But, good on you for making it here. If you're looking for anything, just come find me. I'm the tent with the Canadian flag above it over in Campsite 3.'
476	'What exactly do you have to offer?' asked Dick.
477	'Well, I can sell you some pot since the cops are getting high off yours. It's from BC, so it's pretty good. Also, if you're into it, I've got mushroom brownies. There's about a gram in each brownie.'
478	'We'll come see you about the brownies later, but do you think we could pick up some weed right now?'
479	And with that, we had our connection for the weekend.
480	We walked past the first lining of trees that separates Campsite 1 from Campsite 2. There was an incredibly large open space that nobody had yet occupied, and it had a fire pit right in the centre. Our first instinct was to set up there, but I suggested against it. Upon closer inspection, we noticed that there was a very large circle of white boulders separated by about 3 feet each, bordering this wide open area. We concluded that this area was being reserved for some sort of activity. So, we parked our gear a few feet outside of the circle. Whatever was going to take place here, we would have front row seats :) Predictably, we rolled up a joint with the stuff we'd bought from Heart. As the Sun started to shine brighter and hotter, I began to notice more and more people walking around the campsite. I took a walk around, just to explore, and I was absolutely shocked at the amount of people there were! There was barely enough space to walk between the tents without tripping on the cords helping to peg them down! Once nighttime hit, I didn't know how the Hell I was going to find my way around. I was having trouble figuring it out in pure daylight! I figured that the wide open area would be a fairly good indicator of where I was, so I didn't spend much time worrying about this problem. Several of the tents had homemade flags or decorations flying above them or pegged into the ground beside them. I tried to picture how this whole place would look lit up once nightfall came. Let me say, the picture I had in my mind was NOTHING close to what it's actually like.
481	I should try to give a bit of a description on the layout of Folk Fest. This can be hard to explain without drawing a picture, but I'll try my best. For the sake of this description, assume that once you actually enter the campground itself from any of the trailheads you are facing north. Directly to your north is the main camping area. If you've just entered from Trailhead 1, then the whole campground is to the right of you. Trailheads 2a and 2b bring you closer to the middle of the camping area, so you would have tents to both your left and right if you entered from there. Further to the right are more Trailheads (3 and 4) with still more camping ground in front of you. Most of the loud, crazy parties (and the bulk of the people) camp in the areas directly north of Trailheads 1, 2a, 2b, and 3. A little further to the right you'll hit Trailheads 5 and 6. These are considered separate from the main campgrounds and they have a different feel to them. One of them is generally filled with tipis. I'm not sure what goes on there. Another smaller area in the far right is where you'd find your RV people. If you wish to bring your RV and camp in it, you can, but you have to go to this specific area. Frankly, I can't see why anyone would want to RV instead of tent it. WAY down the road a few kilometers you'll find the Quiet Campground. This one is entirely separate from everything else, and is for families who have small children or who want to actually sleep at night. The main campground area is separated not so much by which Trailhead leads to it, but by rows of trees. For example, if you're in Campground 1 and you want to get to Campground 2, then you follow a small path through a single row of trees. Trailhead 2a is not a path to Campground 2. It kinda leads between 1 and 2.
482	Assuming we're back at the entrance to Campground 1 after walking through Trailhead 1. To your direct left is the campground exit, which is basically a pathway leading to the street. If you follow this pathway to the street and cross the street, you are on your way to entering the actual festival grounds. You first go through another shaded path which leads you to festival parking. At night multicoloured lanterns light up this path and others, creating an absolutely stunning effect. Once you hit the parking area, you turn directly to your right and eventually get to the path that leads to the Handmade Village and the 5 stages. In this area you can watch tons of musical performers, buy CDs at the Folk Music Store, buy all kinds of food and drink from a variety of multicultural vendors. The Village is made up of vendors of clothing, art, jewelry, and other types of goods.
483	Again, let's assume we're back at the entrance to Campground 1 to reorient ourselves for the next description. Behind you (following the Trailhead back to its start) you'll find the most convenient parking area. You have to get here very early if you want to score one of these spots. Otherwise, you're lugging your gear at least 3K to the overflow parking area, which is not fun in 40-degree Celsius weather. Also in this area is a place you're guaranteed to see at least a few times over the weekend - the supply store. Here you can buy firewood, ice, glow sticks, matches, lighters, rope, first aid supplies. Anything you could reasonably expect to need can be purchased here. A bit beyond the store is where you would initially show your tickets and get your Folk Fest bracelet.
484	Entering Campground 1 again. As stated before, directly in front of you is Campground 1, and further to the right Campgrounds 2 and 3 which make up the bulk of the party zone. However, if you go to Campground 2 and then travel through the campground to your north, you will eventually reach Pope's Hill. It is called Pope's Hill because back in the 1980s Pope John Paul II came and delivered a speech of sorts at the top of the hill to a slew of spectators. This is a massive area downhill from the campgrounds. Once you're at the base of Pope's Hill, you're in a wide open area about the size of a football field. Surrounding this are grassy hills leading upward. Pope's Hill is where the magic happens on Saturday night. There is usually a fairly large drum circle at the top of the hill on Friday, where several hundred people go to party, but this is NOTHING compared to Saturday. Pope's Hill has changed the lives of many people, including myself.
485	Sporadically placed throughout the campgrounds are water taps and showers. These aren't organized in any way. They're just sort of randomly found as you go walking. They just stick out of the ground. The only problem is that the showers have no hot tap. It's just cold water. You would think that this is good since you're sweating bullets all day, but the water is VERY cold. Cold enough to numb you after a second or two. In fact, it's unbearably cold. People generally don't shower because of this. This suits most people fine though, the majority of the campers being dirty, filthy hippies anyway. I mean that endearingly.
486	For most of the day, the four of us stuck together, exploring the campgrounds, heading to the festival site itself to check out the Handmade Village and some of the musical acts. We didn't hang around down there for too long, partly because none of the music that was playing at the time really interested us too much, and the whole Village area was one big mud pit after last night's storm. This suited me fine, though. I was perfectly content hanging around the campsite just walking around meeting groups of people. At the beginning, I was a bit weary to leave all my stuff at my tent while we wandered, fearing it could get stolen. Dick was very quick to inform otherwise:
487	'John, I don't think you quite get it yet. You will as time goes on, but you're new to this. You're at Folk Fest. The concept of theft and robbery does not exist at this place. Look around you. There are vacant tents all around, and people's stuff just sitting there. Look over there.'
488	I looked. He was pointing to a set of three tents with apparently nobody in them. In plain sight, there was a huge bag of weed, several unopened liquor bottles, two wallets, and a very large glass bong.
489	Dick continued: 'See that? God knows how long that's been sitting there unattended. In Thunder Bay, if you saw this in someone's front yard, you couldn't walk around the block once without it going missing. But here? This is Bird's Hill Park. This is Folk Fest. There's a spirit that lives here that doesn't live in Thunder Bay. It's a spirit of respect and love. Everyone you see here is your brother or sister. Leave your shit at your tent. I PROMISE you it will still be there when you get back.'
490	Wow. I didn't know what to say. I hadn't heard Dick talk like that before, but I believed him. I looked around. People had left stuff everywhere, and nobody looked even the least bit suspicious like they were planning to steal anything. He was right. The type of attitude you get from day-to-day people in Thunder Bay didn't exist here. Everywhere you looked, people were drumming on djembes or strumming along to a classic Beatles tune as a pipe got passed around their circle.
491	'Happy Folk Fest!' Dick exclaimed to a beautiful dreadlocked girl as she walked by us.
492	'Happy Folk Fest!' she replied as she smiled and waved us the peace sign.
493	As we continued to walk around exploring, we passed several showers where people were showering completely naked, right out in the open.
494	'Oh my God! Dick! People are really free here!'
495	'Like I said, you're at Folk Fest. It's a totally different world out here.'
496	Around mid-afternoon we made our way back to our campsite. Sure enough, everything was still there. Dick rolled up another joint and Tedray brought out his two drums. I took one of them, and the two of us started to jam. Before too long, Tedray decided to get a bit of sleep before nightfall. The rest of us got a couple hours in too. We had driven all night and we'd been out in the Sun all day. We wanted to be ready for a night of craziness.
497	As the Sun was starting to drop below the horizon, we all woke up except for Tedray. We just sat in our fold-out chairs relaxing for a bit. Doing absolutely nothing can be extremely tiring under the right circumstances. Naturally, we passed around another joint. We smoke a fair amount of pot at Folk Fest. It just sorta happens. And, it's perfectly fitting with the environment you're in. As we were passing around this joint, a man around our age came by and invited himself to sit down with us. We appreciated the company and told him to take a seat. We let him finish off our joint and struck up a bit of a conversation with him. After a short while, he offered to bring over his hookah and share some shisha with us. Shisha is actually another word for 'hookah', but in this case he was referring to a brand of flavoured tobacco. He brought over this enormous hookah. By this time the Sun was nearly gone, and the sky had taken on a dark turquoise colour. I was unfamiliar with hookahs and shisha, so I asked for a bit of direction before using it. He explained about how the ember on top indirectly heats the material you're inhaling, and that you simply suck the smoke through the end of one of the hoses attached to it. He explained that what we were smoking was not necessarily psychoactive, but had a nice fruity flavour to it. Indeed it did! As we each took our turns with the shisha we each individually commented that it was berry-like, and very pleasant. The hookah made its way around the circle once or twice before Tedray woke up and joined us.
498	By this time, people were beginning to put up tiki torches around their campsites. We did the same, and we invited our new friend to come by with his own drum so we could start up a circle. And, so the night began! I borrowed one of Tedray's drums, and the two of us started up a fresh jam session. There were other drum circles you could hear in the distance, but ours sounded a bit more organized. Tedray was a seasoned hand drummer, and I have been obsessively drumming on any surface available to me since childhood. We synced up quite nicely with one another, and the transitions we made were easily followed by one another. Soon enough, a group of three people came over with their own drums and chairs, and they sat down and joined us. Then two more people. Then a few people showed up with wind instruments. Then more people. I noticed the sound getting louder around me, but I mainly focused my attention on keeping up the pace. An overwhelming smell of marijuana filled the area, and the sound got louder and louder. After maybe an hour or so I finally looked up. What I saw blew my mind. Surrounding us was a huge wall of people, dancing, drinking, drumming, howling. We were suddenly in the centre of people about 15 rows deep. There must have been 200 bodies dancing around our campsite. Minimum. I looked over at Bev, and he just nodded back in my direction. Wow! And then came Tedray's cry:
499	'EVERYBODY! WE'RE MOVING DIS SHIT TO DA FIRE PIT!!!!!!!!!!'
500	Without missing a single beat, Tedray stood up and drummed his way to the centre of the pit we'd set up our tents by. We all followed him. The circle only grew bigger. The energy was unstoppable. After another hour or so, I noticed streaks of blood on the drum I was using. My fingers were splitting open, but it didn't matter. I just kept drumming. The entourage had grown to at least 500 people by 3:00am. I finally passed the drum onto someone else, found my way to my tent, and crashed. I would have loved to stay up and keep it going, but I had barely any energy left in me to crawl out of the circle. I had never felt so alive in my life! I fell asleep to the relentless, ever-changing sound of 50 or so drums being battered all at once, the howling of hundreds of people, and the barely audible conversations of those on the outskirts of the circle. So, THIS was Folk Fest! If this was Friday, I couldn't imagine what I was in for on Saturday! Periodically throughout the night I would awaken to the ongoing sound. There was illumination on the roof of my tent. The Sun was coming back out! It was 5:00am. I unzipped my tent and looked in the direction of the fire pit. The crowd had lessened, but there were still probably 100 people or so dancing. And Tedray in the middle, unmoved from the position he was in since he got there. What a trooper :)
501	I awoke again several hours later because I was overheating in my tent. There comes a point in the day at Folk Fest where sleep is no longer an option. Not that you wouldn't LIKE to sleep, but you can't. Once that Sun crests over the treeline, your tent is no longer a tent. It's an oven. I stepped out of my tent and saw a topless lady sprawled out on the grass and a pair of black hands massaging her back. I said nothing. Neither did Bev, who had just woken up. Instead, the two of us silently took off on a walk.
502	'Oh my God, Bev. I had no idea. And tonight's going to be even better?'
503	'Oh yeah! You won't be the same guy tomorrow morning. Kiss yourself goodbye. Saturday night at Folk Fest is a reinvention.'
504	'So, what's the game plan for the rest of today?'
505	And, so off we went to find Heart and his magical brownies. But, Heart was nowhere to be found. There was no tent with a Canadian flag flying above it. At least, not in Campground 3 like we had been told. A couple shouts of 'Heart!' yielded no response. Bev and I continued walking regardless. We made our way back to our campsite in a short time and noticed that there was a lot of garbage strewn around the firepit. Dick was still asleep, and Tedray was occupied, so we grabbed a garbage bag and started cleaning up what was arguably our mess since our group had given birth to that party last night. We were joined by a couple proactive campers who we later played a bit of frisbee with.
506	Quickly, the conversation turned to mushrooms. Bev and I explained that our knight in shining armour was MIA. After a bit of deliberation, Dick and I concluded that we would go on a hunt and find some from another source. First, we would go throw all the empty bottles and cans in the recycle and dispose of any trash. And, we definitely wouldn't be embarking on a shroom hunt on an empty stomach. By this time, Tedray's mystery girl had left, so we went back to our site and started to cook up some breakfast.
507	'Wheech girl? Oh, da one I was wit dis marnin', maun? She's some baby's mudder.'
508	We ate breakfast, and discussed the mushroom situation. There were some unknowns. Who was paying for them? Were we all pitching in immediately, or were we going to square up later? How much did everyone intend to do? Were we just going to take a threshold amount, or were we going to let completely loose tonight? How were we going to find them? Would we just ask everybody at random? How could we ensure the quality of the product we were buying? We figured that we were at Folk Fest, so we might as well make this a night to remember. Dick and I would be the hunters. We would seek out 16 grams which we would split equally into 4 grams for each of us. This would ensure a pretty intense trip. If we had second thoughts about how much we wanted to do at the time of consumption, we could put some of them in tinfoil and carry them around with us in case we built up the nerve later on in the night. We would all pitch in some cash. Okay, it was decided. We knew we had to start searching soon, or else one of two things would happen: Either we would simply run out of time, or the people out there selling shrooms would run out of stock, leaving us to have a relatively uneventful Saturday night. The prospect of this happening was enough to get us moving.
509	Dick and I said our 'Happy Folk Fest's to everyone we passed and diligently asked around for where we could find some mushrooms. We circled the grounds once before we got some direction.
510	'You guys are looking for mushrooms? You wanna head to the trees separating Campgrounds 2 and 3. Go into these trees. There's about 3 tents under a big blue tarp. We picked up some there yesterday. Hopefully they've still got some left.'
511	We thanked the random shirtless man and headed to find this landmark tarp. We found it, but there was nobody there.
512	'Shit. I guess we'll have to come back later. Oh well, at least we know where to go. It's just a matter of catching them at their site.' I said.
513	'We should keep looking around though,' said Dick. 'We might find some at another site. We can't limit ourselves to just one place. If they don't show up, we're fucked.'
514	'True. We've gotta pitch in the trees next year. Look at the shade these guys have!'
515	Dick and I started to leave the site, but were stopped by a voice.
516	'Who are you guys looking for?' The voice came from inside one of the tents under the tarp!
517	'You, I think. A little bird told us we could find mush here.'
518	'Well, happy Folk Fest, gentlemen. How much are you looking for?'
519	Two minutes and one transaction later, we had our entheogenic fungus. And, they were beautiful. Dry, crisp, plentiful, blueing stems, a fair amount of shake at the bottom of the bag. This was Cubensis at its finest! Of course, for the first few minutes after returning to base we played it up as if the hunt had been unsuccessful.
520	'Sorry guys, it's a no-go on the mushrooms. We asked everyone, but nobody has any.'
521	'Well, what the fuck? It's gonna be sunset in about 4 hours. We have to get some!'
522	'We can't! Look, we've just been through the whole campground, and it's dry! I'm sorry guys, we tried. You're welcome to go looking yourself.'
523	'Well, give me my money back then and I'll go looking.'
524	'Uh, I'm afraid you can't have your money back.'
525	'Because we spent it on this beautiful bag of mushrooms!!!'
526	The mushrooms were placed in my tent, under my pillow to shelter them from the sunlight. Bev and I figured it would be a good idea to go take a shower before night hit. We did the best we could to wash up using the ice cold water from the showers. More or less, we only managed to clean our arms and legs. A hair washing was out of the question. When we got back, Dick went and had his shower. Tedray was nowhere in sight. Bev and I decided to sleep for a few hours, if possible. The night air was starting to blow across the field of neverending tents, which helped cool us down. Sleep came easily, especially with the anticipation of what was to come.
527	Nearing 11:30pm we had all reawoken and were readying ourselves for the mushroom trip. Whenever I had done mushrooms, there was always a brief period before eating them in which I got anxious. I only had about 4 mushroom trips under my belt at this point, and they had always treated me kindly. Nonetheless, despite the expectation of a good trip, and a positive attitude going into it, there were butterflies in the stomach. Nothing unmanageable. I was about to consume 4 grams of the stuff, which would be the largest quantity I'd taken to date. But, I knew that I would be experiencing something out of this world. I was positive about it. Bev had explained Saturday night to me several times before, and with great enthusiasm. But time had run out to ponder how it would be. All that was left to do was to actually eat them down and let them do their job. I joint was sparked, but I opted out of it. I didn't want to also be high on pot. I just wanted to zoom. This was my preference. I wanted a pure trip.
528	Dick opened the Ziplock bag and began to distribute the little guys equally into four piles on a paper plate. During this time, I uncorked a bottle of Merlot which we used for washing the mushrooms down. The idea was not to get drunk, or even buzzed. Small sips. Just enough to alter the taste of the mushrooms and to provide some liquid to help these dry little boys down. I poured everyone a bit of the wine. We had purchased coloured plastic wine glasses for the occasion.
529	We each took our share of the drug and placed our piles on separate plates.
530	And with that, we started on our psychoactive meal. The wine sure helped the flavour! Looking around the circle, you'd see us each scrunch up our faces in disgust and quickly take a sip to prevent gagging. For a moment, I considered bringing some of them with me, but I decided against it. All 4 grams were down the hatch within about 3 minutes. We all smiled, knowing that we were in for a journey in just a short while.
531	'You guys are pretty decent for white boys, you know dat? Even you, Dickery!' Tedray said with a loud laugh. This got us all laughing.
532	'I'm going to go grab some water before these things hit. Once we're on the hill, we're not gonna want to leave for anything,' said Bev.
533	'That sounds like a good idea. I'll come with you,' I said.
534	So, Bev and I grabbed our empty water bottles and took off into the darkness to find a water tap. As we were walking, we were passed by many people, all heading in the direction of Pope's Hill. Many of them had glow sticks either in their hands, or attached to themselves in some way or another. Some of the designs people had come up with were pretty impressive! There were people who had made themselves look like glowing skeletons, or people glowing entirely red, blue, or green. Some people were wearing flashing LEDs or chaser lights.
535	'Happy Folk Fest!' we exclaimed to everyone we passed. 'See you at the hill!'
536	We found a water tap, and there was a small line-up. The mushrooms hadn't hit yet, but I had to thank Dave for convincing me to go to Folk Fest. Someone commented:
537	'This is number 6 for me. I'll never miss a Folk Fest. You're gonna love the hill, man.'
538	We filled our bottles and headed back to the campsite to collect our friends. Dick and Tedray were both still there. Ted had started drumming, and Dick was laying back in his chair.
539	'Yeah...' he said lightly and cracked a smile.
540	We sat down for a few minutes and waited for us to each feel the onset of the shrooms. It didn't take long. I noticed my eyes beginning to water a bit. My jaw was tensing up, and I was getting the classic mushroom yawns. I looked over at Bev. He was just smiling and slowly shifting his view from one patch of nothing to the next, looking mildly perplexed. I clenched my hands into fists and released them, which felt oddly pleasant. The yawns were getting stronger.
541	'Because.....' I started, but couldn't figure out what I was trying to say. 'What did I just.....' I laughed. 'Guys! Haha! It's....'
542	The rest of them laughed. I grabbed my wine glass and finished the last sip. A little dribbled out the side of my mouth. This was hysterical!
543	Hilarious! We all laughed. The smile on my face was permanent. People were walking by our campsite, but I only saw lights. Moving lights. I shivered, though I wasn't cold. I could feel the psilocybin coursing through me, taking over. I leaned back in my chair and almost tipped it over. The light from our tiki torches allowed me to see my hands, which were breathing at me. Our energy was being drained from us.
544	'Gueeeeeuuuu.....fffffff. Happy Folk Fest!' I managed to let out. Four grams comes on strong!
545	'Alright, fuck this. Get up, get up, get up! To the hill, gentlemen!' said Bev with a burst of energy.
546	'Whaaaa, youuuuuuuu! Oh, man!' Dick tried to speak.
547	That was convincing enough. People were filing past our campsite by the hundreds. It must have been midnight. I was taking enormous, audible breaths. Each exhale was the sound of letting go. We finally managed to get up off our asses and head in the direction of Pope's Hill. Somewhere along the line, we lost Tedray. It didn't matter. He would do his own thing. That's who Tedray was. In the morning, we'd catch up with him and hear all about it. But when we approached Pope's Hill.......OH! MY! GOD! We just stood in awe. Ahead of us was somewhere in the vicinity of 7,000 to 10,000 people. At least, that's what I assumed they were. My entire field of vision was taken up by millions of glowing lights. UFOs were flying through the sky, grinning at me. Skeletons and robots made up of every colour I'd ever seen were walking and crawling along the ground. Bright neon flowers were twirling across the sky. Balls of light were tumbling down the sides of the hill. The sound was like nothing I'd ever heard before. I could hear every single person individually, but all at once. I could hear cries of joy, drumming from all directions, hollering, howling, invisible orchestras. The sky went from black to blue to green, and back to black. Behind us, the people just kept gaining in number, and they were all heading to the hill.
548	'This is so........fucking......BEAUTIFUL!!!' I muttered, just loud enough for Dick and Bev to hear. Tears fell from my eyes and I spun around. 'Guys......' I couldn't continue.
549	'Ha! Thanks Bev! I can't.......you guys.......this.......' I tried to compose myself. 'Oh, God........guys.....let's go......there......down.....down....'
550	Dick was speechless. Not a word. We ran down the hill into the enormous crowd of thousands. Everybody I looked at glowed, and they were all beautiful. I wanted to laugh and cry all at once. My body was confused all to Hell. I looked at everybody in the eye, and I felt love radiate from them. It was communication without words. Each of these people was on some sort of drug, and yet there was no fighting. Nobody spiraling out of control. Nobody having a crisis. No emergencies. No problems. No disputes. No arguing. People were hugging each other and holding each other like it was going out of style. People were laying on the grass, tripping, talking, enjoying the stars and the sky. I looked up to the sky, raised my arms, and hugged the Universe. And, it hugged me back :) This was absolute insanity! All the combined energy of everyone in this field was flowing through me, keeping me alive. Not just alive, but human.
551	The three of us sat down in the middle of a large group of people who were also sitting down. Ahead of us was a large videoscreen and a set of speakers on a stage. Before long, an odd group of three people got up on stage. They appeared to be a husband, wife, and their daughter. And, that's just what they were.
552	'Good evening everybody. I'm Jason Trachtenburg, and we are the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players. We've collected slides from various garage sales and whatnot, and we've made songs about them. We hope you like them.'
553	I wasn't sure what to think. They started up their set, complete with the various slides they had being projected onscreen. They were hilarious! The music was extremely quirky. Very safe indie art-pop type stuff. The slides were very strange. Old vacation slides from God-knows-whose-family. Corporate projections for the fiscal year, discarded in the 1980s by whatever company. Used cars and their salesmen. By far the oddest bunch of musicians I'd ever seen. They provided much laughter, but I eventually got bored of their set. Thankfully, the entertainment value of it lasted nearly to the end of their stagetime. Soon enough, they were finished. It now must have been around 2:00am. I was lost in the mushroom world. By this point, I barely felt like I was in my own body. I could move my extremities, but it didn't seem like this was a conscious choice. They did what I wanted them to, but I got the impression that I wasn't in any control of this anyway. I looked toward Bev and Dick. Bev was there, but Dick was not.
554	'Oh, okayyyyy.....' I said, my voice trailing.
555	I laid down in the grass, partly out of choice, and partly because the mushrooms were pressing my body down into the ground. I felt like I was part of the earth. An extension of it. I was one with the blades of grass. This was SO COMFORTABLE! And, then I got a treat. The Northern Lights were out, and they were dancing overhead. Not like I'd seen them before. Entire waves of colour would wash over the whole sky, mix with each other, and splash down toward me. I tried to grab them, and smiled, realizing that I couldn't. This was purely for my observation. I told Bev about it, and he laid down too. Wow! The waves started making sounds as they skidded across the sky. They rippled, as if someone had thrown a stone at them. WOW! The sounds got more pronounced, and I eventually realized that they were coming from the speakers. I sat back up. There was a man dressed in a white sheet standing on stage. Beside him was an Arab/Asian/Caribbean-looking man (I couldn't figure out his nationality), also dressed in white. And then....BOOM! A bass note so thick it could drown a fish. And another. This got Bev to sit up. The sound was so heavy, it nearly pushed me backward. The screen lit up all of Pope's Hill for a split second, and then went dark. Nothing for a few seconds.....and then another loud bass hit. Immediately following this (and in fact stemming from it) was a single atmospheric note which resonated and changed pitch. As this note droned on into the endless night, a very loud bass note ripped through us all. The screen lit up very slowly to display plumes of smoke. The smoke slowly dissipated and behind it was revealed a shamanic-looking man dressed in a long red and purple coat draped with leaves. He was blowing the smoke at the screen. He was in the middle of the rainforest. The shot turned to another one of him, this time sitting with his legs crossed on a rock near a wooden hut. He began to speak in a language unknown to probably any of us at Pope's Hill. This was subtitled. As he spoke, more single notes transformed into whispy, distant angelic sounds. He was talking about Ayahuasca, which we quickly learned was a hallucinogenic brew made from a number of distinct plants found in the rainforest where he lives. The video went on to show shots of him preparing the brew, and consuming some as he continued to blow smoke at the camera. As his speech tapered off, he faded behind the smoke and the video slowly became a kaleidoscopic entanglement of colour and shape. There was an audible sound from those of us on the hill and at the base. This video transformation, along with the formation of new slow melodic beats and droning chords took everyone by surprise. Nothing could have prepared us for this. There was no warning. And my GOD, how powerful this was under the influence of 4 very hefty grams of psilocybin! Any conversations going on in the crowd were immediately silenced by the beauty that had just been dropped on us. The voice of the shaman periodically came back in, in samples, mixed with the music. This single piece would continue on for the remainder of the set, changing just frequently enough for us all to take in all it had to offer. I looked around me to discover that I was certainly not the only one in tears. There was magic on Pope's Hill. I believe that with every bit of my heart. And then, as if my senses weren't already stimulated enough...
556	A hand crawled up my back and came to rest on my cheek. The mystery hand belonged to a mystery arm, which in turn belonged to...an angel. A beautiful angel dressed in white garments. An angel with long, flowing dirty-blonde hair and facial features that were distinct and strong. An angel I was sure I must have been hallucinating, but wasn't. We looked each other in the eye, and our souls embraced.
557	'Can I kiss you?' the angel asked rhetorically. She was not looking for a verbal response, and so we moved in for what would become the shortest, but most effective and warmest kiss I have ever - and probably will ever - experience. Mushrooms have a funny way of enhancing your senses. Your tactile sensations are somehow both completely removed from you, and greatly augmented at the same time. In fact, this is true for pretty much all the senses. They allow you to be 100% present and aware of absolutely everything around you - often to the point of believing that the world is MORE real on mushrooms than off them - but also very distant and beyond reach. This can be extremely hard to describe, but the effect of it is that you interpret everything very strongly. Thus, the kiss I shared with this anonymous angelic force on Pope's Hill in the wee hours of Sunday, July 10th, 2005 was no ordinary kiss. It was a complete and total redefinition of who I was and what I stood for. It meant the world to me, and I would have traded every single moment of every single day I'd lived for one more second of it. There was nothing more powerful, more honest, more real, more human than that brief exchange between me and....
558	'Meghan...I'm John. At least....that's who I was 4 hours ago.'
559	Meghan was with a small group of people. After we'd all met each other, one of Meghan's friends approached me.
560	'Me?' I asked. This would be embarrassing. I knew nothing about yoga. This very agile young lady would certainly make a freak show out of me if I even attempted it.
561	Well, I couldn't turn this down. She was offering a free yoga lesson. I was in the middle of a wide open field with thousands of people. Hell, I was at Folk Fest :) Sure, I'll learn some yoga! And so, for the next half hour or so I stretched the muscles in my body and contorted myself into positions I didn't think were possible. Wow! Yoga was really refreshing! I'm sure I must have looked like the biggest novice ever, but it didn't matter. I was up for anything, really. All fears and inhibitions had been sucked out of me by the mushrooms, and I was free to just BE. By this time, Maestro Ayahuasquero had finished up their set, which was a damned shame. I broke away from the group for a brief moment and spoke to the men dressed in white. I told them how amazing they'd helped the night become for me, and asked if they would be returning next year. They didn't know what their plans would be for the following year, and they in fact explained that this performance was a once-only event. Maestro Ayahuasquero was not meant to play multiple shows. They were meant to affect the lives of as many people as possible in one night and to live in the memories of those people for years to come.
562	I made my way back to Meghan, Dave, and the rest of our new group. Meghan was cold, so I offered her my white button-up shirt, which she accepted. The end of amplified music didn't stop Pope's Hill from being alive and thriving with activity. Drum circles started cropping up everywhere around us, and then I heard a voice which appeared to be coming from a megaphone speaker. It was! Somebody had brought a megaphone and was wishing everyone a happy Folk Fest through it! As he approached us, I stopped him and asked if he'd mind if I borrowed it for about 5 minutes or so. He asked what I needed it for, but seemed willing to let me use it as long as I wasn't going to kill the vibe of what was going on. I assured him that this was not a plan of mine. I wanted to do a bit of beatboxing. Little known about me is that I've been beatboxing and perfecting my own style of it since I was 6 years old. I knew I would be able to do a good job of it, and I was curious how it would sound amplified through this megaphone. I wasn't intending to make a big scene of it or anything, but I was high on mushrooms and this was something I felt I had to take advantage of. When else would an opportunity like this arise?
563	'Everybody! This guy's going to beatbox for us!' he shouted into the megaphone. Whoa, now! I wasn't expecting him to do THAT! But, I could hear people hollering and cheering for me to start. Oh, MAN! What have I got myself into, I thought! All of a sudden, a good chunk of Pope's Hill had their attention focussed in my direction and they were expecting something of a show from me. Thank you mushrooms for giving me the courage to do this! If I'd been sober, I don't know if I would have followed through. But....
564	'Alright, gimme this thing,' I said. He passed me the megaphone. I looked at the crowd of people sitting on the hill. I looked at Dave. I looked at Meghan.
565	'HELLO POPE'S HILL!!! HAPPY FOLK FEST, EVERYONE!' My voice echoed through the night. 'ALRIGHT, HERE WE GO! HOPEFULLY YOU CAN DANCE TO THIS.'
566	And for about 10 minutes I beatboxed better than I'd ever beatboxed before. I kept a good, steady pace up for everyone. I started off with a trip-hoppy loop which I gradually made louder and louder as I added different beats into the mix. I was surprised at how well some of the more throaty bass sounds projected through this thing. Once I got started though, there was no stopping me. I got into my own groove and motioned for people to get up and join in on this thing. Meghan and her group started dancing around me, which prompted more people to get up. Then, they started humming and singing along, making up lyrics to my beat. It was an enthralling experience, to say the least. I hadn't entered Pope's Hill expecting to be noticed at all, but it turned out that way in the end. Dozens of people were now dancing around me. I pointed the megaphone to the sky to get the sound out to more people. Finally, after I had done a number of preset beats I'd been working on or toying with, I shouted one last 'HAPPY FOLK FEST! THANKS FOR THE ENERGY AND THE LOVE!' and handed the megaphone back to the owner. I got a big cheer afterward which brought me to my knees. Wow! I'd just ACTUALLY done that! And it felt blissful!
567	We all got up and walked around to sit on the hill itself. The Sun was just beginning to lighten the sky off in the distance. We would grab a nice spot on the hill and watch the sunrise as the drugs started to wear off. People were so incredibly free here. I never expected I'd see couples making love right there on the grass, but it was a fairly common sight. Several groups of people had fallen asleep on the hill, while others had huddled into small groups, passing around a pipe or just reminiscing. The crowd was persistent. Nobody wanted the night to end, but we were all victims to the rotation of the Earth, and the magic had to fade at some point. Nobody on the hill that night will go to their graves forgetting what they experienced. It wasn't just me stuck in the mushroom world. Mine was but a single story in a sea of stories that night. The Sun would creep up and illuminate our glorious world, and the effects of the drugs people were on would dissipate. Water bottles were strewn across the field. Empty ziplock bags with crystalline remnants of psychoactives. Random forgotten pills. Cans. Bottles. Clothing. Most of all, memories. You could clean up the hill of all physical paraphernalia that had been left there in the heat of passion, or in the unrelenting journeys of substances running through the bodies of those present. But the memories would live forever.
568	Dave and I followed Meghan and her group back to their campsite where we consumed some Emergen-C mix in water to keep ourselves awake during the comedown. Meghan grabbed an acoustic guitar and began strumming a hypnotizing improvisation. Her voice was frail and passionate, and was thematic to the whole experience of the previous night. In time, we all hugged and said our goodbyes. We had all shared a true moment together. A moment that lasted for hours, and would resonate in our hearts for the rest of time. Bev and I began our walk back to our site. What had become of Dick? What stories did Tedray have to pass on?
569	'Haha!' A smile crossed my face and I nodded. 'Yeah. Same time next year.'
570	As it turns out, Dick had managed to find drink throughout the night. Before even eating the mushrooms, in fact. This ultimately did him in early. He was out before Trachtenburg was halfway done their set. The poor guy. As for Tedray? Well, he was nowhere to be seen in the morning hours. He had invited himself to a group of tents near Pope's Hill, had consumed quite a lot of wine, and had bloodied up a number of drums. He stumbled back to base with an empty bottle in his hand, and a girl screaming his praises as he walked away from his Saturday night hideout.
571	'I'm fookin' tired, girl! You've tapped me out, donch'know! Let a black maun sleep, God sayk!'
572	The John B.I once was died at Pope's Hill. In his place was born a new individual with a new identity and a new reason. One interested, and completely invested in the proliferation of peace and love throughout the world.

574	Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66) : General (1), Festival / Lg. Crowd (24)
575	On Halloween 2002 my friend, boyfriend and I ate an 1/8 of the shrooms. You might think between the three of us you wouldn't trip that hard but, we were so fucked up. We ate the shrooms around 4:30-5:00 and by 5:45-6:00 I was trippin' face. 
576	We were in my room trying to get ready and then I felt the effects come on. I heard my sister talking and she was walking up the stairs. I came out of my room and I started to walk down the steps when my sister and I walked past each other I remember trying to step on her.(she is 22 so it wasn't like I was gonna hurt her)I just got so angry all of the sudden and I wanted to hurt her. She just laughed and pushed me out of the way.
577	After that I went back into my room, it felt like forever until we finally left. We walked into town and went trick or treating. We were walking around for about an hour and we had basically no candy and we were just walking around in circles. We walked down this one street and noticed a light on.  We went to that house we walked up to it and there was a lady and a mentally retared guy out on the front porch. I know this sounds mean, but if I wasn't trippin' this wouldn't have happened. The mentally retared guy had the candy and the lady told him to give it to us and he wouldn't. I was hystarically laughing and I tried to control it, but I couldn't. I was the only one out of the group who didn't have on a mask, so it wasn't as bad for the other two. Then the lady started to laugh and all I could do was laugh.  Finally the guy gave us our candy and when we walked away I almost fell down the steps. We walked back to the middle of town and we saw a bunch of our friends. We started to walk with them and it felt like we were all just walking in the same spot forever. I knew where all the good houses were but, no matter how long we walked we couldn't get there. We walked past this building that has a bunch of different stores and stuff. The building had an acting theater in it and there were these two people satnding outside handing out candy. I swear the guy that was out there was on something cause when he gave us candy he just looked at us and started laughing uncontrolably. It was so scary I just wanted to run. We walked back to our friends car and then he drove us home. I laughed hystarically the whole time I tripped it was uncontrolable.
578	I'll definatley do shrooms anytime they come around. They're fun!

580	May 20th is my birthday and I wanted to hang out, ya know chill with my homiies eat some shrooms, get wasted, and just have a good night if you know what I mean. I woke up around 11:00 and got a ride to the heights around 12:00pm. After around 2:00pm I got the mushrooms and waited till aound 5:30pm and ate the shrooms with about 7 other people trippin balls!! This is my 5th time on mushrooms and the most horrorifing thing ever!I ate them on an empty stomache and drank a couple beers ya know thought I was having a good time.  Then all of a suddon it hitt me I felt like everyone hated me I was so scared of everyone I felt like I was on a rollercoaster going 100mph in every single direction, getting tossed around like a rag doll and seeing a blur of collors. Then I felt like a had to vomitt so I fell down and puked on the ground. After I looked and the shroom I threw up looked like it was growing bigger and bigger. My sister noticed I was having a bad trip so she helped me and got me a blanket to lay down on.
581	I fell alseep for prolly about 20 minutes it felt like ,and woke up and was still tripping face with my sister right there by my side.  My 2 friends I work with in woodstock met up with me and I gave the rest of the bag to them. They ate the bag and tripped face till we got back to my friends house  and we chilled up in his tree fort for for a couple hours I think?? We bought some weed and smoked about an 8th and came online to write this report! I'm starting to get tired and right now I'm just thinking about everything and everything about everything!

583	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Combinations (3), Difficult Experiences (5), Small Group (2-9) (17)
584	I was at a party with my cousins.  I hadn't taken the shrooms yet.  When I first went in, everyone was mad cool.  I was meeting a lot of people and I was with a good solid group of people I knew.  My cousins, 25, 24, 23 were experienced with the mushroom.  Only one of my cousins were tripping that night.  I chewed them all and downed them with a couple of bottles of Guiness.  I was a little drizzed, but nothing that wasn't more than social (nothing out of control).  Most of the people were on the deck smoking bowls of some fantastic crip, but I didn't have any of that.  I was too busy waiting for my trip to kick in.
585	Eventually I told myself that I was being stupid just psyching myself out, so I decided to just flow with it.  I was chilling with some people I didn't know and a few I did just talking in a living room with some soft music.  Within about a half an hour I began to feel really relaxed.  A tingling feeling began to pulse quietly through my body that made me, extremely giddy and happy, yet relaxed.  I didn't want to move.  It felt like I was putting on some kind of magic helmet and I was exploring some other world.  Everything looked the same, except for the colorful tones, and light rippling visuals.  Music was the most fantasic thing in the world to me at the time.  Bob AMrley was playing in the background and after a while, I felt like hugging everyone around me (I suppressed the urge).  Eventually I began to get really  open, and deep.  I started to be able to use some sort of extra sensory perception, and really began to notice the way people communicate through invisible means.  It was quite fascinating.  Everyone seemed to have an aura, and sometimes when I communicated with certain people, and we weren't on the same mind 'wave-length' I would get a bad vibe and it would kind of hurt me, like an insult from a good friend.  Other times I would get really good vibes from people, particularly people who were trying to help me talk about what I was experiencing.  The worst vibes came from observing people try and mess each other up with glowsticks, and also when other people that were tripping on shrooms looked like they weren't being respectful of the mushroom 'being'.  Weird.  When we finally left the party, I left feeling like I knew more about people in general and about the subtlties, we keep from each other.  
586	When in my cousin's car, we put on the system, with Bob Marley, and it was one of the greatest feelings I've ever had.  It was like a blanket, and I was being kept warm and safe by it.  I tried to keep from dwelling on something for too long, because it told me that if I didn't keep flowing I would become stagnant??!.  So I kept going into trances and then returning, only to go down another path.  
587	The only time I remember being scared by it was after my peak and everyone had already gone to sleep and I was wide awake.  I lay in bed trying to sleep, but the sound of my cousins computer tower on was bugging me out, and I kept feeling like If I didn't tell someone all the things I was feeling that I would explode, so I kept trying to suppress them and I would have some light visuals and my brain would be on a sort of stop and go.  Every time it stopped I felt anxious that it wouldn't start again.  That went on, with lots of shivering until I went to sleep.  I felt like I learned so much from that one experience.
588	The recurring feeling I felt was that it wasn't something to be messed around with, and all of the questions of the universe could never be answered but we can only better understand our place.  Also I heard from the being that those who dont use their brains, will with time lose the ability to access the being and, will thus lose the point of doing mushrooms.

590	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), First Times (2), Music Discussion (22), Various (28)
591	It was the summer of 2001. In the middle of July. I am 17 and I wanted to try mushrooms. I did not know I was getting into! Me and a few buddies were going to do mushrooms. They had already done mushrooms plenty of times and I wanted to try some with them. We were at the bus depot around 6:30. I ate 3 grams worth of dried up mushrooms, and we were just skateboarding around. After about half an hour I began feeling tired, so I sat down. I asked my friend Tyler when will I start seeing stuff. Then he pointed 2 a building in the alley way. Yhe building was about 25 meteors away and it started moving. I started laughing and then I looked @ the ground and it started rolling. Then I noticed tracers when i moved my fingers, and I was very ammused. Another half hour passed by and I started noticing I was getting all liquidy. I was wearing my green shirt @ the time, and I felt like I was a Ninja turtle. LoL. 
592	We went into the little rooms in the bus depot and I looked on the ground and it looked like green algae or some glowing material was crawling everywhere. I thought i was in a subway train because all the bulidings were moving very fast. Then I started tripping out on some green poles, the colors seperated into 2 faded green bars and turned into a cubed 3D shape. We started walking out of the bus depot and we went to a place where teenagers hang out. One of my friends came 2 c me on mushrooms first time and she was laughing her ass off. One of her friends gave me a flower and i took it, and it looked so amazing. Some green glowing material fell on my finger and i flicked it off. 
593	I stared at the moving cars, and roads ahead of me, and the streetlights looked like as if they were moving away. I got kicked out of the place because I was noticeable. Night was coming soon... and I was heading back 2 the bus depot and the orange lights which turn on when it got dark, started becoming very very bright. I did not know how 2 take the bus home so a friends relative drove me home. 
594	Instead we sat in the car for 2 hours, and i was blabbing 2 her about my life. It left like 10 minutes. She told me afterward it was 2 hours we were in the car. I was very surprised. At about 10:00pm she drove me 2 my house and then she left. 
595	I could not go in my house because my parents were awake and everything was still moving around. I walked around my neighbourhood for an 1 1/2 hours till everything slowly started 2 stop moving. When I was walking in my neighbourhood, my pants fell off, and I put them back on, but it felt like they were still on the ground. Very weird and funny. It was a clear sky and I could see so many stars and they were all wavy. I climbed on the top of the hill near our pond and thought about life, and how amazing mushrooms were. 
596	Finally before midnight I came in my house and looked at myself in the mirror. I started laughing with my dilated pupils I took my contacts off and made myself something 2 eat. 
597	The mushrooms were by almost over at 1 am. So I went into my room and just chilled there until I fell deep asleep...

600	The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
601	Me and my girlfriend were chilling one night and my phone rang. My buddy wants to sell me a 1/2 oz of mushrooms I was like sure. Than I met up with him and me and my girlfriend went back to my house. We decided to take it all 1/2 and 1/2. I ate them all not long after I starting giggling with this mad intense body buzz. 
602	I decided to put gel in my hair and do my hair. I was washing all this gel of my hands and I thought it was blood and I started freaking out.I washed it off my hands and me and my girlfriend went to smoke a bowl of the CHEEBA!. We finished the bowl and walked back from the park and I felt so tired and I wanted to sit on the couch.
603	I walked home and lied on the couch. I fell in to a coma like stage. I could hear things, but yet I couldn't respond or react to it. My girlfriend was trying to get me up and talk to me but I couldn't. She started trippin out and my mom came home. Then my body responded to things again. I was trying to talk to my girlfried but her eyes were where her mouth should be but her mouth were where her eyes should be. I got mad confused so I talked to the ceiling. 
604	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
605	We left the house and I decided to drive **really bad mistake**I could not remember where I was or what I was doing. And it was raining which made it 100 times intense. I started thinking I was in the 'stan- by eminem' music video when he was driving with his wife in the trunk. And I was like o my god, I could even hear the music (that was not actually there). So I got hungry and decided to go to mc donalds. I was so trippin out and scared cause I thought I was dyin or something that I could not eat.
606	After this I had to work in the morning so I had to go. I went home and I tripped out on the computer and it was changing screens on me and I thought it was going to explode. I looked out the window and there was a black cat, but I saw this black cat get glowing red eyes and his ears turned into horns.I yelled o my god it is the devil cat. Good thing my parents were sleeping. I than went and played the ned 'Golden eye- agent under fire' and I felt like I was actually in the game I was lookin around and looking for enemies.
607	After this trip I decided to look at my big poster of snoop dogg. O my god I thought he said something so I started having a conversation with him cause I thought he was talking. He told me he was going to front me a pound of pot **LOL**. So I talked to this poster of snoop dogg for 45 mins. Than I got tired and told him I am going to sleep he said 'aiight, catch ya lata cuz.'
608	I lied in my bed starring at the ceiling that had shadows on it. I looked at them and thought they were moving. I started thinking they were trying to come down and eat me. I was up till about three in the morning monitoring my room of 'killer shadows'. Than I passed out and still had a body buz in the morning.
609	THIS WAS MY TRIPPIEST EXPEARIANCE I HAVE EVER HAD

612	I had read about the lemon/lime tek that was supposed to potentiate the trip 8-10 fold and had decided to try it with a strain I had acquired through darknet. I decided to start low and downed only 2.5g with a glass of lemon juice. 
613	Within minutes I started to come up and did my normal routine of putting on music and lighting candles. The trip intensified so quickly that during a quick trip to the bathroom I somehow ended up on the tiled floor giggling like a lunatic. Then there was a great lapse in memory and everything I was, was no more. The infinite suffering, horror, sadness, apathy, love, awe, wonder and fear kicked in but the feelings had no positive or negative connotations. Then the last emotion struck, all on its own, loneliness. 
614	As I withered away into eternity my thoughts wandered in search of other existence. But there was only I. And with this thunderous realization I created existence in a manner reminiscent of the bibles 'let there be light!'. My consciousness was split between all life which existed as I lived each life I had created. With each birth I would forget I was god and with each death I would remember but only for the infinitesimal time between the two. In that moment of time I could choose to destroy the universe I had created and return to my whole self. Yet no matter the hardships and brutal deaths I experienced I was always reaffirmed in that brief moment of time between life and death that nothing but I was real. 
615	I spent the rest of the trip experiencing a seemingly infinite amount of lives until the trip finally ended, the universe collapsed and I was returned to my body on the tiled floor.

618	A couple of friends of mine decided to watch Charlie and the Chocolate Factory th weekend it opened.  We supposedly were 10 people who were going to split two jars.  Unfortunately two friends backed out.  Me and my friends fit in one row in the theatre.  Before the movie started, my brother, my boyfriend and I  halfed one jar (4 tablespoons each).  We weren't taking any prescriptions or anything.
619	After we ate our share of the mushrooms, I felt kinda sick and anti-social for like 15minutes. Sick because mushrooms are poison.  When the trailer started, I noticed my fingers and just how complex they looked and how cool they looked when they were moving soon after I started wiggling my toes and couldnt stop! The movie was amazing as johnny depp's face was melting and the oompaloompa songs were just so nice.  The kid willy wonka looked so fake with his braces.  I remember that we were noisy.  After the movie kids were running around the theatre, they looked like oompaloompaS!!!
620	When I left the theatre, everyone's face was melting too!! So we decided to walk home.  When I got to our village I was still seeing oompaloompas and there was a tree that looked like a massive orgy with a dead oompaloompa in it.  The mud was morphing into goats, lincoln, lion and several other faces.  I was particular about my feet being clean because it was muddy (rainy weather).  But me and one of my friends started playing and jumpng in the mud!  One of my friends was playing with the tube and funnel of a beer bong (we didn't have beer) and when someone called her phone, she stuck the funnel on her ear and the phone on the other!  Then I had to go to the bathroom, the first thing I noticed when I got inside was the tiles! It was so cute and just nice to look at... I could have got stuck there! The trip was relatively long cause we ate the shrooms at 2:40pm and I was still shroomed til about 9 and later! It was far out!

622	My first time with Mushrooms, me and my friend 'T' went camping and we decided to get an 8th of mushrooms. We ate the mushrooms at about 6:30. In about 15 minutes I started to feel the affects.
623	The very first thing that we noticed was that everything was 'different'in some way. We started thinkng up crazy things and they didnt make any scense. Since we were outside everything felt so alive, and that we were connected to nature in some way. I started to draw in my sketch book, and my pictures were very strange. My friend said that he felt curious so he put a handful of dirt in his mouth. We tripped for a good many hours when my favorite part of the trip happened my friend had handed me a piece of a tree(a branch) when for some reason it felt like a gun in my hands, and for some reason my friend started running, and I thought I was in vietnam and my friend was the enemy, and I wasnt sure if I was supposed to shoot him or not. I felt like I was in a video game! Afterwords we started to come down, and we couldnt go to sleep till about 1:30.

626	One word amazing thats what this was amazing, Never have I tripped so hard. It began at 2:30 were me and my friend who I will call R were goin to take them at his house. I took 2 fairly thin mushies with half inch caps and 3 inch stems and another half stem. I ground them up and let them sit in lemon juice for 10 min. I fasted for 16 hours beforehand. 
627	10 min into it I started to feel it and something tells me in the back of my head 20 min later 'wow I'm tripping pretty hard'. I proceded to pick up a home made 'wand' and began to play with the surounding hallucinations (which were light at the time) then I started to see 3 images of the wand as I held it. I thought it was my contacts but as I rubbed my eyes I noticed this was the mushrooms. I looked at the wall where R's grow light was shining on next to his marijuaan plant (both filled the room with an intense comforting feeling) we proceded out to the living room and I look at the couch arm (about 45 min into the trip) and start to see this mayan like teal green drawing start to kalidescope around a black space were I saw a bearded man (jeasus?) and a tall mountain. 
628	During this time my other frined K was playing the stariway to heaven backwards on an acoustic guitar. I was amazed and humbled by the site. It was too cold to go out side (which was not good because if I start to get trip anxiety I like to go outside) so we stayed in. We went into R's room again, I looked at the ceailing and I saw it covered in intensly colored pink, baby blue, white, and black paisly. It pulsated and wouldnt go away even if I tried. Among all this were what seemed to be eyes in front of my face that would follow  if I turned my head. If I closed my eyes I would see colors kelidescoping out of control too intricate to comprehend.
629	Then slowly the trip faded away leaving me with an imense sense of knowledge and knowing. I feel enlitend to the secrets of the universe only the dosed can comprehend.

632	I have found the true meaning of god within this trip.
633	It was the summer of 02 leading on to another stage of my high school years, this journey took place particularly early. A friend  decided to watch over me and put in a video of awe 'Fantasia.' This would begin my trip and soon we both decided a change of scenery was needed.
634	We decided to go to a neighborhood friends house.  This is where my trip really began, I started to watch the cabinets melt into the floor, I saw 'dazed and confused' over and over on the TV screen, ghosts were on the wall and I could not tell whether I was hot or cold.  These were potent mushrooms indeed and I knew my best bet was to lie down somewhere and enjoy the day.  
635	After this intense experience I knew god was found within each and every one of us as a voice that lets us know right from wrong.  It is our own personal devils advocate.

638	Last night was my first night of trying Hallucinogenic Mushrooms. I took about 1/8 of Cubensis Mushrooms and I was having a good old time.
639	At first the city of Seattle seemed like cardboard cutouts, this was after about 15 minutes after ingestion of said shrooms.
640	Then everything went all Sepia colored and I felt so good. As we were walking around the Center House I found it hard to comprehend the fact that I was in Seattle and I still felt like I was sitting in the car and I felt amazing and happy. When we saw the space needle I saw it as a giant cardboard cut out that looked like a mushroom.
641	Then the Laser Show started, it was Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon, and it was beautiful. I still cannot tell whether or not the laser show was 4 hours, for half and hour long.
642	I got stuck in this emotional rut during the show, I felt as if I really never want to do this again, then I also felt at the same time that I was so happy, I switched in and out of these moods quickly and rapidly, and I just kept trying to stay in the happy zone.
643	After the show the visual effects had worn off and I had the giggly part left over, and I just kept laughing and laughing.
644	Today I find myself thinking in the way that I was talking last night, which is ok.
645	I just have this overwhelming feeling that everything is going to be ok and I like it very much. I'm happy and content with life right now.

648	The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
649	It all started with me not having done psychedelics in awhile and wanting to do them again. I missed the feeling of reality and wanted to feel it again. I was at work and my co-worker told me about having done shrooms recently and had got them from a guy who I know to get weed from. I bought a whole quarter (7 grams dried) which ended up to be 7.3g total and I planned on doing it on the weekend.  At work today though I had someone crash into my parked car and so I went home and made a claim for it and thought it was early in the day so I thought to myself. What time other than now is a good time to do these shrooms.
650	I ate them at 1:15pm and started watching the office on netflix and right away had the feeling of uh oh and that reality was about to hit me at full swing. At about 1:45 I started to feel the effects full tilt and started getting the full body feeling of panic that wasnt like anything else I have ever experienced before and at about 2 I was blacked out with intense visuals laying on my bed and for the next 4 hours I was stuck helpless on my bed and it made me really have the feeling of all our efforts, like all the effort I can possibly ever put into anything is useless without any creative input. I can waste my life working hard which is fine, I will turn out to be respected equally as my high school janitor. But if I wanna help issues I need to find out exactly why problems happen and how to solve them at the source, which isnt easy and that is the point but analyze what is happening around me and find out what effects it big or small and really think about it to myself and say what idiot is too small to realize that solving your problem is so easy and fix it myself. Then I will find personal success that comes along with it. A janitor does this job well but expand on it and I am sure nothing less than success will be right there for me. It was very intense and didnt end until 5:45 when I awoke and felt destroyed inside and out but with some type of weird accomplishment.

652	I was with my about 5 of my friends who were all planing on taking mushrooms together. We were all at our friends house and we took the mushrooms at about 10:00. I took an eighth, and the rest of everyone else about the same. About a half hour after eating them, I could feel the effects slowly come on. But by this time everyone else had already started to see some visuals. I hadn't yet. Out of nowhere everyone got really wierd vibes, and started to act wierd and leave to other rooms. So I was left with my friend Nny. We wanted to go on a walk, no one else did so we left. As soon as we walked out the door, I started to shroom harder immediately. We walked down the street deciding on where to walk to at 11:00 at night. All the cars passing by were so bright, I could hardly see. But everything else I saw was so intensely different, and just looked wierd and different from normal. We ended up walking to my apartment to hangout outside by a little lake thingy outside. 
653	I must say that when I am shrooming, I must be in a place with nature. Otherwise I feel out of place and left alone. So we walked down to the little lake. And began our adventure there. We stared at the water for what seemed like forever. Just watching the ripples, and ducks. Listening to all the noises of the night. Loving every single aspect of all living things. We stayed by the lake for nearly 2 or 3 hours. We peaked there at about 1:30 or 2. Peaking on mushrooms is sooooooo amazing. I felt like I was in my own little part of heaven. Just enjoying every single second. 
654	We moved on sown the street to find ourselves at the grocery store. What a trip. 'Imagine a huge building dedicated to serving you and every single one of your needs. Wall to wall food. Imagine that. '  Well, it's funner to try and understand such an amazing thing as that that night. We walked around all night just having one of the most amazing adventures ever in our lives.
655	While this is all going on, my best friend Tori was shrooming balls alone at home in her room (good trip), and our other friends are at thier apt sleepless, scared, and just plain old f'd up (bad trip)!!!
656	Anyway, so we walked back to the lake to come down, and try to get tired. Once rest was wanted, we wlaked back to my place at around 5 in the morning. I had to go to the work in the morning at 11. But I still had a great day to follow my trip. 
657	All I have to say is that was one hell of a trip.

660	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
661	Three friends and I took a trip to the Grand Canyon.  We had under a half ounce of shrooms and quite alot of cannabis.  We were constantly getting stoned during the car ride, and while on our way to the Canyon we split up the shrooms between the four of us.  It was quite intense.  As with all of my psychedelic experiences, I believe the sight changed my life.  The masses of land and hills seemed to bob around and move, as if they were purposely trying to mesmerize me.  I'm somewhat disappointed in some of my sober friends, however, because I'm sure I was acting like a lunatic by getting so close to the edge of the cliffs.  It felt like the Canyon wanted to suck me in.  *note, I should always have a sitter when experimenting with shrooms.
662	By far, the most interesting part of this experience was the car ride home.  We split what was left of the shrooms (approx 3 grams) and hit the road.  I wasn't entirely comfortable with a tripper driving, but to be honest he proved to be perfectly capable.  There was lightning, amazing sights, and about 1/4th an ounce of weed passed between the four of us.  
663	Halfway home we pulled up to a Pizza Hut.  At this point we were all realizing how incredibly strange everything was... There was no longer a sense of 'gee everything is so pretty,' rather sub-lingual communication between the four of us was getting constrewed (in other words, we were peaking for sure).  The waitress (a waitress at Pizza Hut??) must've thought us to be absolutely insane because we could barely manage a sentence, plus our pupils must've been incredibly dialated.  Besides freaking the waitress out, the Pizza Hut experience was very metaphysical.  One of my companions finally managed to spurt out a well-articulated order with specific instructions on how to cook the crusts w/ cheese... He really suprised me.
664	Anyway, maybe an hour later down the road we all started laughing uncontrollably.  I love that feeling.  Just thought I'd throw that in.
665	It was really an awesome experience, and I'm especially suprised at the potency of such a small dose of shrooms.

668	The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
669	It started off with me being at a friends house, eating my 9 gram bag of mushrooms. We had bought some weed earlier, we smoked 14 bowls and the mushrroms began to kick,and my 40 ouncer of old english shows up. I saw the world like I've never seen before, halucinating like a freak, the fish in the fish tank was scared of me, people appeared to be melting, a good friend shows up with some more of the mushrooms. I was offered a gram, I accepted, so I grabbed the biggest bluest stem in the bag. From there on the party was a blur, complete blur. From what I've heard, I started off by throwing up into my hands and threw the puke on the wall, then I puked all over myself. As my friends rushed me to the drive way to finish hurling, as I sat rocked out of my head, friend asked me to stand up, I declined then she kept at it, so I turned to her and chomped on her leg, I almost took a chunck out of her leg, and I left a big blue bruise with red teeth marks around the outside. Since I was so messed and I couldn't walk another 'friend' of mine decides to call my parents to come and pick me up from the party, a couple people told my parents that I was just drinking so my parents took me to the hospital to get my stomach pumped. I told them as I was the the hospital door that I ate mushrooms, they didnt take me in because they didnt want to get my friends in trouble for providing the mushrooms. When we arrive home they laid me on the couch, the only thing I remember is the snap of a finger, my fathers finger, I laid there thinking it was all a dream, being in my house and all with my parents, then I found out its all really happening to me, I wanted to know who called them and I wanted to know what the fuck happened that night, all I know is that was the most amazing I've felt but it was not worth it, wait.......... Yeah it was.

672	It was early June, my cousin and I had just been granted a view into nature.  We setup camp in our lovely mountain canyon and began eating. (with the assistance of Subway sandwiches....making sure I put them directly into the juicy parts of the sandwich, let sit for 5 mins( to get rid of the crunchyness))
673	Anywho, after a while of starring at our fire we realized there was something magical about it today, but we weren't quit unsure of what exactly, only that it was fun to look at. I remember standing up and I told my good cousin 'B' that 'I think I want to walk around.'
674	From there it was all somewhat of a blurr.  As I remember coming up higher, we wandered through our canyon/forestry and slowly we were becoming more and more connected with all the plants and natural surroundings, at one point I said  'B, I feel like we are man-animals.'  He naturally agreed with this, seeing as we were wondering about the forest, and we both had the idea that there was something great coming up beyond our sight of the forest path, and as I think back, I realize that the whole thing was an enjoyable experience.
675	At one point I looked up into the clouds and pointed out a cloud which closely resembled a skull to the both of us.
676	After joyously wondering around the canyon/forest for about 5 hours, we finally sat down to stare at our camp fire again, at this we were returning to reality.  I didn't have any visual effects with this breed of mushroom, but the night was purely magical to say the least.
677	I cannot emphasize just how close we both felt to nature that day, so close we realized that we were/are indeed a part of our Earth.
678	NOTE: Ive been reading over various trips online and I have seen a few fools who have been tripping and driving at the same time.  First of all, people who do this aren't doing a very good job at being safe, second, people who drive tripping don't give us safe/wise trippers a chance in the general stereotyping eye of the general public.

681	My boyfriend and I decided to try mushrooms. Neither of us had done them before and went over to our friend's house. He had done them before and was nervous to do them again because he said that he felt 'fear and loathing' while on them. We got comfortable watching TV and took the mushrooms little by little. I had been warned beforehand that many people made the mistake of taking too much and didn't realize it until it was too late and they were in the middle of a bad trip. We just relaxed and let the mushrooms sink in. I started to feel a little nausea after about 45 minutes so I had some chips and that took the nausea away. We smoked some pot to take the edge off and then just relaxed as the mushrooms took effect. I'd say it took about an hour before they really kicked in. I don't know for how long they were at their peak, because I was really in my head. I had a weird experience where I started questioning reality. I really had myself convinced that I had made up my family, friends, and life. I found myself obsessing over this thought during the duration of the trip. I also had weird paranoia that my boyfriend and his friend were talking about me. After awhile I came down and was able to function again. Even though my thoughts during my trip had been spooky and weird, I knew that I never would have thought that way without mushrooms. Coming down from them was easy and quick and my thoughts about my reality being all in my head seemed silly. All in all, the experience was good but I would do it next time probably in nature.

684	I happenned to be in the happy circumstance of obtaining some mushroom growing kits, completely legally, and which required some input from myself to bring them to fruition.
685	I'm not sure about the legal status of these kits anywhere other than where I am but it seems to be that you can get them, grow them and eat them, but if you prepare them for consumption (i.e. dry, cook etc) then they become illegal. I've effectively countered this (I think) by having them growing inside my room and eating them as I feel.
686	I'm not quite sure what type though. The growth seems to be a shroom which ends up about 10cm high with a small top (this is when it spores), and a fringe about 1-2cm below the cap. The stalk varies but is at least half a cm in diameter varying to 'Grand Dady' which was 1.25 or a bit less. Light brown cap, high humidity, some sun.
687	I've had a few packs to consume and have found that taking too many at once, and especially too many at once over a short period of time diminishes the experience totally. Three or four of the finer ones works very well, and the thing is I can pick them the next day.
688	Every time I take the dose I've learned to be right for me I have an awesome visual and 'deep' experience, not just the carpets or the curtains spinning but a real folding into what others are talking about, and an ability to understand them despite my own inbuilt prejudices. 
689	A hit of THC with this maybe too much, and THC and something on my taste-buds like Red wine makes me very thirsty for cool, clear water.

692	Hello there, my name is bobby and I wanted to write today about a recent mushroom experience I had. My friend and I waited until about 10:00 one night and ate the exact some amount (2.0gs) on full stomach, and chased them down with orange juice (we heard vitamin C enhances experience). We watched television until about one hour in when we looked at each other and new it had begun. Now the key to the whole experience is what we did next, my friend had a 60 inch television and we put sunrise earth (nature show with breath taking scenery) on and muted it.  Then we began to discuss the situation from the inside out, we are 2 likeminded individuals which may have played a big role, but we began to discuss why we were here and what we were doing. We both stared at the muted screen for hours finishing each others sentences and discussing some of the most intense teenage philosophy and world views, the air around us seemed full of such life and it was like we were grabbing answers to lifes most important questions out of each others heads. Anyway as soon as he accidentally turned the TV off it was like I was brought back down from a plateau and returned to the couch I was sitting on. I doubt we will ever be able to reach that kind of consciousness ever again. All I can do is thank the mushrooms.

695	My two experiences smoking mushrooms have gone like this, the 1st time was at a house party, myself being drunk and high (mota) ambled into a room with 3 people smoking out of a water pipe.  I was informed it was mushrooms and inhaled a a time or three.  Honestly I can't remember how many, but it was a good sized bowl, probably about 2 grams or so in it.  The effect:  I went into the room fucked up and walked out stone sober.  I hung around the party for about another hour, got bored and went home.  I'm not sure if that was normal, but hitting that pipe completely zeroed me out.
696	#2 was about a month ago and I had about a gram left over after a fun night.  I only take mushrooms maybe 3 or 4 times a year, and eating two grams of these had me flying for about 8 hours.  That was on Saturday, Wednesday I found the remnant sac in my pocket (needed to do laundry), it was almost exactly one gram, which we smoked out of a schwag (mota) pipe, it took 4 bowls to smoke all of it, and it smoked SLOW, but in the end it was.....nothing, for either one of us, it may have not been enough but it was a pain in the ass to smoke that many bowls and get nothing, not even the tinglings of a rush or anything.  In my opinion, If I want to enjoy shrooms, I eat the mf'ers.

699	On my 17th birthday I went to my good friends house and he delivered on his promise and had some mushrooms for me as a gift(as well as for a friend of his, whos birthday was close to mine and he had the same deal). I was curious about them since pot was starting to be the same-old same-old and mushrooms were a distinctly new, natural psychedelic.
700	I started light put 2 caps and a few stems on a pizza and we walked down to the private lake in his neighborhood. Same amount as everybody else.
701	Just waiting for them to kick in ,watching the night sky reflecting on the lake.
702	I think their starting to kick in maybewait no. so we go back to his house and to finish the bag.
703	He gives me another cap and stem. About 15 minutes latter Im starting to feel funny. 
704	It was my minds ear was hearing the echo of my higher vibration. The vibrations of space. Of reality .of time.
705	I started to hum to play with the sounds a bit. I could feel the vibrations illuminate my whole body. I was grinning.
706	I dont know man I dont want you to have a bad trip.
707	Starts to feel like Im standing on the highest peak of the world, with the sun sending rays of energy to me. Im traveling at the speed of reality. Im everywhere I want to be.
708	In everyway Ive always wanted. Its all choice. (But I cant really articulate that feeling, only experience it.)
709	I come down form that feeling great after glow and goto sleep.

712	I did 4 grams of mushrooms alone one night. I was drawing in my sketch book, when I got an erge to medetate. 
713	I was always scared about metetation on drugs, incase I lost contorl. But I felt that I could do it. 
714	I got into a pretty deep state of peace. Everything was going well. But all of a sudden it felt like I had been sucked back into my body. And all the air was sucked out of me. And it wasn't cause I forgot to breath.
715	So I had to gasp for air for about a minute. Then I started to focus on my room, and I saw something standing by my closet. It was a tall figure in a black cloke. I just stared at it for a few minutes. And it was verry still.
716	But then it reached up, grabed a silver bracelet from my ex boyfriend that was on my top shelf. And threw it on the floor. I got really scared and left my room. I sat and thought that it couldn't have thrown something at me, it wasn't real. So I went back to my room, and it was still there. I sat on my bed facing it. It turned and looked at me. I saw it was a white floopy-eared rabbit. With a strange grin, and a star 'tatooed' on his left eye. It just looked at me. I got really scared again, and left my room. And din't go back. 
717	In the morning, I found my bracelet that I thought he had throwen, on the floor. Now the white rabbit comes into my dreams, and just sits there, staring at me. But I am no longer afraid of him.

720	My friends and I decided to take shrooms a while back for some real visual experience because weed only does so much.  We decided to get 3/8's of a oz to split between the 3 of us.  I found out it takes a bit for them to take effect.
721	To pass the time we decided to play some Bond on the PS2.  All was going well in the game until one of my friends quit playing and just sat there.  Our characters had become completely unplayable due to the visual disability we had, none of us knew how long we had just been siting there not playing but I would say 10 mins.
722	We all got up to discuss what was going on with how we felt and everything.  We all felt really weak as if we were very old and completely unable to do easy task like move chairs, a remote control, pick up shoes.  Unanswerable questions began running through my head that could never be answered.
723	Just when I thought I might have a bad trip someone said something that was sort of funny and we all began to laugh.  It continued on and on. 20mins or so of straight laughing might have occured (not sure, time gets distorted).  Then, those laughs you get because you can't breath and you make that squeek noise happened.  That would continue the laughing.  It happened so long that I was like 'I can't stop laughing, I'm going to die like this' MY friends nodded and a couple minutes they subsided a bit.  At any moment though they would start back up and we would spend minutes laughing about nothing.  Then the night became blurry and unrememberable.

726	The night started off with me and 2 of my friends eating some chocolate fortified mushroom each with 3.5g of psilocybian. We went outside to look at the moon and the stars since it was night and the sky was clear. Everything in nature looked amazing. Trees without leaves seemed to be cathedral-like. The stars seemed to vibrant. Everything looked so much more beautiful than it really was. However, after our drunk 'mental' babysitter (to aid in our mental sanity) became too cold to remain outside, she entered my residence and began to play very loud mainstream poppy punk music. This disturbed the peace and we all started questioning existence from then on. The 'truth' was pointed out through some controversial discussion. While completely avoiding religious beliefs, we began to question existence itslf and what mattered. We all came to the conclusion that life is a giant waste of time and in order to pass the time, it is filled with diversions such as eating, sleeping, etc. We all came to the conclusion that life is a giant waste of time and in order to pass the time, it is filled with diversions such as eating, sleeping, etc. Anything to delay the inevitable mass extinction of many species on earth (including humans) due to humans. Obviously this wasn't a good thought, and we all started becoming depressed and apathetic about life. 
727	Quotes: Meaning in and of itself is meaningless
728	        Life is just a giant set of diversions
729	With this trip in mind, I will say that I have had past bad experiences with marijuana due to extreme paranoia.
730	Synopsis: Weed sucks. Shrooms are cool, and then suck.

733	Dose was prepared by steeping the mushrooms in water for about 30 minutes, pouring the water into cups, then adding honey.  This is my favorite way to ingest them, because I don't really taste the shrooms.  Each cup was estimated to have 1/16 oz.; I didn't even finish my cup and I still had a good trip. 
734	Effects started faster than usual, after about 15 minutes I started noticing 'life' popping up everywhere.  The christmas ornaments started looking at me, some evil, some good.  I went outside and noticed they trees.  They 'told' me the only way they could talk/move was through wind.  I noticed some 'gnomes' (about the size of garden gnomes) that were hidden in the bark of a neighbor's tree. Each blade of grass was alive, beaming as the sun beat off them.  In the foreground of a sunset, a leaf spiraled to the ground, and I realized that life abounds in everything, from the macro to the micro.  Even the birds that were painted on the thermostat were alive.  This energy/lifeforce told me that all you had to do was notice it and smile back.
735	This trip was the realization of a quote from the St. Thomas gospel: 'I am the light that is over all things....Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.'  It was beautiful.

738	After a long and upsetting attempt at growing my own mushrooms via PF tek I decided to try my new cubensis little smurfs. It was my first time expiriencing a drug other than cannabis and at the advice of my brother I tried them out with him in his apartment. 
739	The appearance of my mushrooms frightened me slightly as they were in all likelihood moldy-having little white wispy hairs stemming out the bottom of most to all my specimen. We hadn't dried them up yet and decided to eat them regardless.
740	Worrying that the potency would be deminished if we ate our vodka rigitoni first we ate after ingesting my new friends. Within about 20 minutes each of us had eaten about half of our meals when the wood work on all his cabinets started to appear as if they were melting of the hinges. Upon inspection my brother correctly guessed I was 'feeling it' and even that I saw melting wood. We both enjoyed a good laugh at that for while and decided to continue eating only to find out that this was an increasingly difficult activity. Something like 10 minutes later I felt so incredibly cold and sat down on the couch. My brother still enthralled by the faint hallucinations found his way to where I was and informed me that I was completely flushed and my face pale white. As soon as I heard that nausea swept over me. I had a nice (for me) vomitting followed by a nice sense of comfort but my face was still pale. Enjoying the comforting feeling I noticed the visuals were virtually gone so me and my brother just sat talking until 5 in the morning when we FINALLY felt tired.
741	I would have to say that this expirience WAS rewarding and it made me understand the appeal of magic mushrooms. I've had more expiriences since then from the same batch but didn't feel the same. I've since discovered the batch I grew was pretty weak (according to my brother).

743	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), First Times (2), Personal Preparation (45), Small Group (2-9) (17)
744	Taken on an empty stomach in a group setting of five people, four men and one woman.  Only three of us ate mushrooms and subsequently began to burp.  The one guy and his girlfriend did not eat any. so the guy started annoying us to get some weed.  Which was enough that we walked to the park to smoke. Dark outside as we get to the park, and we are all burping.
745	I am feeling internal struggle wanting to keep the peace while wanting to abandon the group.  The two other trippers are also feeling this disturbance and I am beginning to trip.
746	Visual reality is pluralized, one layer moving and one stationary, overlapping so that I can also see bright lights shining through the visual field.
747	I threaten to push somebody into the pond.  It made sense at the time because  he threw an empty water bottle at me.
748	Two people are smoking pot but other dude with lighter is off in the bushes.
749	I decide very quickly and without warning to get on my bike and abandon the trippers without saying goodbye.  I ride off very quickly until I am at an arbitrary spot with no notion of how far I've come other than that it is probably more than a mile.  I try to read a street sign, it isn't telling me anything. I lock my bike to a pole so I can walk around.
750	Totally lost, I finally realize that I can walk uphill and will without a doubt I will arrive at the top of a certain mountain.
751	I do this until I end up on a winding road.  Cars going by agitate me.
752	I walk up this road until I am in complete darkness.
753	-'If you want to survive this pay close attention'-
754	I run and run and run until I am exhausted enough to fall down.
755	I see a light up ahead.  It is a car.  It is a cop car.  I jump up and the cop car disappears.  I see a streetlight in front of me and a bench. I sit down and after a while a dog, all white, runs up to me.
756	The dog has no collar and starts growling at me.  I growl back at the dog and it looks very sad and whimpers.  The dog ran away.
757	I want to go bathe in the pond but it will be cold.  I walk a little ways up the path off the road and I see an owl directly in front of me, so motionless I didn't see it at first.
758	Staring across from where I am to distant hills beyond the city I feel confused as to where I am sitting, on those hills or in the woods on this mountain?  
759	Standing, I stretch and feel my bones lengthening, skin healing and scars falling away.
760	Streets off in the distance look like space ships with rows of lights.  The sun comes up and I go look for my bike.

762	It was my 2 best friends and me. We planned on this night for a while.
763	It wasnt so much as a plan as much as it was just to eat some mushrooms and trip our balls off all night.
764	My friends and I ate about 6 grams each we had 16 grams at the begining of the night and woke up to none.
765	We ate them around 9 at night and within 20 minutes I was tripping pretty hard. I would look around the room, my friends faces look like plastic, we all looked like dolls. The walls we shifting around, the paint was dripping. The walls were bubbling out and the rug looked like was crawling up my legs. I was in complete aw that this was possible. My whole body looked like it was changing shapes, and colors
766	We decided to go out side, it seemed like a total different world. The trees looked as if they were aging years in seconds.
767	They would get taller and taller. My cell phone goes off I really dont know hwo it was but they had an extremely wierd voice. Or at least at the time it was trippin me out.
768	All night I couldnt stop laughing so hard.EVERYTING was just insane and comical. Were just chillin in his room all confused.
769	The door opens and I'm sitting on the ground staring at wierd looking bug. And were all cracking up being really loud.
770	My friends dad comes in and hes changing shape and looks just as trippy and fucked up as we do. He look liked clay. So fake looking.The convorsation goes well with his dad. 
771	Its now about 1:00 in hte morning. I'm starting to trip extremely hard. Being so overwhelmed with things to look at. Things to think of.
772	All I wanted was some tree. We finally picked up bomb tree and smoked all night long while triping balls.
773	I didnt get high at all. Just more fucked up in generall.
774	My whole vision looked like graph paper. Clear transparent lines making a perfect grid. Anywhere I went, my whole world was in a vortex. My trip slowly wore off and after felt just really dumb. My brain and me had quite a night.

778	Group of 4. Two couples. We rented a cabin in the woods for a weekend. Arrived in the afternoon and set up the cabin for our journey. Had dinner, cleaned up a bit, then ate our dosage (3.5 for the girls, and 8 grams for the guys). We sat in the living room on the floor as our playlist played in the background, bouncing a ball on to each other during the come up. After about 30 minutes we could feel the effects kicking in,. We all agreed it was coming in much quicker than our group trip a couple months ago. After about another 45 minutes one of the girls got sick in the kitchen. She seemed to be ok, no big mess. We helped clean up and reassured her that it happens sometimes. Everything was going great then I lost my phone which was controlling the music. I was agitated but at this point didn't have it in me to go on a search. The music was still playing but I had no control over it. Then I lost my weed. Again no biggie I thought. Then while some mellow piano tune was playing my visions went to death and violence. I wasn't worried I would act on any of these. I loved everyone I was with. I was more worried I was looking at who I really was. Coinciding with these visions was a skyrocketing body temperature and what felt like heartburn. Eventually the visions faded and the trip was fun again. I guess I'm wondering if anyone has felt the same before? Was it the loss of the music and green? Or the feeling of my body? Or something dark inside of me?

781	A friend sold me about $10 worth of Psilocybe Cyanescens. Since it was my first time he warned me not to do it at school, but I was too eager to trip. I chewed the caps thoroughly and washed them down with Mountain Dew. 
782	About 20 minutes later I started to feel a little bit of a body high, everything started to look a little different, and everything seemed a little but funnier. My friends kept fucking with me, but it was still fun. I closed my eyes and saw flowing pulsating patterns of blue and red lights. I walked around a little with my friends as the trip started to come on, and eventually I wandered off by myself to smoke cigarettes in the woods. My REAL trip began there. 
783	Everything looked so amazing. The sound of the rain drove my thoughts as I stood in awe of everything. One thought echoed in my mind, 'everything is expanding in and of itself'. I'm not really sure what that means or how it applied to my trip, because everything just looked so in place and perfect. Intensly harmonious.
784	I thought about the absurdity of everything and realized many things about humanity. I realized that 'the system' is our culture. We're all just fucking with each other, we can't get along and trust each other, we can't let each other know that we are really all the same and all feel the same way because we're afraid, and so we've created this horrible, inhuman, cold 'system'. It's our culture. I thought alot about this, and thought about what it would be like to live in some African village. I wandered around for awhile, and stumbled across a HUGE patch of some unidentified mushrooms. I picked one and put it in a bag of pot. 
785	I wandered back to school, and to make a long story short ended up in the principals office with my bag of pot and shrooms on the table. My mom was coming to pick me up. The principal left the room, and I grabbed my shit and ran. I came into contact with my mom soon after getting away from the school, and she drove me home. They suspended me for 10 days, but atleast they didn't get to turn my shit over to the cops.

788	At 12:00 midnight, J and I ate about 2 grams of shrooms each and then proceeded to smoke 3 one-gram joints. We figured it would only take us a few hours to peak and come down completely. When it got to be 1:00 or so and we'd merely gotten high, we became discouraged and started second guessing dosage and the quality of the shrooms. At about 1:30 we became a bit light headed and colors started looking vibrant. By 2:00 we were tripping our asses off. Here are a few things that stood out:
789	1. Something strange happens to the way I perceive parallel or somewhat parallel lines. We could see ripples flowing through the drawn blinds in my apartment.
790	2. The way TV is colorized gets REALLY warped, something about the way that the tiny sets of red, yellow and blue lines in the screen are set up gets distorted badly when I trip. Actual faces on live people look the best, they 'morph' and convolute and it's hysterical.
791	3. Wood grain looks strange, parts of my wood door looked like they were sticking out from the 2D surface.
792	The trip lasted until 7am and we were laughing like idiots the entire time. Shrooms are da bomb!

795	Everything started to feel different, peoples faces started looking ellongated and warped.
796	I felt as if I could see into people's inner souls. I could tell deep down whether they were fake, real, bad ,or good. I tripped with a few buddies. They felt the same
797	We all talked and agreed on a lot of theories.
798	I felt like I knew allll of the answers in the world
799	The meaning of life itself, our intentions, karma, and somewhat our creator.
800	I have to agree to say it was a life changing expierence, I felt in somewhat of a transcending reality, that would change without my realization
801	The visual effects were the vibrant variety of colors swirling mystical orange in the sky with a black background. The trees looked and sounded as if they could whisper something to my subconscious mind.
802	I felt as if I was linked with my soul, and had true universal understanding....

806	It was the first night of bonnaroo 2004 with dave mathews shitty set an umphreys show comming up.  It was about 8:45 and I decided that smoking pot and eating ganja goo balls wasen't enough for my anticipated umphreys show so I decided to pick up some chronic mushrooms.  I placed the boomers in a ham and cheese sandwitch and munched it down.  Now I am an extreemly expirence mushroom eater going through both good and bad trips and getting through them.
807	As we got to my friends tent I realized that I needed water and could not lay off the fact asking everyone and anyone for it.  I finally got my water but still had my anzioty so I decided to lay down in the grass and look at the stars.  At this point in time is when the effects really started to kick in.  My body started to feel like the grass was growing all over me and then turned into arms which pulled me under ground only to shoot me straight back up into the air and back to reality.  I then knew this was going to be like no other trip.
808	As I snaped out of it I went back to the tent to see when we were going to begin out journey to umphreys but as soon as I looked at my friends all of there facial expressions changed sporadically so I had no idea who was mad or happy or anything. as I looked at my friends all of there facial expressions changed sporadically so I had no idea who was mad or happy or anything. 
809	We began to journey to the umph show and the waves began to kick in hard core.  Every wave began with me running as fast as I could tward the light till I fell to the ground just to get pulled under.  Now I am not a religious person at all but the way that I got pulled under ground greatly resembled jesus on the cross pose with my hands out to the sides and my feet nailed to eachother.  The most intense part was everytime a wave started I felt like more and more of my actual reality and past was forgotten.  It started simple like me thinking I was a different person to me not believing who I really was.  At one point I woke up from a 'coma' only to realize my whole life was a compleete dream and that I was someone else from the 60's who had just gotten out of a bad acid trip.
810	The only thing I can actually remember from reality is running aroung naked and being extreemly agressive with people who were trying to help me.  I am happy live every day as it comes type of person and am not mean to practally anyone.  My trip kept going untill the sun came up the next morning to which I smoked a bowl and said 'what the fuck just happened' and went on with the rest of my weekend.  Though I stayed away form mushies and went with happier drugs like mali and x.

813	I picked up a 1/8 of shrooms from a guy and me and my friend immediately consumed them. I have tryed mushrooms before, but in a much smaller dose. At first I felt a little sick, but it quickly turned to mild euphoria. Then I went and sat down and began watching tv. I didn't really notice it until it felt like my whole body was growing roots and I was becoming anchored to the chair. I couldn't move for a while, but then my finger twitched and the rest of me was able to move around. Anytime I stoped moving my body would again become paralyzed until some external event forced me to move. So I watched tv for a while and I began to focus on little things with great intensity, like the glare of the lamp from behind me reflected on the screen. I also began to conserve words, only talking when absolutely necessary. And when I did it took alot of effort on my part. As the night went on I began to go deeper inside myself and had a harder time understanding what was happening on the tv. At my peak I remember I had a revelation about 'creating the world in which I exist', but I don't remember it in much detail. I felt like I discovered something and was afraid to lose it. Like a new me. Like I just woke up from a dream that I called my life. I was excited. Unfortunatly now that I have come back down, I don't remember or understand exactly what it was that I found.
814	Hopefully a stronger dose in a week or so will jog my memory :)
815	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
816	Side effects were mild stomache pain and disorientation. Other then that it was a very pleasant experience. I had to drive at one point during the night.

818	Since doing weed for my first time I have always been curious about Pycedelic mushrooms. Well it was about 6 p.m. And I was getting my haircut from the drug dealer who grows the mushrooms in his room. He said that if crush up a vitamin c pill it will help with the experience.
819	So as I'm waiting to get my haircut I put the mushrooms in a blender and blended them up with orange juice and vitamin c pills. As I'm getting my haircut I start to feel the effects of the mushroom. My body got very heavy and I felt really happy.
820	When I was done with my hair I was peaking. Then he gave me a ride home.I took off my coat and went directly to my basement. I stop at the bottom of the stairs and look at the carpet. Two seconds later the carpet has waves in it like the ocean.
821	After hanging out in my basement and listening to music I decided to go to my room because I didnt want my parents to see me when they come home from dinner. I then went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror and my pupils were gigantic, like quarters.
822	As I'm staring at my face in the mirror it starts to morph into shapes and creatures. One of the creatures was a frog.
823	Then I went to my room and layed and on my rug still peaking and I started to melt into the rug. This scared me so I jumped up and was fine.
824	Then my parents called me and told me that they were going to be another two hours. I said okay and hung up the phone. Then I started to run around my house like a maniac because I was so happy that they werent coming home.
825	I then went to the basement again and began to trip. I was starting to come down from the trip now and felt very mellow.

828	My best friend had come to my grandparents lake place, and we wanted to bond on a mental level. Thinking mushrooms were the key, we crushed them up and added them to lemonade, swallowing the clumpy, earthy froth.  
829	The effects came on for me within 15 minutes.  Light headedness, relaxed muscles, and a desire to sit down and sink into a beach chair overwhelmed me.  We got it together and took the boat out to the middle of the lake and watched puffy clouds spiral accross to sky.  Beautiful blues and contrasting sharp whites enveloped me.  The scene looked like something out of a time lapse photography.  All was calm, until my friend started ranting about seeing the devil's faced shaped within a cloud.  Him screaming, 'i see the devil!'  wasn't something I could take at the moment so we headed back to shore.
830	On shore the forest beckoned and I followed a trail a ways into the woods.  I had to pee, and as I stood doing so the bushes swayed and melted.  I had the feeling someone was looking at me.  I turned my head to see what it was, and the bushes leaves had become eyes, and they were turning to absorb the sun.  Leafy arms reached out to me, I blinked, and it was over.
831	The vision is still with me, very vivid, and in a strange way comforting.  From that day onward, I have felt that I am missing something, some part of the larger picture. From that day onward, I have felt that I am missing something, some part of the larger picture.  I plan someday to return to that place and try to recapture the moment I looked away, the moment I saw the green man.

834	The first time I did shrooms I was sooo excited.And once I took them I was like holy shit I just put myself on a journey I'm never gonna forget. I was laying in my friends room and we decided to go outside.WE were starting to feel a little goofing and funny.We decided to lay in the grass like a bunch of hippies(new age hippes). Then we kept getting up and sitting back down.One of the last times we stood up and back down we knew it was starting to hit us because we went to sit down and as we got to the ground all noises stop instantly like we had gone def or something.And that when all four of us were like holy fuckin shit here it comes we were laughing our asses off so hard.so we layed in the grass and I watched as the trees leaves stated turning into digital pictures.There were millions of little digital leaves all around me.Then about after an hour or so of that we went in my friends room and thats when I was really fucked up.I opened my eyes and watched my friend turn in a giant lizard and the patterns on his face were like watchin a windows media player when you listen to music.That was the color of his skin  and the patterns and colors were the most incredible thing I've ever seen in my life.    
835	The night was summed up into one sentence for me.
836	'Its like we were talking about something really important that wasnt important. Its like we were talking about something really important that wasnt important.'
837	Mushrooms is a life changing experience. I will never think the same about something even again.

840	I find that in low doses these mushrooms (grown in portland) produce an amazing yet manageable euphoria. All of my trips have been nearly the same. Starts with dizziness and nausea...soon to pass to an elated, energetic, talkative awareness with some slight shape shifting, the next part is the best...the whole body buzz...tingling in in my face and especially my toes. Only a slight but odd feeling of the two sides of my face shifting in opposite directions...like my head is twisting. Every trip (3 now) has been in a safe environment (among good friends) 2 house parties and a quiet bar. The body buzz is so amazing. I feel like I'm radiating. I've found that when alcohol is mixed, though, the next day is a bad hang over. I also notice that I do not like looking at myself in the mirror. My face looks very old and very wrinkled. Funny. I wonder if that's my fear projected. Overall it leaves me with no cares, I feel like I could say or do anything...I'm very relaxed and open and vivacious. I had no idea these trips would be so amazing. I plan to continue weekend use in low doses. I feel like I don't need anything else. I plan to continue weekend use in low doses. I feel like I don't need anything else. This is so much better than pot and x. Mostly because I know it won' t screw up my brain or smoke out my lungs.

843	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
844	On Friday I had an incredible mushrooms experience. I'd only done them once before, in a dark tent, and it was a horrible experience and I was wary of doing them again.  So I ate them anyways. When they hit I was in the car on the way to the dealers house.  We got more and went back to a friends house.  There were six people in total but my friend and I were the most fucked and no one else could understand our jibberish.  We could understand each other though. Most of the time we were just laughing because everything, even me passing her a glass and saying 'drink this' was hysterically funny.  I noticed a vase of flowers. We each grabbed one and spent the next 3 hrs dunking it in water and splashing it on ourfaces.The drops of cold water felt so amazing running down my face.  Then we sat on the floor and peeled and ate tangerines.  The smell and taste of them was the best thing I d ever eaten.  I took one and squeezed it and the juices ran down my hand and I licked them and it was awesome.
845	The thing I learned from this experience is that shrooms are amazing and I could have missed out on a lot of fun if I'd let my first trip scare me off of them...  I also learned that simple things like drops of water on a flower as I press it against my face or peeling and eating a tangerine are undescribable on this drug..

848	My friends and I ate some mushrooms and had some left over, so we decided to smoke up the leftovers with some pot.  After smoking the bowl, we all had very enjoyable body highs, as well as some visuals.  The trip only got harder by the time the eaten mushrooms kicked in (about 45 minutes after consumption).  
849	Just as a comparison we tripped on the same mushrooms about a month later (approx the same dosage), but this time without smoking any.  I found that I couldn't get the same body high (even with the help of pot)as before.  The mushrooms began to kick in about 40-45 mins later, but up to that point was pretty boring (sitting around and waiting).
850	Smoking mushrooms may not give me a long (or hard) trip on their own, but if they're smoked after eating a dose the effects appear much sooner, and the wait is much more enjoyable.

853	Me and a few friends were at an after party (we had e in our systems; Im sure this has relevency to the experience) we were smoking weed, discusing shrooms, and smoking shrooms.  I was recalling seeing something about it while in amsterdam, and my friend was like, 'yah Ive done it before it totally works'.  So without further adieu, he produced a bag of shrooms from his bag, and began to skin up some shroom J's.  The effects were similar to eating the mushrooms, but with less intense hallucinations (more like colour bursts and a loss of sense of time)  we became very 'jovial' laughed at pretty much anything, haha.  Was a good experience, very mellowing, and chilled, a lot more mellow/less intense than a regular shroom trip, and the effects were shorter lasting.  
854	PS there was no burning of the lungs, or loss of sight, as some rumours report! was quite smooth to smoke...

857	This was the first time that I had ever taken any kind of psychoactive plant.  3 of my friends and I got together on a Saturday night and ate our dose of mushrooms. As we started to come on to the mushrooms there was lots of giggling and we began to feel pretty loopy, so we decided to go walk around the neighborhood. We ended up in a nearby schoolyard.  I will never forget the experience of the trees beginning to speak to me.  They literally were laughing and talking to me. Linear time became holographic time.  I do not know how long we were outside, running around what seemed like a huge expanse of grass, laughing and looking up at the sky and clouds that were blowing by in the night sky. At one point we all stopped by what appeared to be a  divit in the grass.  As we drew closer the divit grew in to a great dark hole in the ground and grew in size as we stood over the divit, until it was a foot or two across. We had the sense that if we fell down the hole we would find ourselves in another realm of some sort and perhaps never be able to come back.  Some time passed as we looked down into the dark hole before us and we decided to back away and not get lost down the 'rabbit hole'. Our trip continued on for many hours, but that is the most distinct memory that I have from it.  Many years later I ended up learning about a trance like state where one could 'journey' to the lowerworld. The process involves inducing the trance like state by listening to the sound of a drum and envisioning a place on the planet (hole in a tree, body of water, or other place I feel drawn to on the earth) where I could dive down a dark hole, travel down a dark tunnel, and emerge into the underworld where you can meet various spirit guides, helpers and other beings. When I began apprenticing and learning about how to access and travel to this place, I couldn't help but reflect on my first experience with mushrooms, or 'Flesh of the Gods' all those years ago when I first saw an entrance to the lowerworld.

860	I felt my back snap with bands of muscle springing off my freedom. I watched an elicpse of the soul, of the mind, of our emotions and our selves. Seconds after it was murkiest the blot began to move, and I staggered through multicolored webs watching the world melting a mi alrededor. Feelings, ones I did not know existed, coursed through my veins. Ecstasy and agony gushing out of my bleeding eyes until all I could say was 'Just Be!' But the warmth curled around my back, care and love coaxing me gently out of the madness. Solo tu hubieras podido bring me back to myself and we blended into each other. All one presence. The earth mother, the serene frog, the mosquito, the root gnome, and that girl who birthed the beach, stretching and warping interweaving, dancing as a fluid. We had an epiphany or two and then the yin climaxed; and then: It began to fade. Only snapshots. Wow.

863	I took a small amount of mushrooms just before a Tool concert on august 2nd, and as I listened to the lyrics of the songs and watched the images on the screens, I suddenly understood the concept of third eye. I've taken mushrooms a number of times in the past, but this time was much more like a revelation than a trip. I began to understand how the brain remembers images and sounds; in a (as many mushroom users will know) constant vibration based on our memory of these things. I believe there is a parallel universe that exists entirely beyond the third eye and I think this is where we go when we die, but it is possible to visit this place by using meditation, mushrooms, and perhaps DMT (but I have not experimented with DMT yet). This 'parallel universe' I speak of is a very beautiful and infinite thing that everyone will portray differently, containing bodies and memories made out of energy, colors, and light. Tool has helped me understand this through their lyrics and imagery, and after that night has become more to me than just music. I would like to post more, but I simply cannot put the feeling into words. Happy Trails!

866	This is more of an introspective on mushrooms than an experience.
867	I am amazed at how mushrooms are different for everybody. I recentley did some with two friends, and we all had different experiences altogether. 
868	I personally become very paranoid and delusional. We went to a river near my city, and it felt like my friends were falling behind, or like they were going to fall into traffic. I was terrified about what would happen. 
869	However, afterwards is my favourite part of a mushroom trip. I feel so much more complete, and like I learned major things that everyone should learn in life. Off of on trip, I learned that I cannot take advantage of everything, and I should love what I have, and care for myself and my friends instead of just not caring about anything.
870	Mushrooms are a terryfing substance at points, yet mind boggling about how good they make me personally feel afterwards. It kind of feels like my mind went through an intense workout.

873	My friend gave me a call and said, 'Hey, do you wanna come trip some shrooms with me at my sister's apartment?' I of course said 'Hell yeah!!!' I went over and paid for them and ate them, most of the people there, whom I did not know, were dipping theirs in peanut butter, but I wasn't because the taste never really has bothered me. When my trip initiated I looked around and everything was beautiful. My friend who was sittin next to me (who I now know is a fucking bitch) would turn and whisper something mean and judgemental about the other people in the room. There was a purple aura emitting from her and I could tell that it symbolized the unpleasantness within her soul and now I can tell what kind of person someone is just by looking at them. I regard that night as the night that my third eye opened.

876	I just took shrooms for the first time 3 days ago.  I had been doing coke and smoking weed for about 3 years and few other drugs thrown in occasionally.  I had wanted to try shrooms for ever but where I lived they were so hard to get.  But one day my friend C and I met this girl, G, who said she could get a shrooms.  She said that they were chocolates, my friends had told me never to get chocolates because what people said that was the doasage of shrooms in each, was never right.
877	Supposedly, I bought 2 grams of shrooms in a chocolate.  It took about a week to get them.  I decided that I would take them friday during school (I'm a senior), and trip at the very end.  Well I ate them, and no tripping at school happend.  No effects.  I went to my friend L's house.  We smoked probably 2 or so grams in his garage in these brightly colord chairs..  On our last few bong rips, all the sudden everything exploded into color It had been 2 and a half ours since I had taken the shrooms.  An armoral can that was in the garage had a sun on it that was shining and flashing bright yellow and orange.  My friend L's face was green and I had a dot in my vision, like you get if you look at the sun.  One of L's friends then came over, and he was the trippiest part of my trip.  His face molded extremely in the faces like a dog lapping up water.  We then went up stairs to watch TV, but I couldn't watch the TV.  I could only watch them, because they seemed so interesting to me.  Like  they were a TV show.  I watched them for probably an hour.  We then headed off to my schools football game.  The only type of tripping, other than feeling like I was watching a TV show the whole time, was that I couldnt tell what time of day it was.  The lights made it seem like day, but I would look up at the sky, and it was black, so I knew it night time, but would forget every 5 minutes.
878	Now I'm in my psychadelic phase as I call it.  I plan on getting a quater of shrooms this week.  But stems and caps this time, no choclates.  So to everyone I really enjoyed the experience, because it made me see things in a different way.

881	This is my second experience with mushrooms. A few days ago a friend of mine had gotten me an eighth. My first experiance was with half an eighth so I figured I'd try a whole one this time. I decided to wait a few days to take them so I could clear my head. It was Tuesday night and I was in my room which is in the basemant of my house. I decided this would be a good night to shroom because it was my last night of rehab and I was glad to be done with piss tests and meetings.
882	I can smoke in my room at night because my mom's room is on the top level of the house so I had made sure to have some weed for the trip. I ate the whole eighth except for a few caps at around 9:00 PM after I got home from rehab. After I ate them I just sat at my computer talking to people waiting for them to kick in.
883	They started to kick in pretty quick. The first thing I noticed was the water in the picture on my desktop was moving. I talked to some people and listened to music for about an hour and then decided that it would be fun to go outside. I told my mom I was walking the dog and started out on my adventure. I walked outside and everything looked so beautiful. The sky was purple and the light coming from the lamp posts was red. As I walked my dog I ate the few caps I had saved. Tree branches were melting over and the stars were moving around in the sky. I walked around my neighborhood in a big circle and then went home. When I got home I took out my bowl and weed and made sure my mom was asleep before I started to smoke. Smoking felt really good, I don't know why but it did. I smoked a bowl at around 11:15 and then put on Simpsons and watched that for a little. While I was laying on my bed I looked at the Jimi Hendrix poster on my wall of Jimi playing guitar and his hands were playing. The rest of the night went by fast. I also looked at the KISS poster on my wall with a picture of each memeber's head and the heads started spinning in a circle like a ferris wheel. I smoked a few more bowls and ended up going to sleep at around 2:30. The trip was wonderful and I am looking forward to my next shroom trip.

885	It was a beautiful sunny fall day in laval cananda and my friend and I decided to take mush. We each took 3g's and sat at a park bench. When the mush started hitting me the color of the leaves and the sun started becoming brighter. We decided to go into the forest. We met up with a couple of friends and they were smashing a dead tree down with rocks. I was sittin there picturing cave men thousands of years ago doing the samething...and thought that human life has no point...were born to die..maybe they build these stores and made these cloths but its nothing...were so small. I had to take a walk, I ended up in an open part of the forest and saw all the dead leaves...and just saw death everywhere...I was looking at a tree and comparing it to the plant earth...were all just leaves...were nothing...we'll die but thier will be more. All I wanted to do was to go home and watch tv or a movie and distract myself from these depressing thoughts...

888	I have heard people on the internet talking about smoking mushrooms and one of my friends had told me of this.  One night I got out my bag of shrooms and collected all the small broken off peices and a few tiny caps and packed a bowl.  The effects were similar to weed exept some of the mental ones but it was a nice relaxing high.  I think eating them is better but if I only get like a small amount or just a bunch of broken little peices then I should smoke them

897	It started when me and a friend of mine named Matt went to pick up some psilocybe mushrooms.We went to talk to the person who was getting them for us.So we met at a friend's house.We gave her the money and she went to pick them up from out of state.So why she was doing that we sat around and smoked cannabis.Two hour passed before she showed up.She walked up to me and Matt and said 'Take these smelly things'.So we took the half ounce and left.We got back to my house where a couple of friends waited for us to return.We got inside where we separated the mushrooms.Matt got an 8th,I got the rest.Two seconds later Matt had already eaten his.I gave an 16th of an ounce to my friend Edd and ate a 4th of a ounce through out the night.Suddenly I noticed the posters on my wall looked like it was shaking.Then Matt bursted out laughing uncontrollably.He was laughing so hard he bumped his head againsthis knee.
898	Then my trip started to take shape. My head felt heavy and I just felt all around out of my mind,which was nothing new same as every other time I took shrooms.I started talking to myself and pacing back and forth.Then we decided we needed some fresh air.So we went outside and started smoking a bowl of cannabis.Then I looked up at a tree and seen double.I heard a noise from the ally.It sounded like an engine and it was.Of course my First thoughts were police but it was just a friend of mine we climbed in his car the walls were breathing in on me.After that We went inside were I repeated 'I'm going to die' and started pacing again.Then I started peaking I curled up in a ball and rocked for what seems like minutes but was actually hours.Every time I closed my eyes it felt like I was flying through my head and soon I could not open my eyes.And just like that it was done.All in all it was an ok trip the next day I shroomed again.It not being anywhere nere as intence as the night before,Dawm Tolorence.Write you guys next time I shroom.

901	I went to my friends house to see his amazing shrooms that he had picked and we ended up eating 3 mid sized fresh cubes each. About 30 minutes later nothing had happened so we decided to smoke a bowl, the weed must have acted as a catalyst because soon there after everything started to break up into colors and I felt extremely weak. I looked at my hand and it broke up into colors, I have done shrooms before but it had only given me a strong body high, this was my first actual open eye visual from any drug, my entire body felt like an upset stomach, but in a good kind of way... my entire body felt like an upset stomach, but in a good kind of way... 
902	I turned on my side and looked at the wall, its hard to explain but it seemed that the empty space between me and the wall rushed at me and formed a sort of force field with lots of little pockets of air, its very hard to explain but it was like the air had become solid around his desk. And when I looked deep into the crevices in it I could see twisting colors and rainbows, I'm not sure, but I believe I saw a color I've never seen before.
903	After that I dont remember much. And when it had all worn off I just wanted to be on it again, it was a truly spiritual experience in my mind and I feel I learned things about the way my mind and body work.

914	This is my experience with the first time I tripped shrooms. My friends and I were all waiting around about 8pm one night because we had just all bought 1/8ths for 40 dollars... After recieving the drug we quickly made our way to the table.. sorted the shrooms and devoured an eighth each.
915	We decided to go on a hike up into the hills (of Wyoming). We got to a nice hill away from housing, and smoked a few bowls of Nug trying to pass time before our trip came. About 1 hour later after walking a couple miles further into the hills I started to feel the effects. I lost all control of speech and could do nothing but mutter... Although this muttering was absolutley uncomprehensible, I was doing it so fast that I was amazed and drawn into it..
916	My friends tell me they decided to go home for the trip and left me out on this hill... All I remember was picturing myself in a large rave type concert/party out in the hills. About 2 hours later I somehow found my way back to my friends house were I was quick to realize all of us were tripping hard. One friend and I went to the front yard to admire the 'perfect sky' as my other friends stayed in to experiece the 'perfect song' and 'perfect guitar rift'....
917	The whole experiece seemed as though we had been put into the 'perfect place'. Alittle later we all found ourselves inside surrounding the dinner table, this is where my night got worse. I asked what time it was... I was quick to get an answer. '2 o'clock'... We sat there.. staring.. waiting.. talking of such things as 'Nothing is Not' and comparing our sanity to that of the common equation '1=1'.. after what seemed to be a couple hours I asked what time it was again, and was quick to get the reply.... '2 o'clock'... With this in mind.. Time stopped for what I calculated to be about 8+ hours that stayed '2 o'clock' and NO the clock was not broken. All in all I believe that if one doesn't mind losing oneself in mind and body, shrooms are excellent. If one has trouble with sanity as it is.. this is not one's drug.

920	I had been wanting to try mushrooms for a long time. I had already been an alcoholic, stoner, and coke head (in that order). It was time to hallucinate. I drove to the city where I was going to purchase mushrooms at a really good price, so it was worth the drive. I picked them up and me and a few friends went cosmic bowling. I decided that eating a little bit wouldn't hurt. I had tried them once before this experience but it was nothing extraordinary.
921	I ate a couple grams in the bathroom and went back out. It's unfortunate that we left just as they started to kick in because the cosmic bowling place was insane. I think the lights and drawings on the walls would have been a cool part of a hallucination. 
922	I didn't expect 2 grams to change my thoughts. I made up a person in my head that was telling me the actual meaning of life. I knew that the person wasn't real but I was so convinced that she/he was right. I thought I was a meaningless organism that deserved to die. I probably would have hung myself then if I was functioning properly. I stared at my hand, hallucinated, seeing different angles, etc. I had a thought that movies, cars, and all that were just in a series of technology that 'we' distributed through the minds of scientists to make people think that the world is progressing. 
923	I 'went back to my body' and my mind said, 'It's okay, you can go back now, we've explained it all.' I was petting a cat and felt connected to it because I had black nail polish on and the cat was black. I felt like animals knew exactly what I knew, which sort of sounds a bit nuts now. 
924	I would say that my experience wasn't exactly a 'glowing' experience or anything, but it almost felt like an out of body experience. I had to go home and talk to people and act normal and it totally ruins the high.

927	So I had a day off from work finally and decided I really wanted a psychedelic experience, took out my bag of mushrooms and downed the disgusting fungi. While waiting for my experience to begin I smoked some cannabis (usually helps me stay calm during the come up) and then it started to hit me. Everything looked as if it was alive, even my pants began to breath and form multiple patterns. It was like my first trip all over again it made me so happy I burst out laughing, laughing so hard I began to get tears. All the ideas that flowed through my head interested me and lead to me playing my guitar. Each note I played had a meaning to me so I began to play whatever came to mind, and ended up making up the best song that I have ever wrote. Of course playing guitar while on mushrooms was fun within itself just because of my amp and pedals sinking into the ground, and my hand forming colors as I moved my hand up and down the neck of my guitar. After this amazing music experience on magic mushrooms I look at them in a totally different way. Music already had a strong meaning to me but now ill never look at it the same.

930	2 weeks ago I decided to trip at my friends house while he watched me. I call my connect and recieved 8 grams of mushrooms. I was looking forward to tripping that night and everything was going great. His parents went to sleep at around 8 pm. I took what I thought was 4 grams at this time. (it turned out to be 5 )
931	I hadn't eatin all day so I began to feel weird after about 10 minutes.  I was feeling a bit scared as I do everytime I take mushrooms but when the effects came on I knew I wasn't gonna have the greatest trip. I went into the living room and looked in a mirror when I looked at myself I looked evil like a demon. That scared the shit out of me. I told my friend ''I think I'm havin a bad trip'' so we went to his room and he had a poster of the band kiss on his wall that was very unpleasant. By this point I was tripped out and I felt like I couldn't trust my friend I didn't want him near me because he looked like a demon as well. Hes my bestfriend but for some reason he really was scaring me. The next thing I knew I was in the middle of his kitchen floor eating a big thing of cheese (in an attempt to bring myself down) after wards I was calm and we went back to his room. The rest of the night was great I thought about how much better the world would be if everyone would just take acid all the time and it was great (:

934	It was a Tuesday night around 2 am, my friend, M, had obtained some mushrooms. I did not want to eat a lot tonight so I decided to eat .5 grams of them. I eat them with a chocolate bar and it makes it taste great. 
935	3am I begin to fall asleep, so I decide to go upstairs and notice a blueish glow in my bed from the color of my shades.
936	The dream was an exact reenactment of the night, starting from when I ate the mushrooms.  I was walking around my house and walked up to my room and noticed my room had a very intense blue glow as if the moon were inches away from my bedroom. I looked down and saw myself sleeping, after I noticed myself sleeping I dove into my sleeping body and woke up. 
937	6am I awake and my mind is racing, my pupils are Also very dilated. I get up to get a drink of water and notice a very strong body high and a slight glow to certain colors.

940	SIDENOTES: My past drug use: Weed, Alcohol, tobacco, Ketamin, Mushrooms, cocaine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, lorazepam, Extacy, Codeine.
941	So It started off acquiring a large mass of gold cap mushrooms from a friend of mine. I tested these out a week ago and ate 1.5 grams. While listening to pink floyd I felt like I was underwater. But thats another story.
942	So Me and my friend (call him B) get home from school. Get down to the basement, we are both on completely empty stomachs no food in the past 3-4 hours (atleast). We eat well say 2-3grams (out of the 4 in each of our bags). Chug some juice to get it out of our molers and then depart to a forest.
943	About 30 minutes later walking I could see the road beside looked as if it were waving up and down a little bit. I could tell this was the start of something special.
944	We are in the forest with other friends We'll call A, T and N. T had a few to drink and smoked too much weed and is now in the tent rolling around half conscious. A and N are drinking excessively and partying. Me and B start to think and finish the rest of our mushrooms putting us at 4 grams total.
945	For the past 30 minutes we had some fun talking to our friends and partying. B and I decided to walk off a bit and stared at things in the forest and just talked about how beautiful they were and that all these things were naturally occuring.
946	After that adventure which felt like hours (It was around 15 minutes) My mind shifted into a Need vs. Want mode and I was comparying everything near me to the movie 'Into the Wild' Which is about survival and not living by the standards of society.
947	My friend B went back and was talking to himself very loud and fast regarding science and the meaning of life. It was his 2nd doing shrooms and i was past this stage so i decided to go on a journey of my own I went and sat in an opening and discovered Dear bones. I just sat pondering society and how beautiful it would be just to live on your own in a forest like this and live off of survival.
948	We had explored the forest for a good 2 and a bit hours and had our fun discussing the meaning of things. My friend B saw two of our other friends on their way to the forest so he picked up 2 bottles and clanged them together to get there attention, The 2 bottles broke and me and him broke into a fit of laughter which did not stop till the trip was over.
949	From now on anything we said related to one of our inside jokes which we had many and it just didnt stop.
950	Our friend T finally got up so we left the forest to goto a local sub shop. On the way there Me and B spotted a soccer field that was just so deliciously green we had to go sit in the middle of it. It was amazing and bright. After we were tired of it we went onward to the sub shop.
951	On our way to the sub shop, (now I have done shrooms many times but this has been the most intense/different trip ever) I felt like we were from back to the Future and we were from the future in the past cuz I had seen all the buildings before but they were just so different in my mind.
952	We reach the sub shop, All 3 of us go inside me and B cannot stop laughing at anything and just feel ridiculous and everyone was staring at us so we just left straight up and sat outside behind the building waiting for T. NOW!!!! While we were waiting here there were this group of white kids in track suits (Yes track suits) holding bags of chewing tobacco (yes ziploc bags) and they asked us if we were blazed and stuff we just said yeah we smoked a quarter and I thought B knew them... It was the weirdest fucking incident ever and when i found out they were 100% random and none of them knew any of us I thought it was ridiculous And everything was still funny for know reason.
953	Back to the forest we go. We were walking down this one street and one little kid who looked to be 2 yrs old waved and said hi and this was ridiculous to us. And then there was a random guy playing guitar in his driveway with 5 redneck kids with mullets surrounsding him.
954	Closer to the forest, We stop on a bridge and admire the beauty and color of this river when all of a sudden a dog snuck behind us and scared us and we got into an uncontrollable laughing fit.
955	We are at the top of the forest (Me, B, T) our other friend M showed up and N had magged and fallen in the river twice and lost bother her shoes. This was still ridiculously funny to me and B. When all of a sudden on a cement path behind us connected to a wooden bridge 3 dirt bikers in full sponsored dirt biking apparel drive by and me and B questioned whether it was real or not because of all the fucked up things that happened that night.
956	For 30 seconds everything was gray/Black and White and then all of a sudden I didn't feel as stupid and everything wasn't funny and I was real again and everything was real.
957	This experience was ridiculous most profound, idiotic shroom trip ever. I describe it was we were babies rediscovering the world.
958	The entire time my mind was set on the movie 'Into the Wild' and while high if a cop tried to arrest me I would've laughed and told him he doesn't have the authority to do that. I don't allow him, I never swore under having to follow any laws I was just born.
959	It was about 8 o'clock at this time on a Thursday night. We went and jumped on my buddies trampoline for a bit (all of us) then went to subway, Hit a HUUUGE SESH! got more munchies and called it a night.
960	Hope you enjoyed reading this fucked up mess haha

962	It rubs your face in it. It really does, the experience is only just fading and I'm totally unsure what to make of it, was it good? was it bad? I'm sure to find out in the coming months....
963	So anyway, I have been severely depressed for as long as I can remember now... I have tried various antidepressants/counseling etc and to me, its all bullshit.
964	So that's when I decided to start looking into psychedelics as a way of 'seeing into my problems' and WOW that's what I got. 
965	I apologize for the lack of depth and detail in this report, I just wanted to convey that mushrooms just took many of the problems in my life, that I have been avoiding thinking about, shielding myself from maybe. It took these issues and has just spent the last 4 hours rubbing them in my face, made sure I got a real close look at them.
966	It remains to be seen whether this was a good thing or not, I'm hoping that it is!

969	I ate a couple stems for the body high but I ended up having the craziest dream.
970	I was in a modern city in a nonspecific country and was told by a voice that if I could fit infinity into my head I would become God.  So I proceeded to try to pack everything into my mouth, the ground pulled up like a bedsheet and fit into my mouth as I ate it.  I could feel my consciousness expanding, seeing the universe as a whole and understanding what I was seeing. Right as I was about to see everything perfectly I woke up choking on a blanket. I ended up with a really sore throat and a horrible sinus and ear infection. I guess it was my punishment for toying with Gods power.

972	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Unknown Context (20)
973	Setting: Me and two other friends which I will refer to as D and J outside on my back porch trippen balls on mushrooms. And we were smoking and drinking also.
974	Substances: 1/8 of mushrooms each..down the hatch. A couple of joints of White widow (Real good KB). A nice tall bottle of GoldShlager. 3/4 Empty.
975	 Well there we were. Just me and My friends on a normal friday night trippin our balls off, talking the shit, and just havin a good old time. We ate the mushrooms about an hour and a half before sitting around the campfire. We were searching for spiritual findings but all we found was astonishment. As I casually poured myself a drink I noticed everyones faces were aging into a zombie like corpse. I was thinking maybe they are trying to tell me something like my life is going in the wrong direction. So I pondered on that thought a while while pouring my 8th shot of GoldShlager and realized I was right I need to completely change my life, stop being an asshole to my parents and brother. As the flames sparked into the air my friends and I conversed about the very distant future and what lies ahead in certain phenomenal machinary. My hands felt as if two baloons were attached two them making my arms float up in the air (gave me thoughts of the wall). The flames were beautifully intertwining with each other in psychedelic swirls of uncertainty.
976	Then I did the dumbest, careless thing I could think of that would send my trip into the dark abyss but only for a short while. You see, the fire was started with axe deoderant spray, so I carelessly threw it into the fire knowing that it was empty. About ten minutes later my friends and I were talking about what it will be like when we cross over to the other side, when all of a sudden BOOM. It sounded, and felt as if a spud gun had shot a medicine ball into our chests. We sat there in awe thinking to ourselves 'Did we just die?' Colors intertwined in my eyesite even stronger than before, and a ringing like you do nitrous oxide prevailed as i tried to figure out what the hell just happened. My thoughts, neutral, as I pulled myself together and realized the dumb mistake I had initiated. Damn was I an idiot I thought, as I looked over at my friend in tears. Poor kid..it sent him on an insanity spree thinking he had crossed over for a good hour. The moral of the story: -Dont' be a dumbass like me and throw axe deoderant spray cans into the outdoor fireplace.

978	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
979	One boring summer day, me and my friend Jordan decided a couple grams of mush would be just what we needed to top off our day.  Unfortunately I don't remember much about the trip as it happened several years ago, but the point to this report is that I do remember what happened when I smoked some.
980	About 2 and a half hours after after eating the mushrooms, we were finding ourselves coming down, and of course, no one wants to end a good mushroom trip.  I had heard about smoking mushrooms, but was unsure if it would work.  It took my a bit to convince my friend to try since it's a common rumour where I live that if you get the smoke in your eyes, you'll go blind.  I thought this is ridiculous, but we were careful to close our eyes anyways, just to be safe. After the first couple of hits, I found my self quickly going back up.  It was night and remember everything looking like it came out of final fantasy 7.  Even though I was In the neighborhood I'd grown up in, nothing seemed familiar, it all seemed changed some how, but I don't think I could possibly describe this change.  Words don't exist for that.  I was very confused, it didn't trigger any visuals, but the body high I get when mushrooms just kick in was very strong.  It only lasted about 30 minutes or so and made me feel VERY ILL.  It also left me very mushtarded and made everything I ate for the rest of the night taste like smoked mushrooms.  This is a very bad taste.  Another of my friends tried this the next day, but didn't eat any first, just smoked them and said he didn't feel any effects.

983	I've seen some write about getting 'blackouts' after ingesting mushrooms and I too have experienced this.
984	I've now in my life had a few seizures, ALMOST all of them with some association to mushrooms.
985	My theory is that some persons body's, myself included greatly struggle to digest mushrooms, to the extent that it causes the body to go into shock and in SOME cases seize/blackout.
986	I know for myself I'm also allergic to penicillin (my only allergy) and that is what has also lead me to this hypothesis.
987	I figured I'd share my thoughts for anyone with the similar experiences and questions...

991	Didn't eat for a while then ate them and wrote this
992	Lycaeum people started to follow me secretly and cheaply imitate the sacred (partly my fault)
993	I want to break that bond now (to lycaeum and random internet places)
994	And find kindred spirits who can be here in the physical world
995	The creator blessed me with so much but I have to find the right place to share it, blessed me and also made me a wierd ass, random as oats kind of girl hehe
996	I hope this resolves any tension there may be between me and people for words or actions
997	Understand I am mostly blind unguided, and I'm also hearing 'schizophrenic'
998	But I'm learning to hear inner wisdom through listening and experience
999	I definitely have made mistakes, and mistakes have been made about me,
1000	But I grow from them and move on as we understand more
1001	Let us remember sometimes the best healing cana be a bit like the trickster confounding or frustrating at first
1002	So the old are also saints and old spirits, bodhisattvas can take any form the universe teaches with everything
1003	Our Higher Selves/Self brings everything to us for a reason
1004	They don't waste anything, we gravitate back spontaneously and irresistibly to embody them
1005	Great mother, and remember words are only words
1006	And it came back full circle to anya and to pond, we were there
1007	And we listened to modest mouse on shitty headphones and it was so deep and meaning and we flew
1008	Isaac brock is a genius song writer, moon and antartica, we fully lived that album
1009	Then we went out to the street among the tricksters ini and sang and did merry happy holiday things,
1010	Saw the great trees and the snow, everything is so beautiful
1011	Truth is I am irish, and I'm proud to be irish, and I know who my family is and everything, and that's the reason I am crazy now I suppose, kind of a funny mess of a curse which mixed everything up, and even cursed not to have the best memory to recall the exact circumstances... The truth also is that I'm black, and I'm also proud of that because black people are awesome and the world is entirely too effing racist still, but it's gotten and is getting a lot better, which is great, maybe I was racist in a past life, and a more unifying truth is that I'm descendent from weavers... And that's just what it is.
1012	I'm happy to speak for the plant spirits, and help this wisdom to be circulated, because it's important, cannabis and many other plants are great healers, pharm drug companies must cease their foolishness, I just don't understand why these people just want to get richer and richer exploiting others and not even giving the best service, that's messed up and it's actually deeply hurting the world, this is the best way I know to address it, but what goes around comes around and as isaac brock sings in the modest mouse song, the third planet
1013	'if you go astray long enough you end up where you were'
1014	I consider myself kind of a yogi as well, and I take responsibility for all in my consciousness, because in the end, it's all kind of a joke, I've always felt like that life is art, and art is what's inside, if we collectively stopped blaming others and took responsibility for our own thoughts and used them to remember and create the paradise which this planet and which our spirits truly hold, theres no doubt it would happen, and I think really it would be pretty easy...
1015	[link / lyrics to Modest Mouse - Third Planet]
1016	And the schizophrenia is the voice in me head, the truth the primordial spirit that will never go, no matter who tries to obscure, and yeah..
1017	Now I officially take a break from this internet shit, because its gone to far and its getting stupid, I'm not like.. I don't even know, most things I just do because they're funny,  this is the closure, it's been long and weird as they say

1019	Mushrooms - P. mexicana (193) : Alone (16), Poetry (43), General (1)
1020	Ingested the shrooms, tasted completely foul but that's normal.
1021	Set: My house, later on I'm out and about in my suburb.
1022	Absolutely no preparation was made for this trip, which in hindsight was somewhat regrettable. If I had prepared, I probably wouldn't have experienced the paranoia that I did at the train station.
1023	I distinctly remember the computer screen made everything very colourful.
1024	I get ready to go down the street, takes about a billion years because I'm abnormally self-conscious (dunno why). Eventually get out, trippin balls something baaaaaaaad. I reach the train station, sit down and wait. While I'm waiting I all of a sudden come to the realization of 'holy shitt, I'm on very hard drugs and I don't think I'm ready for them. uttttt it was way too late for that. The train platform starts moving in a pattern similar to that snake optical illusion.
1025	On the train, there are like 10 little girls dressed as fairies on the train.
1026	I get off the train and start walking, although at this point I'm not walking, the ground is just moving in order for me to reach my destination.
1027	Wander around the suburb for god knows how long (and god knows why), end up sitting down and feeling very paranoid.
1028	Uh oh! Cops are driving past. They fuck off though, and I go and get some smokes.
1029	I cross the road and sit down, coming to the realization that everyone is going somewhere, and when they get there they're going somewhere else. Me, I'm going absolutely nowhere. I have no money, forgot my key to the house and have absolutely nothing to do.
1030	So I chill on a bench and marvel at how amazing everything is. I'm listening to some hardstyle megamix and I close my eyes. All I see is red, then a colourful grid pattern.
1031	I open my eyes and the most intense part of the trip is gone
1032	I walk back home, apply for a casual job at a restaurant near me and wander back in the direction of my house.
1033	On the way back I see T, who's heading off with X to Sherbrook Forest to do some trippin themselves. I hang out with them for a bit, catch a train for no reason, catch a train back and then bang! all gone.
1034	I don't recall a lot of the trip, but I do remember that I was completely unprepared for it. I ate them expecting absolutely nothing to happen, but man, did it happen.

1036	Mushrooms - P. subaeruginosa (123) : General (1), Alone (16)
1037	Ive orally ingested mushrooms several times and consider myself pretty acquainted with the affects. 
1038	I packed a glass pipe with 2 Grams of medium-high grade dried, coarsely ground psilocybin caps and proceeded to smoke it.  The smoke was very harsh to the throat and lungs, but the taste was bearable.  I smoked the entire bowl and waited it out. 
1039	After a few minutes I became slightly more relaxed and my vision became a little blurred.  After 10 minutes of just sitting around (feeling like I just smoked some pot), I got up and engaged myself in repairing my truck.  After I stopped thinking about the 2 grams I smoked my mind was completely clear again (25 minutes) and I was left only with motivation.
1040	This experience has furthered my belief that the human mind is a powerful thing. Ive seen and experienced this phenomenon occur with other substances as well (Hydrangea leaves, garden variety salvia, etc). If I think Im gonna get high from smoking mushrooms, my mind doesnt want to disappoint, so my perception is altered.  As I engage myself in a different train of thought my senses are returned to normal.  
1041	This may sound far fetched, but I'd say smoking mushrooms is more of a placebo effect than a chemical high, especially when smoked with other substances (cannabis, tobacco), where I may be able to intensify the affects of one drug by thinking Im being influenced by the other.  
1042	I am not a doctor, so forgive me if I'm blatantly wrong here.  Im just stating the conclusions Ive come to through my own experimentation.
1043	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
1044	One boring summer night, my friend B calls me up and tells me that he's bored and wants to do shrooms.  Normally I would of obliged right away, but being tired from work and having a slight cold, I tell him that it would be better to wait a couple days.  I told him this because I know that mind set and mood influence trips of any kind under any substance.
1045	Eventually I gave in and told him that I'll pickup 2 grams each for us. We both consumed the brownie mushrooms (mmmm) around 8 pm.  It should be noted that my friend weighs 180 lbs, and I weigh 130, and this was the first time he has done 2 grams before.  I had done 2 grams once before and enjoyed the experience, which actually changed my life for the better.
1046	Around 8:30 we decided that we should smoke some cannabis to jump start the trip, even though we both admitted that we felt it coming on.  So I took out my cell and called my friend D up, he happily agreed to come pick us up to have a session.  We smoked a couple doobs and listened to A Tribe Called Quest, (which has awesome beats and is just generally trippy whether on shrooms or not). 
1047	I noticed my friend B, who was sitting in the back of the car wasen't saying anything at all, I asked him if he was ok and he quickly commented that he's starting to trip hard.  Hearing this, I roll up another joint and we smoked it.  The ride back to my house was very relaxing, and I felt my mind wander off thinking about anything and everything. I was having a great time, and I was pretty sure B was too.
1048	Once D dropped B and me off back at my place, we continued to walk around our town.  B wanted to go inside my house, but I told him that being on mushrooms outside is far better than being inside.  He agreed and we walked for a good 30 minutes.  B then turns to me and says his stomach hurts.  I told him that mushrooms are a poison and stomach discomfort is normal.  
1049	Around +2 hours into the trip, as we're walking back to my house, B turns to me again and tells me that his stomach is starting to hurt really bad.  I ask him if he's going to throw up and he doesnt say anything.  Me being on shrooms, having a fairly good time, and my friend looking pretty bad, I start to get a little paranoid.  Around 10:15 we are on my street about 3 minutes away from my house.  Neither B or me is talking.  B then turns to me and in a scared voice says; 'Man, just talk.. say something, anything..'  I guess the silence and increased awareness was really starting to scare him. I tell him we're almost home.  
1050	As we're walking up to my house, I can tell he's going to purge, I tell him to quickly get to the downstairs bathroom so my parents dont see him.  He runs into my bathroom, closes the door and immediatley throws up.  
1051	Long story short, B is in my bathroom for another hour and a half.  I end up having to lend him pants because he threw up on his.  I drove him home around 1 am, although the plan was for him to stay over at my place, I thought he would like being home instead.  
1052	I smoked a joint with him the next day to reflect on last nights excursion, and he tells me that he was hung over from the night before and didnt eat anything that day.

1054	Mushrooms (39) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
1055	My friend and I were coming down off of our mushroom trip. (It was about 5 hours after we had first eaten them). I came up with the idea to pack a bowl of mushrooms in my pipe, I had always wanted to try to smoke them. At this point in time I was only tripping a little, so I went into the bathroom and began to smoke the mushrooms. The bowl lasted forever, the shrooms just didnt seem to end. My Friend and I each took about 10 hits of the shrooms, and at first i didnt really realize any difference, then slowly my hallucinations came back very strong. My visuals were going out of control, but i didnt really have a crazy body high at all. I looked at the floor in the bathroom, and it seemed to be folding in on itself, this is hard to explain, but it was really cool. The intense visuals only lasted about 10 minutes. My friend and I both agreed that the smoking of the shrooms just brought back our visuals for a short time and nothing else.

1	We walked back to O's house and I rolled up a few more joints. We went around to another friends house, S and smoked these in her bedroom. Eventually we said our goodbyes and see you tommorows, and I headed off home.
2	I had a strange walk ahead of me, through groves of trees, with a pinprick of light at the end. I couldnt see my feet because of the dark. I usually would have been slightly nervous when sober, but the effects of the weed were just intensifying this. I felt incrediably scared, I was sure the grim reaper was following me. I kept repeating 'its just the drug, home is only a few minutes away', and got out of the first tunnel of trees.
3	Then the rain started. Gently it covered my face in a mist, and I started down the grassy hill, and got into the second tree-tunnel. I eventually got home, and it was about midnight. I went up to bed and experienced the spinning head I last remember with alcohol. It took me a long time to get to sleep, and thoughts raced through my head.
4	Anyway, looking back on it, the laughs I had on the bench were well worth it, and the spiritual aspects I experienced in the tennis courts were quite interesting and well worth 30mins of mildly severe fear.

6	Cannabis (1) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
7	To give a little background on myself, I am 16 years old and have been smoking for over a month now. I have had many problems with my dad and ended up going into a deep depression due to me not being able to express my emotions, but little did I know this was about to change.
8	Onto the trip, it was a good Wednesday morning, my friend spent the night as we were planning on going to the movies with two of our other more experienced stoner friends. So, we figure out the time and movie that we are going to see. The movie started at 11:40 and we got there around 11:20 or 11:30 giving us time to smoke a blunt in the car. About halfway through the smoking session one of my friends points out that it is already 11:45, so we finished up the blunt rather quickly and started walking to the theater.
9	By this time I am already feeling the effects. We get the tickets and find the theater, and by this time the lights are already off so we can't see a thing.
10	We were going to sit on the top row since we were in a small theater, so while walking up the seemingly endless stairs I realize that I won't be able to see if the stairs end and I will probably hit the seats at the top and fall. So I am trying to keep my balance as I take each step. Eventually I reach the top and like I had figured I hit the seats and stumbled, but I did not fall due to me holding the rail. I slide down a couple seats giving my friends room and I just relaxed.
11	It was probably about 5 more minutes and the movie started, I was reaching my climax at this point. The movie we were seeing was a Sci-Fi movie, so I knew that it was probably going to be frightening and verry strange. I was right, the movie was very odd and I had trouble keeping up with it. During the first ten minutes of the movie all I could see was a small part of the screen that I was focusing on and the rest was blurry. This being a quite frequent effect that I get I enjoyed it, moving my focus to different spots on the screen trying to guess what was going to happen, etc.
12	Enough about the movie, By the time I got home I was still decently high. Since my parents are divorced my dad calls me every other week on Wednesday. So it gets to that time and he calls, and due to the effects of the Marijuana without hesitation I told my father how I truly felt about what he has done. 
13	Without the help of Marijuana I believe that I would have ended in deep depression before this year ended, if not worse.
14	I will deffinitely continue my use of Marijuana.

16	Cannabis (1) : Families (41), General (1), Various (28)
17	Its been a long time since my last dose of Bhang (dried and powdered Cannabis flowering tips ingested orally). The body grows and ages fast but the growth/decay of the soul is slower.
18	I was going through a phase of life where I felt that I was not in a very good place emotionally and it would not have been a good idea to take Cannabis at that time. Since then I have shifted home and am in a better place emotionally.
19	I haven't begun to grow Cannabis in my new place yet but  managed to get Bhang from a friend and took a pellet last week. Following is my trip report which is basically, as always, a list of some of the random thoughts and ideas that began to blitzkrieg my mind:
20	I live on the second floor of an apartment building and sat in my balcony looking out at the surrounding apartment buildings, the clothes hanging out to dry in the balconies flapping in the wind, the pigeons flying from one roof to another -all seem to come alive and were throbbing in synchrony with the music playing in my mobile.
21	Shapes can convey/invoke emotions. Figures and shapes with sharp edges are the creation of and appeal to the logical side of our minds whereas shapes with smooth curvaceous edges appeal to the emotional subconscious part of us.
22	Everything behaves according to their inert nature or Svabhava and Prakruti (Sanskrit). There is no free will. In order to exercise free will one needs to overcome ones inner embedded tendencies.
23	The human personality has three aspects - the Distracted Doer, the Tempter/Counselor and the Witness. The Distractor Doer is all the time distracted by the illusory nature of Reality or Maya. The Temptor/Counsellor guides/misguides you out of ignorance/wisdom. There is no separate Evil and Good or the Devil and Angel, two entities of voices that whisper in your ears. There is just one, like two sides of the coin who whisper to you. It is up to to the waking-discerning   Doer whether it makes this inner voice a tempter or a guide. The Witness, is just that,  a Witness. It is the unknowable super conscious part of us that only a lucky few can ever realize fully.
24	Written words too have an aura. The strength and nature of which depends on their meaning and the kind  of people who have been using them for centuries. Their energy of intention is embedded in them and when spoken out loudly with the right intention and energy they have the power to act on the material world. This is the science behind magical spells and mantras.
25	The Human mind is actually a cluster, consisting of and giving out parallel streams of thought/energy. To the normal waking mind, which is not under the influence of any psychotopic plant/drug and is therefore  slow at grasping these multiple stream of thoughts simultaneously, they seem to appear one after the other.  Under Cannabis, the mind is conscious of these simultaneous stream of thoughts and is able to look at each of them separately. But the speed at which these thoughts arise is mind boggling !! Perhaps in case of of  schizophrenics this cluster is in a reality-shattering overdrive.
26	Then there is also a parallel phenomenon  where a thought/intention arises followed by an emotion,  but to the normal mind it appears as one infused with other. We are incapable, therefore, of a pure thought or intention or feeling except under exceptional circumstances. If we were, we would be able to move mountains just with our minds !!  In Star Wars, Yoda tells his young apprentice  to 'Believe' when Luke is unable to lift X-wing out of the Dagobah swamp with his mind.
27	Most of our thoughts/intentions are infused with self-doubt/insecurity etc., all of which are different variations of the one primeval feeling of Fear. In Hindusim there is a universal blessing: Nirbhaya Bhava- be fearless.  Be fearless, of not some external mortal enemy, but your inner fears and self-doubts. Under the influence of Bhang I became actually aware of an intention to do something arising in my consciousness and then almost immediately a feeling of self-doubt or fear  piggyback riding on this intention, like a vampire, sucking out all the energy from it.  All those books teaching the power of positive thinking ask you to believe in yourself but do not teach you how to get rid of the claws of fear digging into your subconscious. This fear will be there as long as the Self identifies itself with the body, mind and ego.
28	Thoughts occur in a different plane/dimension which modern Science has yet to break into. Dreams are actually  the journeys of our conscious, sub-conscious and supra-conscious selves into their respective dimensions/planes of existence. We awake with distorted memories of these journeys. The enlightened souls come back with un-distorted memories.
29	The partaking of psychotropic substances in certain faiths -shaman, Sufism, Hinduism and others- is for the Guru to decipher/discern what state her/his disciple has reached in their spiritual journey. As change in perception induced by the drug and the consequent thoughts, emotions and visions that arise indicate the progress of the disciple.
30	The body is the product of our consciousness. The physical body arises out of our individual Consciousness and not the other way around.
31	Sound pollution is more damaging than chemical pollution as it effects our nervous system and hence our mental and emotional well being. In the long run the very nature of our consciousness will change. The polluting sounds have a suffocating effect blocking our nerves, nodes and glands. This renders us more and more insensitive/deaf to the subtle vibrations so essential for our spiritual growth.
32	In order to understand/realize certain concepts/ideas one needs to think with one's heart/emotional self rather than the logical mind. The heart too has a kind of intelligence, I would call it lateral intelligence.
33	Almost at the peak of my high, I switched on some hemi-sync music and lay down with my eyes closed. Withing a few moments I could feel a vibration in my fingers and toes, and a feeling that my body was preparing to lift off !! It was disorienting and a bit scary. And once fear entered my mind, it was over. Was I about to have an out of body experience (OBE) ? Perhaps I will try it next time around and might discover something.

35	Like any other day, my brother and I were driving to Ultimate Frisbee practice at the local park, rolling some joints and listening to Phish, when we met up with three other frisbee companions and proceeded to smoke all five joints in our van, when we finished, ready and in the proper state of mind for a serious game of frisbee, we stepped out of the billowing side door and walked from the parking lot five feet to the field. Immediately, I felt the calming effects of the tasty bud, and kept humming my favorite Phish song (bouncing around the room), when it happened. 
36	How can I accurately describe an out of body experience? It was like I was hanging from a nearby tree, watching myself walk slowly down the field. Id see myself, then see myself see myself, if that makes sense. I had a double out of body experience. I had a double out of body experience. 
37	Yet I was just walking down the sideline, it was like a movie, you know, where you could zoom in and out, make your own character, then BE the character. This whole action took about 30 seconds, but during that day I constantly felt this over and over, Ive never been that high and conscious since, but wouldnt hesitate to try again.

40	Potent BHO infused rock sugar candy.  I had a lot at the 420 rally. Its hits fast with in 20 minuets I felt it.  I wander off walking to a teahouse.  My memories from that point on happen in 20 second increments.  Like every 20 seconds I get to look through my own eyes. Dragged away from my memory I was in that moment. I could recall sobriety but it was fleeting.  Once at the bridge my movements became a bit stiff.  My ankles did not move as they should.  Gravity, it seemed had its thumb on my head and solders but this only slowed me down. No paranoid thoughts and just a bit nervous. 
41	My trek was over, I was home.  Got some food in me and I felt better but still stiff.  I then had a nap. Upon waking I continued eating small bits of candy every 1-2 hours. I was couch-locked and later at 2 am I went to sleep.
42	So basically I had 3 doses at once.  The jelly candy sample and the hard candy sample and my cookie. 
43	It affects my memory.  Memories don't record that well. This afternoon I went for a walk to ferry terminal.  As of now I only retained segmented fragments of that walk.  It was if I was home then at the park with little or no memories of the journey between the two. This trend continued over my walk.  I remember sitting at the ferry terminal then at the wooden steps of the graveyard then the last 20 feet to home. The feeling of sun on my skin was magnetic. I was intaking sunshine. About 2 Km round trip.
44	Its 6 o'clock now and the small bits of candy I had this morning are still affecting me.
45	For 20 bucks that jar of candy has over 30 doses for me at least.  That combined with my low tolerance for this stuff. Makes it a great deal.

48	All names have been changed to protect those involved.
49	A few years ago I was almost hit by a car, the driver of which turned out to be a merchant of the marijuana kind. After an exchange in numbers and an apology bud, I met up with a friend (male).  
50	We were both very into our puff at the time and liked to try different strains of the substance. I ended up with what is known as Afghan Kush. We went to the house of a friend and rolled up a smoke of the Afghan Kush to share with her and her boyfriend. 
51	Within half an hour of smoking this joint we felt a very intense fog settle on us. As I can't speak for everyone else, I  remember the high to be very thick and cloudy. Tobacco (as we all smoked) seemed to have a strange taste like a bonfire and our munchies, Haribo and pizza, tasted very very weird. I recall that the Haribo left a thick coating on my tongue that tasted amazing for a very long time. 
52	Around 3 - 4 hours after finishing the smoke, we slowly passed out watching a horror film which I would NOT recommend others try. Somehow I didn't have nightmares but watching the horror film was essentially self inflicting paranoia on myself. 
53	Strong buzz from a shared joint left me in no doubt as to the potency of this strain.
54	Very pleasant and euphoric-watch-the-world-go-by feeling.
55	Extreme munchies and dry mouth. I blame this single event for the reasons behind a filling (courtesy of the amount of Dr.Pepper I drank!). 
56	Easy to turn to a bad high if in the wrong environment.

59	It was a casual party with several friends, and we had just puffed a couple drags off of a shitty apple pipe. Some were drinking, but I was satisfied with the marijuana. As they were making noise downstairs, I was zoning out on a couch in the upper level. Eventually, I began what can only be explained as 'eating the sun'.
60	At first it seemed like nothing but a funny illusion at first, but as I thought about it later, I began to see the symbolism in it. I was thinking that it was now dark outside because I had eaten the sun as a result of innocent fun. Then it hit me: we  humans are eating away at the world around us. As we indulge in material goods to satisfy our greedy urges for what we percieve is happiness, we are destroying the true source of beauty and joy: our planet earth.
61	As it was now the night, dark and cold, I worried that it would stay this way. If we continue to harm the planet, it would be nothing but a dark and cold hell. Perhaps our destructive tendencies could even result in the sun itself ending prematurely. Everything seemed to connect, and that day I developed an even greater respect for the environment and nature than I already had. The following morning was perhaps the greatest part, for to my relief the sun had not been eaten.

72	This trip was the best I've ever experienced on weed.  It was so intense yet, so relaxing.  It first started when I rode my bike over to my friends house still a little high.  Then we got buzzed at the house and had a cigarette or two.  Then his dealer came over and rolled us a fat joint.  We were so excited that we ran into the garage and got ready to hotbox this small ass little plymouth.  My friend took first hit then me.  9 hit's later I was laughing uncontrollably.  Then we calmed down and hit the bowl in my pipe.  I got three hits and was finally out.  By this time I was very blown and things I've never experienced before started to happen.  I started to see everything in red.  Then I looked at my friend and he look like a rubber tree with moving branches.  I thought the weed might have been laced, so I aksed him and he said no.  So we decided to go back into the house and this is where I started laughing uncontrollably again.  My friends suggested filming me and putting me on Guinness for ''most fucked up''.  But I said I'll pass  After I stopped laughing for like a half hour straight I laid down on the floor and everything just seemed like I was in total paradise.  I felt so free and so connected with myself that I just wanted to explode in joy and happiness.  I started to get hungry so I got some pizza and everyone else got Burger King.  I ate about 4 slices of pizza and then just went into a complete state of oblivion.  I listened to no one.  I was having the time of my life.  I cared about nothing.  I was like this for about 2 hours going in and out of this and other different states. I was too stoned to remember much but all I can tell you is that this was a life changing experience and may be too intense for some.  Overall I had a great time and I'm looking forward to being stoned this much again.

75	The first time I ever smoke weed I was when I was 15.  I was going to be home alone for about an hour, so I decided to take my ounce and brand new bong out for a test run.  I loaded a heavy bowl, smoked, and felt nothing.  But I was determined.  I smoked another bowl, and thought I wasn't high, but then stood up off my patio chair, and immediately plopped back down again.  The whole backyard swirled and I realized how much had smoked.  I walked back inside just as my parents pulled up the driveway, so I hid the bong and the rest of my stash in my room, and collected myself enough to go get a snack and BIG glass of cold water.  All I wanted was some water and chocolate chip cookies.
76	I threw in a movie (The Big Lebowski) and hung out for awhile.  By the time the movie ended I had eaten the entire box of cookies, and since it was about 11:00, everyone was asleep.  So I snuck back outside and smoked another bowl.  Now I felt on top of the world and very energetic.  I got my little brother (10 yrs old) to play tag with me in the house at 11:00 at night.  The next morning I woke in my bed, cookie crumbs and bottled water all over my room.  My brother said later to me that day that I was acting crazy last night.  I couldn't believe I got so high.
77	Ever since this experience, I've smoke weed atleast once a month with my friends just to hang out.  The best people to smoke with are ones who like good music, and are experinced smokers.  They'll keep you talking and ensure you have a good time. 
78	It's also good to be friends with some small-time dealers because A. I get the real hook-up and discounts, and B-they can always get me good shit and will never turn down a chance to smoke with me.  It's always fun to get a big circle together and pass around five or six pieces at once.  Everybody gets real high and someone always has something fun to say or do.

80	Cannabis (1) : General (1), First Times (2), Retrospective / Summary (11), Various (28)
81	It was on December 4th 2004 and I had decided to do some weed with a 'cousin' of mine. I hadn't done any for over a year and was really excited. He brought some really expensive KB and while we were in his car at night around 9 p.m. we decided to do it in a crappy little side-street. I took the glass pipe and took 1-1/2 hits and it tasted really strong and bad. I opened the door and threw up a little. After a few seconds I felt sick and opened the door and threw up some more. My cousin asked me if I was OK and I said that it just tasted bad and that I didn't want to do anymore.
82	Once we started to ride off the street lights started to feel like they were blinking and time would go on strangely. Every other second would skip. I didn't think I would get high but I did (it must have been some strongass bud). Then I immediately fell into this trance that I will never ever forget. I slumped over in my seat and fell into this coma-like state. I started have memories from long ago come back (early early childhood)! I started to think that life was all one big dream and everything is a pattern and that I've already lived this life and will live it again and again. I thought that maybe I had this feeling every time I got high and that I just don't remember. Whenever I had a thought another idea would come over it and make me forget. I would come up with a conclusion in my head about life, the universe and everything and why this was happening to me but another thought would come over that and tell me that it's all a dream, but then another thought would tell me that that was a dream too. This would happen for what seriously felt like millions of years. I was very frightened yet I could not do anything.
83	We drove to a theater but when I got out I was acting and walking like a very drunk person so we went back in the car. When I put my seatbelt on or tried to take it off I couldn't and it felt like I did it hundreds of times. Everything I did would repeat and it was very annoying and frightening. My cousin told me that I passed out for a while and then I threw up on myself a whole shitload. I remember parking at a grocery store and waiting for him to buy paper towels, it felt like hours and I kept on looking around for cops (I have been arrested twice for possession and it was the worst things that ever happened to me and ever since I've been very paranoid). Once he came back he got me out of the car and cleaned it up and cleaned me up the best he could. I remember looking at him as a father figure (I don't know my biological father, but I don't normally think about him). We decided to go home and sleep.
84	When I saw my dad (not biological) I tried to talk as normal as I could but he noticed I was acting weird and asked me what was wrong. I told him I felt car sick and the macaroni I ate was bad, then I rushed to the bathroom and threw up. My dad heard me throwing up but I tried to convince him I was just a little sick. Then my cousin and I went downstairs to sleep and I immediately went to sleep on the sofa with my contacts and shoes and everything on. I fell asleep immediately. In the morning I was fine, but I kept on thinking about the night before over and over in my head.
85	Ever since (it's been a few months) I think about that night every day a few times a day and wonder what the fuck had happened. It was by far the most frightening yet interesting and enlightening moment in my life. I will never forget it. I don't know why it happened, whether it was because it was KB, or because I hadn't done weed in a long time or because I was scared and slightly depressed at the time. I promised to never to drugs again but that's bullshit because for 4/20 I bought some regular weed and have done it and it was like the old days (nothing weird). I also did Morning Glory seeds last night and the same thing almost happened to me once I entered a car. I can't fully explain what all I felt and thought that night but I wish everyone could experience some time in their lives. I had a kind of epiphany, I now am pretty sure I will grow up to be a world leader (maybe The World Leader)! It reminded me of Mein Kampf and what Hitler said happened to him after he got gassed in WW1. I lover marijuana and other drugs and hope they will be around for ever and that I can keep on doing them. I don't ever want that experience of Dec. 4th to happen to me again because I felt like I was stuck in it forever and forever. I will probably write a book about some time in my life if I can do it accurately.

88	 When I was growing up I always thought I would be the one person who would never try drugs. In eigth grade I was 'straight edge' The one night my cousin Shaunna was over. She is two years older than me and has tried many difftent drugs. My neighbor Tom used to grow his own weed and told me if I ever wanted to get high then I was welcome to come over. 
89	One night Shaunna was staying the night at my house and since it was so nice out we decided to sleep in my tent on our pool deck. At around one AM she suggested we go over to Toms and get high because she hadn't had any sine she moved down here two months ago. I agreed and we made sure my parents were asleep and jumped my fence and climbed rock stairs to Tom's house. He answered the door and knowing what we were there for led us too his back room.
90	I was feeling pretty nervous as I watched him pack a bowl. Shaunna told me to calm down and that I might not even feel much of anything since this was my first time. (By the way whoever came up with that dumb theory that you don't get high your first time is crazy) I took a couple of hits and I wasn't really feeling anything. Then when Shaunna went to go take her hit she put the bowl in to her mouth and tried to light the other end. I started laughing and I could not stop. I was laughing for at least a couple of minutes. I felt so happy and relaxed like nothing in the world could hurt me. 
91	At around four we decided to get back. This was the hard part. Like I said before we had to walk up the makeshift rock stairs and jump a fence to get back to my yard. I was behind Shaunna walking down the stairs and I tripped and we both ended up falling the rest of the way. We layed at the edge of the fence just giggling to ourselves and looking at the stars. Shaunna jumped the fence first and had no problems then it was my turn. Getting to the top wasn't bad but getting back down turned out to be a lot harder than it should have been. I ended up sitting at the top of the fence for about five minutes just laughing because it fasinated me that I could not get down.
92	When we finnaly got back to our tent we ate some chips and drank some Mountain Dew but everything tasted like chicken to me. (I have never had that feeling again) After our snack we just layed and after about fifteen minutes of talking about nothing we fell asleep.
93	Ever since then I have been an avid pot smoker. I am lucky I had a good first experiance with pot because I know a lot of people who didn't.

96	I've been a regular pot smoker for several years now and have always enjoyed its benefits both therapeutic and entertaining but just a few days ago I had one of the most unpleasant highs I've ever had in my life. One day out of curiosity I ingested about a half eighth of dried buds and to my surprise I didn't feel anything for the first hour. After the hour passed by I started having a pounding headache and every visual/sound I could see/hear irritated me a lot. Several minutes later I ran to the bathroom and started throwing up uncontrollably and then this paralized feeling overtook me. I could feel my buddy vibrating and getting heavier so I just laid down next to the toilet bowl with an agonizing headache without being able to move. A few minutes later I heared some noises and decided to try and sleep over my pain, so I headed to my room and just laid down on my bed with the lights off. The headache dissapeared and a few minutes later I fell asleep. The next morning I could feel a slight buzz and promised myself never to ingest so much cannabis again. Laying down and shut the lights off seemed to alleviate my pain to a certain degree.

99	Im now nervously flipped out in my bed wondering what has happend am I real?? Is anything real?? Is the music that is currently flooding into my de-activated flood gates real?? All this comming at once the thought of my burning stomach thinking that food poisoning be the only explaination in my simple confused paranoid mind.
100	Next im able to think but not able to control my body, where is my body taking me to, why can I only think and not feel or control my movement, (blank)(10mins which seems 200yr's later). My body stumbles to flip the switch of negative light. (thought returning to normal)
101	Oh jeez my stomach  (blank) ok theres the toilet goddammit I cant puke Im gonna die(blank)Now I have returned unknowingly to my domain where the box of flickering light is stored (strobe light) and the blanket of light containment is all set for visual abstraction.
102	Next I put my black blanket over my whole body not letting any light out. Then I combine the light emitter (strobe at full speed) with the blanket of light containment to bounce the light off the non stable fabric that is now a psychadelic tunnel of illusionary destruction in the form of purple red white and blue and some black and mostly grey. Sooner my mind drifts I close my eyes remove my glasses and stretch my eyelids with my eyelid muscles to make it so the skin blocking this visual box of madness thinner to make a snowy tv effect which soon turned of images of hell spawns with greenish grey wings and red eyes with various very detailed weapons and the whole time this is happening Im introduced to satanic sounds and sights which I dont go to church but yet still believe in heaven because its pretty stereotypical so to sum it up the mad flashing strobe is pulsing my mind and making fire shapes and weird illusions that where mostly dream like and un describable.
103	Next I came out of the blanket turned off my Kid-A cd and return to reality with me myself and my LAVA LAMP omfg the swirls of liquady green encrypt my mind with confusion so instinct pulls the plug out. Last for some reason I turned back on the flashing box from hell and have this very real clear image of my brain in front of me and this cold liquad metal being pushed through the top of it like forced through a small playdough cutter and filling up my black and white brain all while this is happening a very real feeling of what im seeing then(Blank). Morning.
104	P.S. what I learned from this experience was that this high is very hard to make happen again without very good funding and that marijuana is more than what people think.

107	Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] 
108	One day me and my friend C were going to smoke some weed like we did every so often. I had bought a dime the day before.
109	Smoking it came with an unusual set of effects. Shortly after we had smoked it we were both seeing little slivers or crystals in our vision. It looked like everything we saw was broken down into little slivers. Also our hearing was incredibly strong.
110	We think it might have been laced, but it is probably just really strong stuff. I know from experience that there are all different kinds of weed, but this was something else.

113	I am a college student who smokes marijuana every day. And I don't mean I have a bowl every night, I mean I smoke a lot of chronic often. My tolerance is without question extremely high. That said, last night I took a hit of hash through a hash piece. It was a good 7 second hit of incredible hash. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I had to immediately sit down I was so wrecked.
114	Then it got interesting. First, I was able to hear every conversation in a room. Its like my selected hearing didn't exist. I felt like I was getting sensory overload, similar to tripping.
115	Twice during a 3 hour period I felt like I was in a different place. The first time I imagined hard a future event, but it felt so real. The next time I had an incredibly real flashback to events from a few years ago. All this time I was still able to converse with friends in the room. 
116	Once it finally died down I realized without a doubt this was one of the craziest highs of my life. It was like one of the first times smoking again.

119	It was the 4th of July and I went to my good friend, Robert's house for the night.  When I got there he was packin' a bowl.  I had smoked weed before, but I NEVER thought weed could do this to me.  I smoked that bowl with him and I felt a 'normal' high (reality seen as a picture show, etc.) within a very short amount of time.
120	We watched the infamous, stoner's favorite movie, 'Half Baked.'  Our friend Kris came over after that and we smoked another bowl.  Then I put one together and we smoked it (I make a TIGHT bowl!).  Afterwards, we WALKED to Kris's house and I felt like I was floating, like my feet weren't touching the ground.  I didn't talk much either..I don't think I talked at all really.  But we got to Kris's house and went to the basement where the band equipment is set up and all.
121	Robert started playing guitar and it echoed in my head as I sat on the l33t0 couch watching Kris messing with the sound.  We decided to go upstairs, stairs, not a good idea, they don't look real.  When we got up there they supplied me with my own water bong to toke up on, plus Robert brought his bowl and Kris had Robert's water b-iz-ong too.  I smoked mine, and helped them smoke their's.
122	You know when you over-focus your eyes and everything gets blurry?  Well that's what happend, but it was constantly.  I just sat there and watched TV.  I didn't blink.  That's not even the beginning of the story though.  I got home at around 12midnight (my mom picked me up).  The next morning I had to get up at 6:30 to go to Hershey Park with my friend, Jamie.  Even though the high was pretty much gone, I still didn't feel 'myself'.
123	Everything that happened felt like a dream 5 minutes (or so it seemed) later.  We rode ALL of the rollercoasters and none of them scared me.  I was just like, 'Let's go for it.' Because I had no remembrance of it afterwards.  I saw a picture of me on one of the coasters and I was all 'zoned out' like I was just sitting at home like a lazy ass as usual.  I'm kind of upset that I got to miss the reality of the Amusement Park being that I don't get to go to them often.  But the feeling was great!  I had to literally hold on to Jamie because I wasn't aware of where I was, what I was doing, or where I was going.  The munchies hit me later though and I had to pay $20 in Hershey for a pizza!
124	This really didn't wear off until later that night when I was getting ready to go to sleep.  I must say it was great, but I wouldn't choose weed as a 'choice drug'. I like to know how reality works, I want to be able to dig deep into everything when I'm on a drug.  That's why I now choose to do Amphetamines as opposed to forgetting things and acting dumb.  But that's another story.  Everything is Eventual.
125	P.S.  My mom never knew that I was high, but the other night when one of my other friends stayed the night.  She thought we were high as hell and it took a lot of convincing for her to believe that we weren't.

128	The set and setting was saturday night, alone, off my meds (Risperidone, escitalopram and divalproex) and I was playing video games. Someone online told me they were tripping on DXM and I wanted to level up so I took one big rip. 
129	I set my pipe down and the effect started with a build up of euphoria that couldn't get stronger when my brother walked in my trailer and startled me and I told him I'm really high and all I was experiencing was ETERNALNESS and he laughed. He wanted too borrow my pipe and we couldn't find it so were going on a trip trying too find it when I joke maybe it dissolved into the cosmic void! When he found it and we started having a talk which I barely remember, he walked out we said our yadda yadda goodbyes. 
130	I walked outside smoking a cigarette and I felt like my thoughts were a bunch of fishes in the sea of awareness who's liquid was changed to weed juice and like the mind was a totally maluable object, and that I am a lightbulb of awareness as we all are. My high settled down and I wrote this in my journal midway between a buzz and a high.

132	I had just smoked weed with a bunch of my friends earlier. I came home pretty late and thought I should try to fall asleep. I usually masturbate before going to bed to help me relax. To me, masturbating baked is just Divine. I was going through the usual things I fantasize about and I also recently saw The Dark Knight. I started fantasizing about the Joker, imagining myself as his evil sidekick/lover. I was trying really desperately to get off but it just wasn't working. I thought to myself, 'hey, I tell everyone I'm bisexual, why don't I think about some chicks?' I started imagining myself having lesbian sex with a girl who was a cross between Harley Quinn (the Jester Girl) and Catwoman. Then somehow they both morphed into me and I was literally fucking myself like two clones. Then as I orgasmed it dawned to me. The only way you can truly know if your gay is if you get off on the opposite sex, which I did for the first time. I've fooled around with girls before and I'm very open about my sexuality but this was the first time I imagined such a scenario on my own. Any girl could just kiss another and proclaim she was bisexual, but in reality that doesn't mean shit. What I had was a profound enlightening experience. It was truly amazing and one of the best sexual/spiritual experience I've ever masturbating alone.

135	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
136	The first time I smoked I didn't feel anything. I can always remember what happens when I smoke. I never lose memory. Maybe time but never memory. My boyfriend showed it to me when I was in college. I was never pressured into it, I was always offered as something polite but was never chastised for declining. After a few times I let my body start slipping into what I guess I call high space. I love being outside when I'm high, the stars seems so much brighter, better somehow. I love to get lost in them. Music changes my high, it shakes my body and makes me smile a lot. When I am high I am not paranoid, scared, nor do I freak out. I smile a ton! I laugh, I can dance, and drive. The great part about my being high is the calm I feel. I also love the body tingle I get. Small movements feel like a wave of motion, it's really quite amazing. Being high is definitely better with friends, even if they don't smoke with you. Its nice to be around people.

138	A kind patron of the arts brought my band a sheet of cookies and a sheet of brownies both made with cannabutter to eat while recording a song. I hadn't eaten anything that day, and very little the day before, so I ate half of the cookies, and half of the brownies. The two batches of baked good had been made with 1 lb of cannabutter total, and each lb of cannabutter contained 1/4lb of trim, so I effectively ate somewhere in the range of an eighth of a pound of pot within the span of a few hours. 
139	Long story very short, my world was spinning non-stop, I felt very very nauseous (a few dry heaves but no vomiting) and I was capable of sleeping absolutely anywhere (and oh boy, did I sleep). Smoked a few bowls, and I was just thrown over the edge. Band recorded the whole damn song without me, and I didn't even remember what it sounded like in the morning. 
140	On the whole, not really suggestible if productivity is in mind. It was sort of fun, albeit, incredibly intense and a day down the drain (and I do mean the whole, 24 hour day).

143	We had a gram of hash that was hard to scrape into filings for smoking.  I've always been adverse to smoking anything, so I suggested we try making hash tea.
144	We wrapped the cube in a cloth and smashed it with a hammer with one blow.  There being four of us I heated 4 cups of water in a saucepan to a boil, reduced heat to a simmer, and added the crushed cube.  Unscientifically, I simply let it simmer until an amber colour developed, which was about 30 minutes.
145	I portioned the brew into the cups and we sipped slowly as we conversed.  It tasted slightly bitter but actually it was rather good.  At first, we thought the experiment was a failure.  But, as we continued to socialize there came a point within 30-60 minutes where we realized that we were already in an altered state.  It sort of crept up on us unawares. Most pleasant.

148	One night me and a few buddies were just driving and we decided to head on over to a buddies house to smoke some.  About an hour before we went over to his house, I smoked a bowl by myself of some pretty dank stuff.  Anyways so we go over there and I've never smoked out of a bong before so I take 4 good hits and WOW I've never ever felt like that before in my life.  So we walk to the dude's car to chill in and all of a sudden my heart starts beating so fucking fast.  This freaks me out.  At this point I didn't know weed could do that so I was like what the hell was that we smoked?  Well the dude says it was laced w/ PCP.....at this point I freak out on him and start yelling and shit but he says he was just kidding.  So at this point I could barely concentrate and my throat felt like it was trying to close(??) or something like that.  Scary.  I pretty much felt like I was going to die so I got very very scared.  So they drop me off at my house and it feels like I'm in a foreign place.  I try to eat a swiss cake and I can't even get it down because my mouth is so dry.  When I went to sleep that night I thought I was going to die.  I wake up the next day for school and I'm not high but I'm really like anxious and jumpy and all this.  My body felt realyl weird like all tense for the next week or so but then it went away.  Was it laced with PCP??? I don't know.  I don't think I want to know either.  All I know is that pot is more potent than some people think.  I've had a lot of fun with pot before but that fun was because I'd get stoned and all it would do is make me chill out and enjoy food and music a lot more but this was nothing like that.

151	I have been in a family where all my brothers have smoked weed. I have always wanted to know what it felt like and it was very easy to get in a small town where there was nothing to do but smoke or get wasted. My neighbor had been a smoker for years and he had just got this bong. He asked if I wanted to do some and like any curious kid would do I gladly accepted.
152	I lit the bowl, I lifted it up, and a sudden rush of smoke came into my lungs and killing my brain. I am happy to report that it was a magnificent feeling even though I almost threw up. After I took the one single hit I was 'high'. I knew I was high because when I walked into his house everything as I have seen before was in a different perspective. We sat on the couch to watch this funny movie. Then next thing I know I was eating a bowl of Fruit Loops laughing extremely harder than usual. It was late so I went home. On the way to my house I heard a train. It was if I was standing right next to it. I also heard birds right next to me. I stood outside for a while because my parents were still awake and I was way too messed up for them to see me. Finally when my parents fell asleep I went inside when my brother walked by me and said,'your high aren't you'. I didnt lie to him. He took me into his room and showed me a 'blunt'. We both went outside to smoke it and when I went inside I had a different 'high'. I sat on my couch not laughing and acting wild but I was calm and cool. I was in love with the way this green substance made me feel. I now stand here today and can proudly say I do not regret lighting up my first bowl of weed.

155	While I was on my 10 day leave after boot camp and before combat training, I stupidly decided to smoke marijuana knowing I would receive a urinalysis at the end of it.  About 4 or 5 days into leave I shared a bowl of mid-grade cannabis between two friends and myself.  At 8.5 days (1.5 days before test!) I was intoxicated from alcohol and took 2 hits from a joint of low grade cannabis.  Needless to say I felt like a complete idiot the next day.
156	From this point on I began drinking more water than usual and I purchased a 40 dollar system-cleansing drink from a vitamin shop.  I did not exercise or do much physical activity during this time.   I consumed the drink about 7 to 9 hours before the test, and drank a moderate amount of water after this.  About 30 minutes before the test I drank a large amount of water. When I took the test my urine was almost clear.
157	I passed the test and I am grateful for it.  I think I was lucky considering the short time between smoking and the test.

160	Before starting the report, I'd like to say that I dont have a very advanced english, so sorry about that.
161	Friday night, around 9pm, I was hanging out with friends, playing gta 5 and smoking some cigarretes, pretty chill, so we decided is was a good idea to meet with a friend who had cannabis, before we left the house We drinked some vodka, I drank 1 big shot, all my friends drank the same, and we left.
162	We reached this friend house around 10:35 pm and before started smoking, we had a beer, I almost drank it all myself, then we started smoking. I smoked 2 big hits of a very low quality weed (I'm from Argentina and having dank buds its extremely expensive, normally we smoke this thing we call 'prensado'). It took around 2 minutes to hit. 
163	10 minutes after it hit I was totally baked, barely could walk, and only could only say around 3 words, I think its important to say that I dont smoke regularly and I have a really low tolerance to THC, however this never happened to me, at the moment I was feeling extremely paranoid and my thoughts were very slow. I had to stop to rest a little bit on every block, it was imposible to walk in a straight line. My friends were helping me to walk, we had to walk around 25 blocks to reach my home. 
164	All my memories after we started walking just dissapeared, I remember I asked the hour a couple times, first time I asked it was 10:50, second time it was 12:35 am. My time perception was really distorted, and I dont know exactly why it took us so long to reach my home. When we reached my home I said goodbye to my friends and entered my home, I could not fucking describe how beautifull it was to throw myself to bed, all the paranoia was gone, it was all solved, it was beautiful. I eat something and sleeped feeling like god. 
165	The morning after I was still really buzzy, and wondering why the fuck 2 hits of a low quality joint hit me that much.

168	Walking home after smoking so much weed I felt like I was a big system, I felt like I was a robot so I had to consciencely tell my legs where to go with each step feeling like a earthquake of euphoric sensations.
169	After a minute I had audial hallucinatons. Sounding like waves of a harp like noise plus some weird bass/beat all in sync.  I was walking a few miles with fattest grin of my life, (this wasn't my first time or anywhere near) I tried to grab my face and physically change the smile, my face felt like rubber, I couldn't  remove the smile I was too happy. 
170	When I arrived home I made some cereal because munchies, it tasted a lot more intense and I could feel the chewing more.  I turned a call of duty game on and was utterly destroying the other team without even thinking hard, it was like my subconscious was focusing on the game  like my life depended on it but consciously I was in space, one of my best highs in my life,

173	I was just playing rummy and listening to some music with my brothers. We smoked two good bowls, 1 from each of us. I don't smoke often so I really felt it rip me up tonight. I felt like we were floating over the rummy cards as were if we were the cards being put down also! It was hard to concentrate and keep focus. I played a few wrong moves over the games due to going to space at the moment. Then I would laugh after realizing it and my brother would be unimpressed. We both would laugh at a few things over the games. I felt like I was on clouds. I do not feel like moving. I have a light feeling and getting ready to go to bed to float to some music while I drift off. phew was baked! I still am as I write this short after this experience. I am so relaxed now. Good times.

176	Weed is really the only drug I've tried. No hard drugs or anything like that. Now I'm 15...
177	Its a school night, I finished all my homework, so why not smoke a few bowls (out of a homemade bong thing)? I did that, and just sort of read a book until I felt it. When I did feel it I was a little jittery and couldn't focus on the book. I felt like just lying down, so I turned off the lights and did that.
178	At this point I felt calm and relaxed. I put on my earphones and listened to the band 'Rush' for quite a while. The feeling is amazing. Just complete bliss, and listening to meaningful music. I was transfixed in a way... Just lying down, sometimes touching my face because it felt soft for some reason, and enjoying the music. I laugh about me singing loudly to that music now, but I immensely enjoyed it. This just continued until I fell asleep.
179	This has never happened before when I smoked.. and it hasn't happened since. But it was one of the best times smoking, and I hope I can achieve it again sometime.

181	I will make this short. One night me and my friends got a hotel room and decided to kick it. Me and my friends smoked the whole blunt and start drinking again. One of my friends curled up and went to bed almost immediately after smoking the joint, the other one kindda lay down on the bed. Approximately 5 minutes after smoking I felt this intense rush going through my head and my heart start to beat fast as hell. I could hear my heart pound like crazy. I felt like I was losing my mind and almost wanted to kill myself just to stop what was happening. I couldn't really tell if I was feeling cold or hot, so I hopped in the shower and doused myself with water just to feel cold again so I would turn the water hot , and feel hotter , so I would turn it cold again - I felt like I was in hell lol. It finally wore off after a couple hours. It was one of the scariest moments of my life, I hate to lose control of myself so I will let off the weed for a while. thanks for reading

184	I have just smoked a bowl and as I am beginning to feel the warm onset of dope pleasure I am thinking about what Marijuana has done to me. I've only been smoking for a year and-a-half, but my life has definitely changed since that first waterfall. My taste in music has become broadened, I am a calmer person. I feel more generous and loving towards my friends. I think that in general it has made me a better person. I can see the beauty in everything, from a butterfly on a flower to the view of a night city from high up. However I do feel that Anti-Motivational Syndrome is a real thing, but I have tried to be a 'responsible' user and  always tried to complete my studies. 
185	I had smoked weed on a couple of occasions before I decided to cook with pot. My friend 'K' had told that when you eat your pot you get a much different high than if you had smoked it, and I was eager to experiment. I searched the web for an easy recipe, and I found one that involved crackers and peanut butter. I chopped a fairly large nug (about 2 grams) of silver haze into fine shake, spread the crackers with peanut butter, and sandwiched the weed between them. I wrapped the 'Firecrakers' in foil, and heated them over a gas stove for a good ten minutes. After they were cooked, I popped one in my mouth and waited. After thirty minutes I felt nothing, so I ate the other sandwich.
186	About an hour after eating the first sandwich, it hit me HARD. I was watching Chappelle's show, And I noticed that I had an arm like a cat's. My watch became a stripe, my hair was fur, and my fingers were claws! I had never experienced anything like this after smoking, this was amazing. My high continued escalating to the point where I could not get up out of my bed, my legs had become part of the bed, like they melted together. about six hours after ingesting my first cracker, my parents came home,and I was still high. My mother came to say goodnight, and I was barely able to utter goodnight. I slipped into deep sleep and to my amazement, when I awoke, I was still fucking high. After sixteen amazing hours I started to come down. This was an experience to remember.

190	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
191	Well, one day in July, I was at my swim club. I meet a guy. W got to talking and he said he had some dank nugs in his car. I agreed and threw in 5 dollars to compensate the cost. We approached his car. He packed the biggest glass bowl I had ever seen. We got to smoking. I didnt feel high towards the end. As soon as I got out of the car. That was when it all kicked in. My Beautiful vision of a bright day turned into a dark night. I got on my bike, and began to ride home. The color of the sky was changing with multiple different colors. As soon as I got to my home I realized that the high was extremely unmanagable. I went to my room,  turned on the tv and layed down. I watch a episode of family guy. As soon as I turned of the tv, I turned my head and my vision faded behind me. I closed my eyes for a little while. When I opened them up, I saw clocks all over my wall, everywhere. I went to sleep and that was it.

194	So here is the story I had quit smoking marijuana for about 6 months for probation and I was very excited about being able to smoke again.  A couple of my friends and I got together because we were all going of to college or starting to work.  So my buddy picked up a cople grams of purple haze and we used my buddy's bong that had an ice catcher which we filled with ice.  So we passed the bong around once and we each took our hit and started coughing like crazy and all of of a sudden I started puking my brains out.  I couldn't stop throwing up for a good 10 minutes and then I came back and sat down.  I took another hit and I began dry heaving for about 5 minutes really bad and then my body just went limp, I felt as if I were paralyzed.  But overall all I could say to my boys is  'thats some good weed' (thats what I said when I came back from puking).

197	I skipped out on class and went with some friends to smoke some weed. We were 4 and we smoked about 6 grams in total.
198	It was all fun and we were laughing for the first hour or two. Then 2 of my friends went home and me and the other guy went to mall to get something to eat.
199	After we ate, we went out for a cigarette through the emergency fire escape door. After we finished the cigarettes, he left to go home, I started walking to take the city bus.
200	I started to feel really heavy, I couldn't even scratch my head because my arm felt so heavy. I started to sweat but at the same time I was feeling really cold, I could barely see anymore, I could only see one thing and the backround was all black. For example, I would look at a car and it would be all I see nothin else. 
201	I just sat down next to the wall and curled up into a ball and just watched people pass by for about 2 hours.
202	When I got home I just passed out on the couch.

204	Last summer I was 14 (I am 15 about to turn 16 in 2 months) I tried weed for the first time and I loved it I laughed hours on end. After this experience I smoked more often about a few times a month. February of this year I started hanging out with this girl who bought a dime to 3 20's a day we would finish all of it and be high for hours I would go to her apartment EVERY single day and smoke and I love the feeling of being high from Marijuana. It is now July 2004 and I haven't been sober since February.
205	I have to smoke at least once a day or I get depressed and get in a pissed off mood I mean I know Marijuana isn't physically addictive but I'm addicted in a psychological way. Everytime my high comes down I always say I need more wanting to keep the high going of course. I have had other experiences with other drugs such as Alcohol, Shrooms, LSD, PCP, Coke, Xanax & Vicodin and I find Marijuana to have the best effects on me.

208	I can hardly sleep. At the time of the report I was working 12 hours daily next to university studies.
209	T 00:05 -- 200mg hash in shisha continously for 30 minutes 
210	T16:58 Bit pressure in stomach, active tiredness.
211	More than an hour of sleep close state. Can't perceive any sense of time. Sometimes waking up to the fact that my breathing had turned to be manual.  This occassion is covered with some kind of dream like vision of people entering the door. Numb hands, heavy heart rate, motorical funcions on.  I can hold the bottle but only with visual feedback. After drinking some water less physical hardness. 
212	4 hours of sleep with vivid dreams about people entering the door - leaving me sedated. Consciousness takes over about 3 times, dreaming patterned thought flows while awake.  After another 4 hours of sleep, waking up dizzy sober.

215	Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] 
216	Last night I smoked some weed laced with, I didnt know at the time, PCP. This bong was crazy it costed well over 400 dollars and all I needed was one hit to send me flying around. I started to get a little confused/shocked feeling in about five minutes but the real effects didnt set in until about 15 minutes later. Normally I am a fun, giggly, talkative person when I am high but this was much different and I knew right away this wasnt just any weed. 
217	Sumblime was playing and it felt as if the room was swaying to the music and it wouldnt stop, almost like being drunk but in a weird way. I also found that during this time my throat was hurting intensely, it felt so dry but no matter what I would drink I could NOT quench it. I remember describing to my friend that my throat kept 'going up in the back all tight.' I think that I must have been clenching it or something I have no idea.
218	I spent a lot of time last night trying to sort myself out, trying to come down a little and figure out if I was acting weird and what my body was doing. But only after my friend pointed it out I realized my whole entire body was shaking and my feet felt like they were in small pools of water. (Now that I think back on it I might have been cold but I remember feeling hot.) I then convinced myself that my foot was asleep and thats why I was feeling so out of it and I kept telling my friends ' I figured it out, I figured it all out.' My body felt extremely disconnected, which made me feel a little bit stupid because I couldn't really control myself. 
219	Then about 30 minutes into it I felt drenched, I thought someone poured water on me but I wasnt sweating or anything. Then I sit up straighter and realized that everything looked so weird, I felt like we were in some sort of production like a music video. Then I got scared that everyone was judging me and thought I was the only fucked up one, I kept asking if anyone else hit the bong. I no longer felt in place, I felt outcasted and started to worry about every little move I made, I didnt want to look stupid. Then all of the sudden I just decided that I needed to cheer myself up so I said 'guys we have to think positively you shouldnt care what people think about you' apparently it was a really random statement because everybody got a real laugh but it really helped my trip get better.
220	After I started to settle myself down all I could think about was birthday cake, I had a bad craving to go to the grocery store and just explore but I had to go home. When I got up I felt a huge head rush because I hadn't gotten up that whole time and I felt extremely uncoordinated like I was drunk. 
221	Overall it was a pretty interesting experience that lasted intensely for about 5 hours but I still feel some effects today and last night I didnt sleep at all, or maybe I did. It was weird I couldnt tell if I was sleeping or awake and it didnt help that I went home alone. 
222	Today, I feel a little strange almost like I'm just at the very very end of a normal high. Groggy, incoordinated and a little awkward. And I can honestly say that I do not know how I got home but that my friend drove.

225	One beautiful Thursday night me and my friend...let's call him Jeff...we decided to go for a smoke. So we walked to the local park and when we arrived another 3 of our buds (malcom, des and ryan) showed up out of nowhere. So I asked them 'Are you guys here for the same reason we are?' They nodded. 
226	Malcom pulled out 2 joints each with .5g in them.  We lit them up and passed them around. It was very unusual. It didn't feel strong at first but it had an afterburn. About a minute after I toked I started coughing like crazy. 
227	After finishing both joints we decided to leave the area and continue to a new one. Malcom said we had to find the silver left from captain gold. At this point all 5 of us were completely stoned. This was REALLY good weed. We wanted to hit up my bong but we had no water. I then saw a little puddle of water left from the rain of the previous night. All of us were too stoned to care. So I filled it up and we hit a couple bowls. 
228	We continued walking down the path...I really forget where we went from there...oh ya...we continued down the path and I found a broken tv under a tree. I was very excited at the sight of this. I ran up and tried to rip a piece of the glass out, resulting in me cutting my hands up. 
229	We then found ourselves at a quickie but we only had $1. So we just bought 3 airheads. I forget where we went from there but we somehow ended up at malcom's house and Jeff had vanished. when we got there...we ate.
230	They listened to some music and I sat and thought. The 1st dimension is side to side the 2nd is up and down and the 3rd is forward and back. The fourth dimension is time, which for the moment we'll say time is a line of time, we can go forward in time and perhaps back in time. So the fifth dimension would be side to side on this plane of 'time' and the 6th would be up and down. The thought of this made me feel as if I had just figured something amazing out. Then I thought to myself that this must be the answer to time travel. The rest of the night was spent eating bread, white chocolate chips, mustard and hot sauce. As me Ryan and des walked home, we ran into malcom's older brother in his van. He offered us some sniffing tobacco. We all tried it. It felt kinda minty. I don't remember what happened after that but I remember listening to stairway to heaven by led zeppelin and I could hear the wood of the drum sticks hitting the drums. The next thing I remember I was in english class the next morning. But that must have been the best weed I've ever had. I'm planning to get some more.

232	Some time ago I embarked with fellow students from my University to Amsterdam to sample the local culture. I ended up speaking to another student from Manchester, who introduced me to Super-Skunk at one of the venues in the city. After taking our seats and acquiring a certain amount of the substance, rolled nicely into a 'doobie', I proceeded to smoke the joint. 
233	After a few tokes, I began to feel very odd indeed and very quickly it appeared as if time was going backwards. After that I stumbled back to the hostel, where I was staying, and began to panic. The chemical wore-off after a couple of hours and, thankfully, there was someone there who helped to allay my fears. All-in-all, an awful experience that in retrospect I was very unprepared for. That said, I am still inspired by Aldous Huxleys The Doors of Perception and look forward to experimenting further in the future. The more we understand the effects of all dopes, the better they can be applied in future.

236	I had been smoking every night for about 6 months, and had started smoking about 8 months before this night. I had had a couple 'bad' highs, the first time I really felt the effects, I flipped out to some degree, but it hadn't happened in quite a long time. 
237	I had about 3/4 a gram of some herb that I used to pack a bowl with, I got into my normal position, which is just sitting on my floor next to my open window, so I could blow the smoke out of my window, cause the whole thing was very under the radar, not wanting to get caught. Anyways I smoked most the bowl, and realized I could barely even hold the bowl anymore, and that the last 2 or 3 hits I wasn't even aligning the lighter and bowl correctly. I took this as a sign that I probably had smoked enough for the night. 
238	I must have went through my normal routine of covering everything up and hiding my bowl, but I don't really recall any of it. After this I, to great disappointment, realized that I didn't have my CD player in my room, and was gonna hafta enjoy this high music free. I was getting into bed, and thought I saw lights coming on in the hallway outside my room, which freaked me out, but I tried to remain calm, and go on with going to sleep. I turned out my light got into bed, fully clothed and with a beanie hat on, for some reason, and just sat there. I started to enjoy the music I was listening too, and then realized, there was no music playing, but in my head it was just as real as if I had my CD player on. 
239	at first I enjoyed it, but for some reason, it suddenly freaked me out, then the beanie I had on felt like just billions of needles all poking into my head, I ripped it off, but immidiatly felt the same sensation all over my body, and took off everything but my boxers. During this my heart had started beating very rapidly, and I began thinking unfavorably of death, and it didn't seem altogether out of the question. 
240	The music at some point had then turned into voices and noises. I could hear my whole family outside my door, all knowing I was high as a kite, and then I could hear my door knob rattling and shaking, and knew they were all trying to get in my room, I realized I was shaking uncontrollably, and instantly thought that the best way to avoid getting caught was to play that I was asleep. I became very still, and just waited for the door to open, and my family to burst into my room, but it never came. 
241	I realized none of it was real, and then went through two more similar experiences like the one that had just happened. I finally calmed down, and fell asleep. The odd thing was the next day, I looked back on the experience somewhat favorably, at the time I was terrified, but looking back, I enjoyed it to a degree.

244	Time: A little after sunset, still light out Location: Lawnchair in my backyard
245	So I'm in my backyard, just got home from a good day of blazing and walking around the forest. Decide to grind up a sesh before going inside. Drop two fat bowls out of my bong. Feeling right stoned so I lay my head back on the lawnchair and close my eyes. I instantly notice orange at the bottom of my closed eye vision, which shifts into a large circle, I now realize I am standing on a large orange sphere and can look around, looking up I see more orange spheres which reminded me of planets at the time and decide to jump to one of them, I then continued to jump between planets until I opened my eyes and went inside.

247	I have been smoking marijuana for about 18 months now, so I'd say I have reasonable experience with it. But something really weird happened a few months ago. Me and some friends were hanging out, and we decided to buy some weed. We bought a gram each of this new crazy hydro stuff that was in town at the time. We sat down, and I I whizzed it up, I felt excited that this would be a new experience. How right I was. We passed the bong around, and afterward I realized I should have only had 1 cone and waited, but had 3 in succession. It kicked in hard. I felt my face go cold, I was laughing hysterically, almost passing out. But did I stop there? NO. I smoked the rest of my gram.
248	I could not feel below my neck. I was kinda scared that I was paralyzed. Then I started rubbing my head against the couch and it was burning so I thought my hair was on fire.
249	All in all it was a crazy night. Still fun but crazy.

251	Cannabis (1) : Overdose (29), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
252	I am an autistic (Aspergers Syndrome) somewhat depressive young lad, or at least I was back in the sober days. My mind seemed like it was on it's own world, of course heavy autism and abusive parenting'll do that to me. I hadn't gotten very many friends, of course the ones I did have I was loyal to, and had known for upwards of 10 years. I was very argumentative and almost insane by most standards, though I had always been incredibly smart.
253	My family didn't seem to mind that I was interested in drugs of all kinds since early childhood. By age 13, my mother dealt LSD in her school girls bathroom and was an intense druggie since age 11. My father was an alcoholic, my step father had tried every drug that I know of, from Cocaine to Crack to Heroin to LSD, he'd been addicted to it at some point in time. My brother's fate was much the same, so it comes as no shock that an interest wouldn't scare them at all.
254	My first dose was on my 13th birthday at 3AM. I was the only one who wasn't drunk, but every time I had gotten drunk at that point I made an ass out of myself, so I wanted to steer clear of alcohol that night. Some of my older brother's friends had the idea to split a joint with me, and I heartily accepted. After 3 hits I was extremely baked. I later found out that my mother was a stoner while pregnant with me as well, so THC had already been introduced into my system years beforehand. I spent the time playing a Prince of Persia game I had received that year, when my ex-druggie brother walked in and asked me how I was feeling. What I was thinking was, 'Pretty good, but my mouth's a bit dry.' whereas what I said was, 'Get the penis outta your bum and start being Jeffrey Dahmer.' I was legendarily baked, and that was clear to my older brother at that point in time.
255	Skip forward to the end of that month where I try to get some weed from an Ecstasy dealer my brother used to go to. I got ripped off obviously, but I later found out that he had actually been chased out of the building by someone he had hit over the head with a wrench earlier that day, and also that some of my brother's friends had beaten him up for ripping me off, and so to repay me at lunch on a monday when I was walking back to school, he handed me a baggie with 0.5 grams of bad hash oil in it. This promptly caused the most awkward school day of my life, because I was in grade 8 and trying to figure out where to hide very potent smelling drugs. I put it in my pocket for the rest of the day, and although every single teacher knew exactly what I was doing and what was in my pocket (the smell of bad marijuana filled the room) but I was so far in every teacher's good books by default for reasons unknown (teachers always have and always will adore me for absolutely no reason) that they never said anything and let me go home at the end of the day without so much as a disapproving glance. My brother promptly taught me how to smoke oil, how to make  a pipe from a water bottle and how to make a bong from a water bottle.
256	Skip forward a week when my weed supply runs out. My brother decided to get me a 1.5 piece as well as hook me up with an amazing dealer, and another less amazing dealer that just so happens to be the drug kingpin of my town. I was planning on requesting instructions on how to roll a joint, but when I tried I succeeded.  Everyone in my family jokes that I inherited the ability to roll a joint from my mother, but I will never be able to roll the perfect joint like my mother can. (They have less imperfections than fucking factory made cigarettes!) From this point on things get royally fucked up!
257	I had started using weed as a coping method for school, and holy shit did I do a lot of it at school! I went to school baked every day for multiple years without exception, and I keep that record even today. At this point, I noticed a few things changed in my life significantly. Puberty is the only thing that compares to how many changes I went through at this stage of my life, only puberty was far more mild and these changes occurred literally overnight. I suddenly realized that I liked music, something that I absolutely hated earlier on in life, and I also noticed that I began to form genuine opinions of things rather than my mind being comprised of mathematics and fucked up algorithms without any real feelings towards anything. I had noticed that I felt genuine emotions and I learned to appreciate the little things in life. Instead of being constantly depressed, I was amused with my life and I was genuinely happy. I had never experienced true happiness before this point. It was truly a miracle.
258	The best trip in my life (no, I've never had a bad trip) happened when my brother's best friend came into town. It was a total shock to him that I had become a total stoner since the last time I had seen him, so as a token of good will (and because he had no way of smuggling that stuff to his new home) he gave me a mini pipe with a built in stash and resin holder (it's an inch long and 4 centimeters thick) and a pipe from Israel. It is by far the most awesome pipe I've ever seen, to this day. To celebrate these new items of mine, we decided to try them out. I smoked a full gram that day. We then went to my room after getting legendarily baked and we went into my room to play Halo. We played it muted, and we listened to every song The Beatles ever wrote. If you think orgasms feel good, you've seen absolutely nothing. Years of pain and depression all seemed to be forgiven when I realized that the world was fucking awesome and not only did all my troubles fade away, but every emotional scar I had received over the course of my life was removed, of course my mind showcased that moment to me during the best riff known to man. (When I'm 64 by the Beatles, the part where Paul goes, 'You'll be older too' is by far the most amazing thing that has ever been recorded in the history of music.) That 3 hour period will forever be known as the best moment in my life never to be topped and forever to be held up high as the meaning of existence and the sole reason life's worth living to the very last second.
259	Weed does have some amusing negative repercussions though, and here are a few of the more embarrassing things that weed has caused. I don't regret them in any way, and looking back on them, I see them as terribly amusing and well worth the price of admission.
260	The first one is one that continues to this day, but basically I would make an account on any website I could find, then go to a random part of the website and proceed to complain about everything being in English (in French) and how they should re-write everything in French. I've been banned so many times, it almost gets hilarious by itself. 
261	 The second time is one day, I had the brilliant idea of smoking 4 joints before going to school. I had been smoking for under a month, (2 weeks to be exact) and I was buying A grade weed. This stuff gets me fucked to this day and it was amazing that I was using that for practice. I went to school and fell asleep leaning against my locker only to be awaken by the Special Ed teacher tapping on my head and telling me I still had 10 minutes left until class. She knew I was on-top-of-the-moon stoned at that point because it was blatantly obvious. The only people who didn't notice were the kids who thought I was just some weird kid, so me being baked just registered to them as me being weird. (Grade 8) I went to my first class which happened to be double science, and I promptly started tripping balls, including a point where I completely forgot what my name was and so I decided I was Patrick Swasy for 10 minutes. The next class was math. We had a test that day, and being fucked beyond any inkling of a doubt kinda impairs my ability to do anything. It was at this point I blacked out and have no idea what happened the rest of the day, but apparently I had two more tests that day, and also apparently I got an A on all three tests I took that day.

263	I have moderate autism (aspergers) and ADHD and smoking weed actually makes life better for me. Sometimes I am socially isolated and rather just be with myself, but some weed every 3-7 days makes me help understand it better. I'll explain one time that was amazing.
264	I pick up my little metal bowl and pack it, savor the smell and realize its only the beginning. I spark the bowl.
265	I am pretty high. I start to notice my surroundings, I stand up and laugh.
266	Wow, I think. It was creeper weed, I underestimated it. I started to notice talking in full sentences was getting to be a challenge, but it was fun. I was becoming more clumsy than I usually am. I am talking to myself like crazy, more than I usually do when I'm not under the influence. 
267	I'm having so much fun letting my imagination go wild with myself, it was like I was sitting there and facing another of me and talking to him. I decide that if I want to have more fun, I'm going to need to smoke some more weed. After that, I'm completely smashed, train wreck in the face.
268	I felt so retarded, as in mentally retarded. I feel so stupid, I felt helpless, but there was that feeling of fun still lingering there. I felt as if this was permanent for about 15 minutes, I was paranoid, but I still felt like it was fun. All of a sudden, my ears are in complete pain. (I have high frequency hearing loss, I cannot hear noises above 7500Khz. Any noise above what I can hear causes me pain.) I faintly remember that I had a dog whistler app on my brothers iPod touch, I must have accidentaly activated it. Fuck me, ouch.
269	T+2:00 I'm still retarded, I could barely talk, though It was hilarious. Anytime I tried to talk, It felt like my mouth kept tripping on its own words, so everything just sounded like jumbled blahs. I somehow managed to go downstairs and make a glass of iced tea. I don't know how I managed to do that the way I was. I started to feel like a kid again. I felt like I had the mentality of a five year old. Wow, It was getting interesting.
270	I'm coming down now, but I still feel good, I'm sitting around thinking about meeting one of my friends, of the few that I have. I thinking about what we were gonna do. (He has autism too but he's 12 so I did not think it would be a good idea to introduce him into the wonderful world of weed, and I did not know how to handle handle him sometimes. You get the point). My mind was drifting and I went to grab a cigarette.
271	Autism and weed are a good mix for me. I've had other things happen but I don't feel like going into detail now. For others its a bad condition but for me, I love it. I never really cared about all the social bs. What I lack in social skills I make up in intelligence, and for me that is 100% true.

273	I was at job corps in San marcos TX. I was bored so me and some friends decided to smoke a joint. I smoked it with little resistance since I love weed. After About 10 minutes I felt the full effect of the weed. I always start to notice colors more when I'm high. It seems like every one is in a spirtual battle. The side they are on is showed by the color they wear. For example red means bloods. Yes I'm talking about the gang. They tend to worship the devil. Blue represents crip. They worship god and want to kill all bloods. Black represents the creater of the universe. When I'm high it's like I'm in a battle. My thoughts are project into other peoples mind. They know exactly what I'm thinking.

276	My friend and I smoked 2 pretty fat joints and were sitting in a parking lot when I had a revalation. What if air distorted images simular to water or heat. So I sat and contemplated for about 20 minutes and came to the conclusion that air causes our eyes to distort but since we have been living so long with air in the atmosphere that we have adapted in the way that fish adapt to seeing through the distorion of water. It would be the exact same if we lived in darkness for the duration of our existence. Our eyes and ears would adapt to the darkness and enable us to move around. This thought process tripped me out in a great way and I enjoyed the rest of my night trying to grab the air and hold it.

279	I baught a sack of schwag one time when I was a n00bie to marijuana, and I was about to go on a road trip.  I didn't have time to smoke the bag, so I poored the weed in my mouth, chewed and swallowed it.  It was about 3 grams I ate.  In about an hour I started feeling stoned.  During the next 8 hours of the trip I passed out several times.  Music sounded great.  When we got to our destination, I wasn't making sense to many people and didn't get a lot of the things they were saying.  I was VERY stoned.  After 10 hours had gone by since I ate it, I passed out for the night.  I felt kind of slow the next day.

282	For over six months I have enjoyed pot tea. I use 1/8 ounce pot and 500 milliliters of water. I bring the water to a rolling boil and boil the pot for 30 seconds. I strain it and let it cool and drink it. If I drink it all I will not drive. I usually drink 250 milliliters. I thought of adding a little corn oil or milk to bond with the thc/cannabanoids.

285	Setting: In my room with computer, when listening to music it's with headphones. I was chatting to a fellow tripper and good friend on MSN he was tripping on different shit, but he knew wot I was going through. room was dimly lit if computer screen is turned off. no-one was physically with me. 
286	Time: Approx 3:00am - 5:45am, I was VERY tired before smoking.
287	Before I start - this was my first time smoking bud (very young leaves with seeds) they have much more THC than normal, which is why only 2.5 cones did it for me. This trip is also quite unusual for cannibus and surprised me alot! All I did was relax and let the ganja take the reigns for a bit... enjoy!
288	-------------------------------------------------------------------
289	Hello, my experiences with Ganja before this day have been merely mellow experiences which get me in a nice comfortable mood, nothing could have prepared me for the MINDBLOWING PERSPECTIVE CHANGING experience this super Ganja gave me. I felt the trees encase my head, my mind. My brain was the soil for the plants, I truly felt that, and I suddenly understood what 'change in conciousness' meant... 
290	I'll start with probably the simplest thing to explain - flying :D. At the very beginning, sitting down (BEST position for tripping) my head was REALLY heavy, yet I was floating. This ain't notin like flying tho! Lets move to third person camera. He's sitting, eyes just fully closed while head tilted down and back bent down. Slowly his head tilts up and back with it, smile widening, eyebrows raising, laughing like he's on one a ride at a theme park. He looks like a damn fewl. hehe.
291	Back to first camera my head continues to raise (note: not I raised my head) back to normal sitting back in my chair position, then further back till I couldn't move it back any further. While my head has been moving back, I have been flying higher and higher. When my head tilted full back I was flying so high!! and I felt the falling/flying sensation, that tension. Hope you know what I mean. Laughing FIT while my head was in full back tilt. Could not stop laughing. Tried to explain it to my friend while having a laughing fit, which eventually reverted to a huge smile. :D
292	At one point I felt my hands were just automatically typing without me thinking, and the computer was responding to my messages. I didn't feel like I was chatting to a person anymore (this computer responding perspective didn't last too long). This is when I felt my mind seperate from my body. They were seperate entities with separate purposes. I had a vision of my dark mind and my dark body (separate), my mind remotely telling my body what to do. Wierd, hard to explain feeling. But it was actually quite profound. I would've thought a spirit/body separation would be more likely, which was half why it felt quite strange indeed. 
293	I felt a bit closer to the dude I was talking to while tripping, I started calling him 'bro' which I never usually do, and I felt it was totally necessary for me to call him that, cos we had this full on connection throughout this time. I know if it had been someone else, they would have had such a hard time dealing with me in that state.
294	I tried lying down on my bed. Getting into the totally relaxed mood, I started feeling and hearing my blood trickle through my body. I knew exactly which route it was taking cos I could feel it, and this was complimented my some subtle trickling noise and another sound (can't remember) for when it was being pumped by my heart. 
295	Although I didn't think it at the time, I'm pretty sure MOST of the reason I had such a good trip was because I was talking to someone who knew EXACTLY what I wanted to hear at the right time and who I could report back to every time I returned from a trip. I took for granted the safety he gave me, but now I realise. Also when my focus moved to my blood flow, I was told to keep off the blood, instead focus on energy flow. Right then I could see the doors leading to dark places revealed and I was lucky to leave before I entered any. Energy flow is a really positive thing to focus on.
296	The most puzzling moment was during the first peak. The lighting was dim as I had turned off my monitor. I relaxed (well, I couldn't really help that heh) and my eyes became very unfocussed, half-closed, in fact, almost closed. Then funny things started happening, the keyboard 'evolved' and so did the faint white lines on my adidas pants, and any other dimly lit stuff just became something really interesting. And I wasn't in 3D anymore, I was in 4D. I felt like my mind was pushed so hard, it was just on the verge of seeing clear 4D, but since my brain isn't used to it, it could make much sense of it. Still, it was very different to 3D - VERY interesting.
297	this wasn't the most freaky part tho. After a while of a ride through 4D, well actually it happened near the start too - displacement. Where I was in relation to everything around me changed. Quite suddenly at first. When I was coming back from the trip, my vision slowly gradually focused. And when it was back in full focus, I freaked! well not really, it was more a puzzled 'Whaaaat the fuuuuck!' (I was laughing while saying it, so there wasn't fear).
298	Now this is very hard to explain properly, but the best I can do is say I felt like I was in a mirror image of where I was before tripping. It was SOOO puzzling, I just couldn't believe my eyes, I thought I had come back to the wrong place, and I'd have to trip again, then try to return to my normal state. The keyboard was on the left of me now. HOW!!!!!! I definitely didn't move and yet it is true. I was seeing clearly, but my whole ROOM was rearranged as a mirror image. Even slightly different to mirror image. Now that was freaky. And it isn't the best description, but it'll have to do. All it took for me to regain a more normal (well STONED normal) vision and perception was rotate my head from side to side looking both directions.
299	Probably the most amusing dream/vision I had during this trip was this: I was flying through a jungle - one with trees that had the most vibrant colors in their leaves. All my favourite colors everywhere!! Then there was this HUGE orange cheesel and I flew right through it! It was siiiiick flying through that hole. Cos dey my fav snack. I think I told the dude I was tripping with that I flew through a cheetos, but dey phukin spherical hehe! 
300	Music - Sound VERY FUCKING DIFFERENT. Hard Bass kicks were very sounding soft, mellow and comforting to my ears. I wanted to hear some sub-bass though cos I felt that would give me so much satifaction - but all I had was headphones. Music becomes VERY 3D! It is much more free and real. BTW this is the first time I've listened to full on dance music with thumpin bass while stoned. Usually I'm listening to more chill music - dnb or mellow shit.
301	vaio - Rapture (Deep Dish Remix) - This is a good one cos I played this not long before I got stoned. Played this over a couple of times, the kicks were very nice, I understood the singing a great deal more - the 'la la la la' parts I could even understand what she was saying there. (I have shit memory of the rest of the details soz)
302	HOUSE MUSIC PLEASE!!!! It's trippy because of the combination of the artists playing with these things: eq filter, resonance, panning. These three simple things together is the recipe for a headfuck on ganja!! An example of house music I played is roger sanchez - another chance. Quite an enjoyable house track, but totally trippy when ur fucked. I'll never forget the first 2 seconds of the track, the artist uses the recipe above to the max - kinda subtle since it's only the first 2 secs, but it literally moved me in the chair and my brain was being skewed by it. Made me real dizzy, it was so satisfying to understand and feel music so well.
303	Analog Pussy - Shperma Pornomatic, this song ALWAYS SOUNDS good, stoned or not, but when stoned it sounded alot 'warmer' and the 'waaaho!' vocals were really bloody enjoyable. amazing stuff.
304	The only thing I'm dissapointed about is I didn't get to try all the things I wanted, cos I wasn't thinking clearly. For so long I didn't even listen to music - but even then it was VERY fun and interesting. If I could add to the experience, I would have listened to the 'headfuck' directory of my collected Infected mushroom tracks. I know they would have fucked me up. I could try it next time, but I dunno if things will be as intense or the same.

307	I was tested at my worksite and failed miserably. Though I never go to work under the influence of any drugs. As a regular user using everyday I initially tested with a THC level of 90 ng/ml. Almost double the allowed concentration. After eight days clean I was re-tested at a level of 48.5 ng/ml. On the quick test I was deemed negative. I hope that these test results will help.

310	Two very close friends and I were staying in a large rented caravan/mobile home for four nights at a small campsite in the New Forest area of England.  The village we stayed in is a tiny, picturesque location complete with a nice country pub and village green, which is occupied by a few wild horses during the day.  Despite coming here twice before, we still thought of ourselves as strangers in this small, isolated, rural community.  It kind of reminded me of old Western films where three horsemen would arrive in a small outback town, causing suspicion and edginess amongst the locals.  Except our horses were bikes  we were there to go mountain biking in the surrounding forest area, you see. 
311	Now Ive set the scene, lets get down to the fun part  the night in question.  We started the evening getting slightly drunk in the caravan and smoking a few joints.  We then headed down to the village pub where we proceeded to drink some more (Jack Daniels as I remember), and make acquaintance with the local laydeez of the village.  Once closing time came we all headed to a house party just down the road from the pub and somehow managed to blag our way in.  There was talk going round of a geezer hanging around outside selling ecstasy, and my friend and I wasted no time in obtaining some of these pills.  Once we had these pills in our hands we began to get quite apprehensive.  It was to be the first time for both of us but there was no going back now so we downed them and had some cheap wine.  Roughly half an hour later, the effects were getting quite noticeable for me and I had the sudden urge to start dancing like a maniac in the middle of the living room floor of this guys house who I didnt even know.  My friend at this point was in the bathroom doing I dont know what so I went into the garden for some fresh air and a brief sit down.  
312	There were some dogs in the garden running around in an enclosed fenced area, and I was getting bored waiting for my friend still in the bathroom, so I decided to feed the dogs.  This involved me carrying armloads of canned dog food from the fridge inside out into the garden to hurl into the dog area.  And this is where it all started to get a bit surreal.
313	I remember making my way out into the front garden of the house and seeing a police car pull up outside.  This brought on a sudden, intense wave of paranoia in me and being the first person he saw, the police officer strolled up to me and started asking questions about noise levels, shouting, things like that.  I blabbered my way through this interrogation with some ease and the officer went inside.  At this point the paranoia really started to creep in.  I had a feeling that everyone was looking for me, for punishing me for every bad thing I had ever done in my life.  Although this might sound like a bad trip to you, I was actually enjoying it as I felt like a James Bond character  everybody looking to kill him, but always staying one step ahead.  The adrenalin rush was like no other I had ever experienced.
314	I was feeling overwhelmed by all the action and so I went back to our caravan alone to get some more weed to mellow me out a bit.  I did this ok but upon returning to the party I decided not to go back in but to head opposite to the village green instead, and watch the action from a safe viewpoint all by myself.  I sat under a tree in total darkness and began to roll and smoke a few joints.  After two joints I remember babbling incoherently like a fool and I must have collapsed or something.
315	I awoke and looked at my watch  it was 5am.  I headed back to the caravan where my friends were fucking around with the TV set or something and I sat down calmly.  I then burst into a full rendition of most of my favourite songs and went to bed.  The singing was especially satisfying as I was feeling like a rock star or something, and that was good.  I like singing when Im wasted anyway.
316	So thats that.  The next day I didnt feel too bad, didnt have a hangover, felt quite good actually, but a bit sick.  Im surprised I can remember so many details of this night but it was all good, like a chapter out of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

319	I had just gotten out of work on a Saturday night and I pulled my usual routine of calling around to see whats happening in my small suburban town. A friend told me to meet him at a park where a few of our mutual friends had gathered to drink and smoke, a girl, lets call her cindy, was sniffing vodka through her nose, several other girls were drinking beers, and I and a few other male friends were playing 20 questions.
320	The Only marijuana available at the park was bricked out dirt weed which i had acquired a quarter pound of the week before. I refused to smoke this as I wasn't sure what percentage of it was actually marijuana. Thus began the search for high potency buds. Within 15 minutes a connect had been established and buds were on the way, we purchased 3 dub sacks and a eighth for a total of 110$. I recieved my 20 bag and we departed for the park.
321	Once we got to the park the gravity bong was filled and it was time to get started, now, this was the first time I got a good look at this weed, and it was beautiful. the bong was packed up and as I lit up and started raising the hitter, the milky white smoke filled the chamber quickly and smoothly. I removed the top and went down on the bottle thrusting 2 liters of thick smoke deep into my lungs. I quickly was knocked out, coughing and heaving but still down for another hit. I repeated this 5 times until the bowl was kicked. and started my journey towards the basketball courts.
322	I paid attention to nothing anyone said. My life had turned into a documentary, like 'This is Your Life' and I had no control over what I was doing. I could hear my voice narrating the events as they happened and i had completely lost touch of reality. Due to the fact that there was a young lady at the park I had the previous intention of hooking up with, it was of upmost importance to keep in touch with reality and not look like a moron. I was shit out of luck, as i stumbled into the car and the music turned on my life became the music. My heartbeat was moving to the beat of the music and my mind was enthralled in the deep bass of the song 'SIOSOS' by the Spooks.
323	I tried telling myself i was coming down but the fact was I was in another world. I convinced myself the marijuana was laced with Acid or PCP, and i started to get visuals. This was the first and only time I have ever experienced visuals with marijuana use, and they were powerful. The stoplights were bouncing to the music and whenever something miraculous like this happened I would experience a 'Mindgasm' the only way I can begin to describe it would be if you were traveling at 2000 mph, flipping through space. Your world collapses and everything around you becomes unreal. It is a relieving feeling but if it occurs too many times, it could induce vomiting. We arrived at Wendys and i purchased a 5 piece chicken and a Biggie Fry. This was a very smart move. The food started to give me a grip on what was going on. Which was good. The documentary voice was telling me that I should play the roll of the 'shy guy' in order to play off the mind games that were destroying my sanity. So I watched out the window, experiencing several more mindgasms before we reached my car.
324	I drove my car home subconciously as I wasn't aware of anything but the road directly in front of me. Successfully dropped off the girls and headed home. I started to come down T+4:00 after the experience and was finally able to attain a deep sleep. The experience, although a bit nauseating at times, was amazing and enlightening. I will savor the remaining buds and hope to share this experience and pass on my story to others. I strongly suggest marijauna for everyone that hasnt done it yet, as it is a wonderful substance and has changed my life for the better.

327	So I've been quite a smoker for a time now but this would be the first time I smoked a real bong. It all started with that I went over to my friends house to smoke some ZeroZero (good hashish). We always just roll one joint not two, we roll the other one when we feel like we need some more. Anyway my friend is da bomb at rollin' joints, he really is, we call him the Professor.
328	So he made one and we smoked it, this is big papers, not regular so it's like maybe 1 gram in one joint. And we got stoned, after a while we thought let's make another one so we did and smoked that too, now we were really stoned. And then a couple of friends arrived with more hashish, and they made a water pipe, so we smoked maybe 3 hits of that pipe. Now we all were really stoned, more stoned than before. So we just chilled while talking and stuff, and then a friends mobile phone rang and he answered it. After he had hung up he told us that our 'drug dealer' was coming to visit us with even more hashish, he said that he would bring a bong.
329	And then my friend said that he didn't think that I could make it, smoking a bong that is, so I said oh yeah? let's make a bet, 2 dollars on that I can, he agreed. Then the dealer came and pulled the bong from a bag and laid it on the table, while he was mixing some hashish. He first took the hit, then it was my turn. He said just inhale like hell, and I did, and I thought this isn't that bad...then I heard his voice telling me to let go of the hole.
330	So I let it go, and there was so much smoke that it came up again without exhaling it. So I started to cough, and all my friends started to laugh their lungs out and I ran to the bathroom and just coughed in the toilet. Then it was over I went to lay down on my friends bed, I felt like something told me to go to the bathroom again, so I did. And just when I got in I puked my hamburger that I had eaten earlier right up, so it wasn't that bad because it still tasted like hamburger. But after a while I was soo totaly lost I was laying on the side on the toilet just trying to get things straight again, I was really tired. And then all suddenly I saw a big shining bathtub, I thought that it would be great to lay down there, but then I realised how 'junkie' it would be so I stayed where I were, near the toilet :)
331	After a while I looked up again and I was lying on the floor, but there were no bathtub there. I didn't realise that I was halucinating so I just walked to my friends again.
332	After a while me and my friend left, I don't have a single idea how I got home but I did...
333	It might not have been all that fun but it was an experience and I got a small idea how to smoke a bong next time.

336	I had never been so stoned in all my life. Of course, I had never really been stoned. I had been high more than a handful of times, mostly just contact highs but also a couple of times smoking up. Nothing, not even the experiences of my friends, could have prepared me for what happened though. It was crazy.
337	The week before this happened, I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed. I had been on painkillers for a couple of days, but stopped taking them a few days before the 'main event'. My parents were going away for the weekend, so I figured I'd have a house party, just me and some friends, and it ended up lasting a few days. Apparently I have a great backyard for smoking - nobody can see into my back yard unless they are standing in it, which is a plus.
338	Friday night before my parents left, two of my friends came over and smoked a little, and we ended up laughing on the basement floor for a good half hour, why I don't know. But the next day was even better. Saturday night, what a night it was. Me and three guys smoking in my backyard. Something none of us thought we would be doing - nobody thought they'd ever be stoned at my house, hell, nobody thought they'd ever see me stoned! Good girl gone bad, I guess.
339	We smoked so much I think I blacked out on my patio at one point. I remember someone waking me up and we went inside, to watch TV or something. That first time I really felt what it was like being stoned, I didn't say too much. I don't remember much of that particular night. I do remember solving the Rubik's cube. I can solve it sober in about 3 minutes, but I tried it stoned - it was the only thing I could focus on for whatever amount of time it took me to solve it. But it kept me in touch with reality, when everything else was wavy and jumpy and slow all at the same time. The volume of sounds kept changing and the only way I could keep it normal was if people kept talking at a constant rate. Strange.
340	I was having premonitions, jumping time, I don't really know how to describe it other than I saw something happen (pillow hitting a can of soda and spilling it onto the floor) before it happened. This wasn't the first vision, I had seen flashes of a man in a white tee-shirt in the woods on Friday night (before this party), that scared the bejesus outta me. Next thing I know, it's morning, and I'm still out of it. But feeling the need, the need for weed. Yes. So one of my friends (who had brought his stash for us to use) packed a bowl and we went back outside to smoke some more. That hit me fast, but not as badly as the night before, and it was a lot more fun. I definitely said a lot more this time. Even later that day I invited some more friends over and we smoked up some more.
341	It thundered that day. I kept yelling that the thunder was trying to get into my house to steal my pop tarts. I had a discussion with my friend about the difference between real soda and 'mind soda'. The whole time I had this incredibly distorted sense of touch. I was asking people if I was moving my hand because I couldn't feel it moving (though apparently it was moving). I knocked soda cans over and walked into a table and didn't even feel it. This feeling didn't wear off for days.
342	Wednesday, parents are back, I'm paranoid that the house smells like weed but nobody notices it except for me so I'm playing it cool. I cleaned up the mess from the party (over 30 soda cans, and the remnants of three days of the munchies) before they returned. But the feeling is still lingering with me. I feel fizzly. You know those fireworks that make the fizzling, sssssssssss, frying pan noise? That's what I feel like. If someone touches my arm with one finger, I feel it all through my arm, sort of like pins and needles only not as painful and a lot longer lasting. I scratch my face and then put my arm back down and I'm not sure if I ever really scratched my face. It's cool but at the same time freaky.
343	If I've learned anything from this, it's got to be don't smoke too much at one time. It's not as fun if you black out. And keep more food in the house. Munchies are bad if you have no food to eat (I think I bit someone because I was hungry). Some people say life is just a bowl of cherries - we say life is just a cherried bowl. Can't wait for my parents to go out of town again.

346	The story begins when my brother got back from college for his winter break and had brought back a film canister full of nugs.  His drug of choice had always been alcohol, so he wasn't that reluctant to hand the canister on to me for a small fee.  I gave him a 20, grabbed the canister, and left to pick up a few friends.
347	Once I had picked three kids up, it was about 8 pm and we decided to stop at a parking lot to light up.  My friend, Allen, brought his sweet glass pipe with him and I started to pack a bowl.  It was cold out, being december, so we stood in a circle to help stay warm and keep the wind from blowing out the flame.
348	I was the first one to smoke.  I lit up and inhaled deeply, being the experienced smoker that I am.  This had to of been the hugest hit of my entire life, because it forced me to double over onto the ground and cough the saliva up from the back of my throat.  I managed to pull myself up back onto my feet with the help of two of my friends.  The first thing that I did once on my feet was try to lick my friend Dan's face, since he was so close to me after helping me up.
349	After smoking, my friends thought it would be cool to see Lord of the Rings on it's opening day.  I hopped into the driver's seat and immediately realised that I wouldn't be able to drive us anywhere in my condition.  We all piled out and started playing tag in the parking lot.  I made sure that I didn't run too fast so that I wouldn't trip; it wouldn't have hurt at all then, but i would've felt it in the morning.
350	After tiring ourselves out a litte, we hopped back into the car and headed down towards the movie theatre.  At the time, I was an inexperienced driver and forgot to turn my lights on, even though it was pitch black outside.  On the way there, I think I see the turn off for the movie theatre, so I pull into the left lane.  After a few seconds of bumpy driving, my friend enlightens me to the fact that I'm off the road, which I correct as if it were an everyday occurance.  It wasn't until later that I realised how close to death we'd come.
351	Now I've read all of the Lord of the Rings books and was heavily psyched to see this movie.  After a few confusing happenings buying tickets and seeing friends from school, we get into the movie.  Even if I had been in my right mind, this movie would have been sweet, but after smoking what I had, it was nothing short of a religious experience.  I highly recommend seeing it even without smoking first.

354	This afternoon I had a really strange experience on weed and was wondering if anyone else has had the same thing happen. I have been smoking for about 3 years and I am now 17. Recently (the last 4 months) there hasn't been more than 10 days when I haven't smoked up. I had just gotten off school this lovely Friday afternoon and was looking foward to a nice big session. Me and my mate loaded a couple of cones and started toking. Now this shit I had smiked before. It was quality. It had so many crystals on it and it smelled really potent. Anyway, after the cones were finished my friend went to drop his car home and we were supposed to meet at his place in about 15 minutes to pick him up and go to work. I was sitting on the side of the road waiting for my brother to bring the car home when shit started happening. I was staring at the road in front of me and it started waving like water. I thought this was odd but cool and continued to stare in awe. What happened next was the most awesome open eyed visual display I have experienced. The outline of a cartoon character appeared and then continued to morph into various other characters and objects. I was probably watching this for about 10 minutes and I really was in a world of my own. I then closed my eyes and was welcomed by an amazing array of colourful orbs etc.
355	Anyway. This experience was not a bad one although it was very unexpected. Just wondering what happened and if anyone else has experienced this from smoking weed.

358	It seems that some people seem to have some problems or strange ideas as to how to smoke cannabis oil.
359	In New Zealand one of the most common ways of smoking pot is referred to as 'spotting', using the element of a kitchen stove in combination with knives.  I believe this is referred to as 'hot-kniving' in other parts of the world.
360	The best type of knives to use have non-metal handles.  Bone-handled knives work well, but be careful to not let the handle touch the element, otherwise you'll have a small fire-show in your kitchen :)
361	Turn the element on to full power (this works best with gas or spiral-metal elements) and place the knive as hard against this as possible.  Sometimes a round piece of metal (such as the top of a coffee tin) is used as a hat on top, however this is usually somewhat excessive for Oil.  It usually takes 5-10 mins for the elements to heat up properly (significantly longer with gas)
362	Take a small blob of oil and place it on the end of a needle.
363	You will also require some kind of tube for sucking up the smoke, I would suggest making a makeshift 'straw' out of the top of packet of cigarette papers or something similar.
364	Place the straw in your mouth, and with the other hand pull out the red-hot knife from under the element.  Move the straw towards the end of the knife and begin inhaling slowly.  With your other hand place the blob of oil onto the knife and rub it up and down a little bit.  The oil should bubble a little bit then 'poof' the smoke out.  Make sure you're inhaling a little faster for when it starts smoking.
365	It can take a few attempts to master the timing. But, with a small amount of practise, you can achieve near-perfect 'spots' with almost no wastage at all.
366	It may be easier to get a friend to do the burning (driving) for you, while you concentrate on sucking up all the smoke.

369	I had smoked weed about 7-8 times before this experience.  All of which I had been smoking 'shwag' (low quality weed) and had heard many times about how Kine/Skunk was much better and definitely worth the extra cash. I had also heard that weed, when ingested, gave a slightly different effect and that it strings out your high for as long as 6 hours.  I had ingested low-quality weed orally before, and didn't notice much difference from smoking it.. just a longer high.
370	I finally bought some very high quality weed for the first time and had only smoked it before.. never ingested.  Needless to say 1/2 of a joint of the weed would put me off my ass when it was smoked from... but tonight was a different story.  
371	I was at my apartment and my roommate was away for the week, so I decided i wanted to try to make some cool music (guitar player) whilst i was stoned.. and since i was alone I knew that i wouldn't be bothered.  I thought.. shwag was boring when i ate it... I wonder if this will be the same.... boy was i wrong.
372	I was sitting at the computer chatting with someone right after i had taken it and thought to myself.. it will be 30 minutes or so before this stuff kicks in... so i'll chat for a bit.  Well, 30 minutes rolled around and i didn't feel a damn thing.  I thought.. well shit, its gotta be coming pretty soon!  5 mintues or so after that my friend said something that made me chukle a little. I stretched out breifly & cracked my back and then out of nowhere a feeling came over me.  I started to laugh again at what my friend had said and after what seemed like 2-3 minutes i relized that i was laughing my fucking ass off!  I was laughing so hard i could barely catch my breath.  That time period made me ponder... I thought to myself... Jesus!..  I had laughed for like 3 minutes straight at a comment that wasn't even that funny.  It clicked as though i had forgotten i had eaten the weed 40 minutes ago... ahh i'm stoned now.  I wondered to myself.. I have never had week that hit me so suddenly like that... out of the blue.  
373	All of the sudden i remembered that this was the very high quality weed that i invested my money into.  'Woah' I thought... those guys must have been talking about kine when they said there is a whole new side to being high when you eat it.  
374	It all ten-folded from there.  I was experiencing feeling that I had never felt before when i was high.  Everything was blown way out of proportion.  I grabbed a handfull of chips and started to much on them and thought... my tounge feels awful funny... Hmm.   I chewing the chips i was eathing and started to move my tounge around inside my mouth.  It was the most odd feeling i had ever encountered. It was as if my tounge were partially numb, but its actions FELT inversed.  I would put my tounge on the roof of my mouth and think to myself - Big Al dude.. thats the TOP of your mouth you moron, but the physical side of me was telling me.. No Al... your on the bottom right now.  
375	I started thinking about actions such as these too much and it started to frighten me.  Subconsiously my tounge wouldn't sit still, like it was trying to confuze me and bring my attention back to what i didn't want to think about.  Kinda scary at the time...  -  I then started concetrating more on chatting with my friend online.  He was aware that i was stoned, but i hadn't explained to him yet that I had ingested kine for the first time.  
376	I started to explain to him the conditions of which i was under, but instead i ended up writing him a novel.  I explained in extremely great detail that i had ingested kine bud instead of smoking it.  He replied to me.. 'Woah dude... i know your a perfectionist, but why in the hell did you just type me 3 fully fledged paragraphs about how you ATE the weed and didn't smoke it' ... I tried to understand what he was relaying back to me.  My mind was thinking hundreds of possibilities of different things that were in the front of my mind at the time.  It was almost like listening to a song and breaking it down one instrument at a time, then splicing them back together but to make something new.  My mind was racing.  I thought to myself.. If i am thinking about all of the different sides/perspectives/shapes and forms of things, then how can i benefit from this experience.  
377	CLICK!  -  Music.  I immediately jumped up from my chair, typed out hastily to my friend that i would be back in a bit and rushed over to the guitar.  I stopped for reasons i couldn't understand, looked around the room, and became extreamly scared in the blink of an eye.  Sudennly i had absolutely no interest in music, but wanted to get back with my friend because i was feeling unsafe mentally.  I started telling my friend that i was getting freaked out.  He asked questions in a calm manner to me such as 'tell me what youre feeling right now'... I lashed out at him for no reason saying things like.. 'Fuck you dude... i'm scared shitless.. i feel like i'm gonna die or something!'.  He was calm through the whole ordeal, but i felt like i was going insane.  I started asking myself questions in my head very VERY quickly with answers to none.  'What if i do die'?, 'What if the police find this chatbox after i die'!? Then i thought to myself... wholy shit... i'm so goddamn paranoid i THINK i'm going to die.  That settled my mind and i was very releaved when i come to the thought that i was just really stoned.  Duh AL... your not gonna die, your safe.
378	After that my typing became very hyper... all of the sudden i felt like i had a lot to say, and i had to say it fast.  I made so many spelling errors due to speed and being stoned that my friend kept telling me - your not making sense.  It was all pointless anyhow, and i stepped back from my mind to think about why i was typing fast in the first place.  I had no idea.
379	By now i was about 2 hours into the high and my hyperness turned into hapiness.  Instead of typing faster, i started anylizing the text coming from my friend and could understand concepts much better.  I felt much better now, and then i noticed that the whole time i had forgot about my tounge that had been flailing around in my mouth without me knowing it.  I felt deathly sore in the mouth and my tounge hurt badly.  I grabbed hold of a mountain dew next to me and took a swig... WARM! Nasty!!! I thought... shit - i had better get a cold one.  I walked out of my room and headed to the fridge when i saw my roomate's cat sitting the floor. I looked in the fridge and found a dew, closed the fridge and saw something out of the corner of my eye.  It scared the shit out of me - I looked over quickly and saw it was the cat i had just seen.  VERY werid feeling like my extreme short term memory was going out on me. 
380	The cold dew was better, but still didn't taste that great. I sat back down at the computer and my friend said 'lets go play some starcraft' ... i was quite hesitant at first and told him that it may make me freak out again.. but he was in the mood so i went along with it.  I had an absolute blast. I was laughing my ass off the whole time.. commanding my men to kill eachother and whatnot.  It was such a great feeling knowing that i could put these charachters through hell and nobody would be hurt.  Needless to say we lost the game.  I had told my friend 'i think my high is coming down now'.   He departed and i logged off and went to sleep thinking of all the COMPLETELY different experiences i felt in comparison to when i had ingested shwag.
381	The whole week after that i had a different look on things...  everyone i saw and all the things i thought of were totally different than before.  This slowly decreased and i became myself after the weeks period was through.  I think it may have been what i would like to call a 'temporary life-changing experience'... i'm not sure.

384	The night started out ok, with nothing to worry about.  My friend showed up at my house with some brownie mix and the weed.  We made the brownies and called a couple people to see what they were doing.  Two of them couldn't do anything and the other one was pretty indecisive.  We went ahead and ate a brownie and start getting some sort of effects.  I must say that it didn't taste too terrific.  The stems and seeds tend to add a bit of crunchiness to them.  I think all we did at first was just laugh; nothing too exciting.  After awhile we ate two more, wanting better effects.  We soon started to get very confused about everything.  One of us would be talking and suddenly stop what we were saying, due to the fact that we just plain forgot what we were talking about.  This happened numerous times throughout the night.  Both our bodies were very numb, but in a pleasant way.  I almost felt like if I tried to get up I wouldn't be able to.  I guess I did, because my friend had to go home, so I let her out the door.  
385	I then proceeded get online and find something to do.  I hadn't been on the computer for more than 10 minutes, when everything went wrong.  I thought that my friend was still in my house, and when I turned around, she wasn't there.  I thought she might be in the other room.  This is where I thought I got up from the computer and searched around the house.  I was either thinking, or saying out loud, 'Where is ****, where did she go?'  The next thing that happened was I was simply sitting at the computer thinking to myself, 'Oh yeah, she went home.'  I thought that she might be hurt somewhere and didn't make it home.  I finally had to call her just to make sure she was ok.  
386	I also started to think I was doing all this stuff and then I would realize that I hadn't moved from where I was.  I felt so lost, and was really scared.  I kept thinking that something had to be wrong; I shouldn't be scared from just a little bit of weed.  I decided to lie down on my bed and attempt to fall asleep, which is what I must have done.  I also think that my heart was beating really hard sometimes throughout that night.    
387	When I woke up I felt like I had done a bunch of hard drugs the night before.  I looked in the mirror and realized that I looked horrible.  I'm still really tired right now as I write this; it's only the day after.  I'm not sure I'd want to eat another weed brownie again if I'm going to be thinking that I'm talking to people and doing stuff that I'm not.  Being scared and thinking that your friend might be hurt and you don't know where she is, can be really frightening.

390	One day me and two of my friends went into a nature center to smoke this new weed that one of the friends just got. This was the best stuff I had ever smoked! After only three hits, I went insane. At first I started laughing uncontrollably, which always happens. Then as we were walking through the paths, my vision started to blink vertically instead of the normal horizontal (when blinking). All the colors everywhere became very amazing and bright, but that was nothing. Now about five minutes have passed with straight laughter, and then I noticed that it sounded as if all sound was coming directly to my ears, and not traveling through the air. this was an amazing sensation to me. 
391	After we all piled into the van, we drove off to find a place to skate.  While we were at a red light, I went into a trip where I thought i was talking out my window to a ticketman in his ticket booth. While talking to him about who knows what, I remember holding onto a pet alligator and petting it. Then right before the light turned green, I woke up to find that my pet alligator had dissapeared! I yelled out to my friends,'where did my pet alligator go?!' as if they knew. Then I explained to them what had just happened while we were at the red light. They just laughed at me and we drove on. 
392	Then they stoped at a Hardees to get something to eat. They decided to keep me in the van because it wouldn't be a good idea to bring me inside, because I was still laughing non-stop. While they were inside, I imagined a rabbid bunny jumping out from behind a bush and attacking an ant. They came back to the van to find me still laughing it up. I told them the story, but they couldn't understand because I was mumbling and laughing way too much.
393	We found a good place to skate, but I was too tired to get out of the van. so my friends had to drag me out and set me on the grass. They skated for a while, while I just sat there watching them and laughing about the crazy noises I was hearing. Then a security guard came along and shoed us away. I was careful enough to keep it straight, but it was extemely hard. After that we just drove home and wait a bit till I came down, so then I could tell them my whole story and they could tell me what they thought about it.

396	I parked my car at the entrance to the Rainbow Falls bush track, and sparked up a joint of good bud. I thought I'd better leave my intake at 4 tokes 'cos I'd had bad experiences with weed lately due to spinal problems and weird skull sensations.
397	I do a lot of walking (while stoned) in the beautiful bush/river tracks around my area. It is a very healthy and enjoyable activity alone or with good company. The Rainbow Falls track runs alongside a beautiful river and is surrounded by native and introduced bush. It is one of three areas I frequent.
398	As I descended into the forest, I felt a deep respect for the ancient moss-covered natural rock walls, and emerged into the clearing where the huge falls can be viewed. The power was immense, and I felt the huge downwards force having an effect on me, but then I noticed the spray lifting up and floating away - forces balanced, and I picked myself up again. Some (Dutch? German?) tourists looked at me and looked scared and nervous - I don't know why (I don't think it was weed paranoia) - I looked normal and was wearing normal clothing - shit, I even smiled at them, but their reactions made me feel bad, unwelcome in my homeland. I tried to ignore it and made my way further down the track.
399	Passing more angry/frightened tourists who volunteered nothing but sneers and timid glances, I was starting to have a bad buzz. My spinal/cranial pains were playing up, and my mood was worsening. I continued down the track and came upon a grove of strange, ancient trees. Suddenly, it was all clear - the destructive force inside me was attacking me (I had been training hard in my Taekwondo all week), and possibly it showed through and scared the tourists on some level, too. I felt I had to give some of it to the trees, so I spread my fingers and let it drain out through my arms. This felt right. I also felt the trees reward me by soothing my mood and my body. It was like a trade of my destructive potential energy for their healing.
400	After this turning point, my buzz picked right up. I passed some American tourists, a couple wearing bright parkas, and greeted them as I did the others, and they gave me warm greetings back - they weren't scared!
401	I then decided I wanted to be close to the water, so I cruised down to the river and picked out a good place to sit on the flat stones in the middle. I sat there for an hour, basking in the gentle sun peeking through the canopy, contemplating the nature of water and the trade I had just made. I felt good to be alive. I thanked nature and made my way back up the track.
402	On my way back, I contemplated what things would be like if social structures were different. What if we still had Kings and Knights and Druids? Surely it would be fitting, I thought, to follow the ways of these majestic forests? It seems that as we've 'advanced,' people's minds have become blunted or desensitised to this underlying magic in nature, and using certain drugs is one way to recapture and experience this beauty - if only for a short time.

405	One day after work my friend and I decided to smoke some new kind bud that he just picked up a few days before. He told me that this stuff was strong, but being an experienced smoker I thought nothing of it.  We got to his house and his wife decided to toke with us. So I had a seat on the couch and he started to roll a nice jay. After rolling it, we proceeded to smoke this bad boy, of course passing it in session between the three of us. By the time the jay was gone I could not believe the quality of the bud, my head was seriously spinning.
406	This was different to me, most of the time I gotta smoke at least three jays to get where I was. He broke out his pipe, which didn't suprise me any, as I figured we were going to smoke more. He packed about 20 roaches in the pipe and me and him smoked them, and then he packed 2 bowls of the kind bud. Needless to say, I was baked, standing up not possible. We started to watch tv and got tired of it quickly. We ended up going and playing pool at a local bar, I could hardly make a shot much less order drinks. I ended up messing up the drink order and we all had soda. So we went over to my friend's house and sat there and played video games.
407	The buzz had begun at 11:00 am and we left the bar at about 12:45, and the rest of the time we played video games. I ended up looking at some of my friend's art that he had on the wall, and someone came over and started to talk to me. I asked them what time it was because I had to be somewhere at 4:00. They said it was 10:30. I said, 'What the hell, it's not 10:30, quit messing with me.' But it actually was 10:30 and I ened up missing some important dates, but oh well, I was too baked to care. We had been smoking while playing the games, about 4 more bowls.
408	Well, I guess I would have to say never underestimate the true power of good bud and always keep an eye on what time it is in case you need to be somewhere. I was almost in a time warp when I was looking at his artwork and the only reason I asked what time it was was because it felt like only 20-30 min.

410	If anyone is looking for some music to listen to when you're stoned, I have the perfect song:  'The End' by the Doors.  Let me tell you, listen to this song, and tell me if the same thing happens to you:
411	I was lying on my friend's bed, getting ready for the song to come on. The lights were out, except for a lava lamp in the corner.  The first few measures of the song sound like they are literally going in one ear, colliding with your brain, and then exiting the other ear.  Then Jim starts singing. It is like you're walking up the stairway to heaven. You can picture yourself walking up a golden staircase, with little angel children playing the instruments all along the sides of the stairs. All along the staircase there are trees of gold and candy.  Jim Morrison is like God, calling you to heaven. I picture myself wearing this white dress with sparkles all over, and a crown of flowers. Finally, you have reached heaven, and you hear birds chirping, almost like you're in a field of flowers. If you concentrate hard enough, it almost feels like you're flying.
412	Suddenly, the song changes. It's like all your sins have culminated, and 'God' realizes it, and starts you on your way to hell. The music gets creepy, and the birds die out slowly.  It felt like I was falling. I literally felt something pulling me downward.  Jim starts singing, only it's more like yelling. He is now more of a satan character.  The images in your head go from being white and gold, to red and black. The force that pulls you is so intense, it is the most amazing experience.
413	So, now that you all think I'm crazy, try listening to this song when you're stoned, and get back to me on the results :).

416	Originally searching for hashish, I was instead offered opium.  Knowing that opium is black or brown I contested the authenticity of this dark red solid covered in red powder.  Regardless I would try it.  The first time was with low grade marijuana in a glass pipe.  The effects were strictly cannabis.  I doubted the red rock at that point and was planning vengence.  Conversely, the next experience - same cannabis, same pipe - was eventfull to say the least.  The rock was not crushed and simply placed upon the cannabis.  Immediately after smoking I entered my car to return home.  It was night time.  Soon - approximately 2 minutes - my perception darkened and I realized quickly that I was in no shape to drive, but proceeded anyway.  Driving on a road I cover every day I couldn't recognize where I was.  I would see (hallucinate) a person running across the street.  This seemed real to the point that I reacted accordingly and hit the brakes.  Then I was convinced that I was driving in the opposite direction.  The road was well lit, yet I was having great difficutly  seeing the objects surrounding me and the road.  I feared I would crash.  
417	I returned home - I can't remember the details of how - and layed down.  I was suffering from visual impairment.  I began listening on my discman to URB vol. 1.  Strangely the only track I could listen to was Goldie's Innercity.  I attempted to listen to some of the others but was forced to return to Goldie.  The music sounded different; I could hear sounds I hadn't recoginized before.  The singer's voice had me hypnotized.  This was a euphoric feeling.  I had lost my anxiety over the strange new feeling and was now at ease enjoying the sound.  Remembering a friend's story of how opium helped him have intense sex for hours, I decided to masturbate.  When I finally ejaculated the feeling was too intense.  My body reacted as having experienced an attempted resuscitation with shock pads.  I felt my consciousness hover above where I was laying. Then I was enveloped by a black hole.  Everything darken and I felt asleep, yet fully conscious.  Throughout this experience I believed I might have been dying.  I did not fight, just passively accepted.  Suddenly I awoke and had reason to believe that only 10 minutes had passed.  
418	Indeed this was a frightning experience.  I am now aware of red rock not being an opiate, but have not an explanation for my experience.

421	This experience has many question marks. I still do believe that there was some reaction of some kind that caused it. However, the experience itself was really something else. I have never used LSD or any other psychedelics except for a pill of MDMA (Mitsubishi) two weeks before this experience. 
422	That night I went to my friend's house (who, by the way, is a doctor in psychology, with several writings on cannabis) and we decided to rent a couple of movies and smoke our way through the night. We cooked and ate as well as had a bottle of a horrible white wine. The joints were coming and going and by the end of the first movie I was really stoned. Everything was 'normal.' At that point my friend decided that we had to do this bong sort of thing he calls the drainer. So we did with a good amount of pure skunk each. I went well off at that point. Really really stoned, I crawled on the couch and we were getting ready for the second movie. 
423	Then I started shivering as if it was extremely cold. I had felt this side-effect before, so did not care much and it left quickly. At this point, instead of the movie, we started chatting, talking about how stoned we were. Suddenly I felt so strange. I could not really explain, but it was as if the effects of cannabis were strengthened tenfold. My friend asked if I was well. That was it, I just took off. I had no perception of space (including gravity) or time. I started calling out for help as I was drawn into a vortex of some kind, as everything was spinning around me with incredible force. I panicked and I felt like I was going to pass out. My heartbeat was strong and fast and I was breathing very hard. I could hardly feel my limbs, as they were all going numb and I got really scared at this point. My understanding of reality was also very different than usual; I cannot really define it. However, something was very wrong. I tried to focus. There was no way I could. I laid on the couch, which looked huge, and I was feeling like an insect on it. That was another effect - my size in space was no longer a constant, it was relative to my feelings. My friend offered to make me a coffee as I laid on the bed, I could hear his every move and every little sound. The sugar falling in the cup and the sound of the teaspoon was so annoying. I started feeling better. For just a few seconds. But there it came again, taking me into this vortex of paranoia and insanity. 
424	Weird thoughts start crossing my mind. I became a little bit aggressive, started shouting. I quickly called a taxi and left the place. The taxi ride was about 3 minutes. It felt like aeons passed. The taxi driver was talking to me and his voice was coming with echo. I looked at him and he was miles away from me. By then I was in my room. Had a shower, called my girlfriend and went to bed. The feeling was there, but I was coming down. I woke up the next day only to find that I was steel feeling it. It was completely gone by the afternoon. I had another joint then, just to check. It didn't came back, everything was 'normal' again. My 'normal' is a bit different than it used to be before that. I thought I was too close to insanity. I had no visuals of any kind except from faulty space perception and distorted objects. No closed eye visuals.

427	I am going to describe to you the effects of the first time I ever became extremely high.  Hopefully, this will help you decide whether or not to try marijuana.  I, as you will find out, suggest you do.
428	It wasnt the first time I had smoked marijuana.  I have, other times, smoked from both pipes and doobies.  However, the effect hadnt been worth the time spent smoking it.  I think, however, that this was because I did not know how to partake of the herb.  In other words, I was inhaling wrong.  One must breathe it in, not suck.  Inhale from your lungs, not your mouth.  Suck it down until it starts to itch.  You may want to cough.  Dont.  Stop the hoot, and pass the pipe off, without exhaling.  Suck in some air quickly, so that your throat doesnt itch as much.  Hold the smoke in your lungs, not your cheeks, for about ten seconds, maybe longer, and then exhale slowly.  Breathe a bit.  
429	I cant tell you how much to smoke.  I am lean, 511, 165lbs, I repeat, thin.  Doesnt sound thin, but I am bone and muscle.  No fat.  I think because of this, I need more to be very high, because there is less tissue for the THC to hang out in.
430	This time, I had about a thimble full of marijuana, chopped up.  Its hard to describe how much I had, as the common measurements (an eighth, a half-bag) change depending on where you are on the planet.  I had enough to make a small pile in your palm, about one inch high, one inch wide.  I got two bowls out of it, but that was a small pipe.  I was very calm, looking forward to the high.  This time, I decided, I would find out what it was really like.  It is important to be calm.  Dont do it if you are afraid of being caught.  I suggest doing it in a remote area, such as a campground, or your own home.
431	Anyways, it was the middle of winter, freezing cold (this is Canada).  My friend and I decided to smoke and go tobogganing.  We arrived at the hill, and were there alone.  We went to the bottom of the hill and I smoked all I had.  I should mention that the hill was large, and was actually a hiking path leading down the hill through a forest.  Above us was the steep path, and around that was forest.  At the bottom of the hill there was a lake (frozen) and there was at least one or two feet of snow on the ground.  As I finished off the last of the weed, I suddenly felt like something was trying to push me over.  Not hard, just like a wall of air pushing me softly.  This happened on and off, about three times, for about two minutes (I think).  I finished the weed and stood with my friend, talking about who would go for the next ride.  He had not smoked anything.  Suddenly, I found myself beginning to talk a lot, about nothing.  I was also talking quite loudly, almost shouting.  I remember that I was suddenly not cold, but in fact quite warm.  
432	At this point, mostly everything goes blank.  I remember a number of things, though, that happened throughout the next thirty or so minutes.  I talked a lot.  I laid down in the snow and slammed my head against the ice of a lake (we had been on the bank, and I walked a few feet onto the ice).  There was a lot of snow on it, but I managed to bang through it.  I think I was trying to make snow angels, but Im not sure.  Whatever the case, I didnt feel any pain.  In fact, it was quite fun.  Meanwhile, my friend was riding the toboggan down the hill.  I was shouting at him the whole time, saying really nothing.  I think I had my eyes closed, because I was very warm and I felt like I was sleeping.  At one point, he walked towards me and I jumped up.  His jacket had been rustling and I thought he was my puppy, who tends to rustle as he runs towards you to lick you.  Whatever the case, I explained this to my friend in a very loud voice, so that he would understand.  
433	One important thing to note here is that unless I concentrated, I could not simply say something to my friend.  As soon as I stopped concentrating, everything went blank again, and I fell around some more.
434	Another thing is the fact that I laughed.  I have never laughed so hard in my life.  My friend, laughing at me, laughed a lot too.  I fell all over the place, laughing in a million different ways, very different than my normal way.  A few times, I laughed for long periods of time, harder and harder.  I think the longest period was almost four minutes.  I could hardly breathe by that time.  The laughter is something you must savor.  It is amazing.  You have no reason to laugh, yet you do, hysterically, like a jackal.  I must emphasize that it is very different than normal laughter.  It is phenomenal.  You should have someone video tape you, because you will want to see it again.  You will laugh for the stupidest reasons, probably falling down a lot.  Therefore, I suggest you stand up, because you want to stay excited.  By falling down, you give yourself more to laugh at.
435	At that point, I laid back down (or should I say, fell over).  I then began to talk in every accent I can do, British, Yankee, whatever I could think of.  I remember thinking I had been speaking every language on earth, and I decided to talk to my friend in Chinese.  To me at the time, Chinese was a simple aye-aye-aye-aye.  I did this for a long time, slamming my head into the ice at the same time.
436	Then my friend offered to let me go down the hill.  This, of course, involved me walking up the hill, so I began the long march.  I remember feeling like my voice was a springboard.  This is very hard to describe.  My voice felt very high-pitched, so I was trying to force it down to its normal pitch.  I now know that I thought I was moving through at least fourteen octaves (if you sing you understand that only the best singers can do even eight).  My voice was very high, and as I forced it down, I thought it was becoming more like my normal voice (which is quite low).  But as soon as I stopped trying to hold it down, it shot back up.  I think I was in fact making myself quieter, not lower.
437	Whatever the case, the feeling was euphoric at this point, not really calm.  It took me at least three minutes to get up the hill, which normally would have taken only one or so.  I slipped a lot, since I was wearing Vans on a slope that most people would hesitate to even walk down, let alone ride a toboggan down.  When I got to the top, I then went down, very slowly.  I dragged my feet the whole way, without wanting to, and everything was very blank.  I could hardly see, and felt very mellow by this point.  I think I was beginning to force myself out of my state of mind.  When I got to the bottom, we decided to go.  I do not remember walking back up the hill, but I remember climbing a fence, and walking across a field, and thinking I was going to die of hypothermia, and thinking my friend was going to pass out. 
438	When we got to his house, I was still quite blank, and feeling quite calm and empty.  I ate two massive plates of stir-fry.  Then we watched TV for a while, and then I went home, no longer high.
439	The high is not an ecstasy high.  It does not help you discover yourself, nor does it help you solve problems.  Weed is not something to be used for depression, as after you are done, the effects are gone, completely, other than the memories.  You will not feel like a god, or a better person.  You will simply have laughed a lot.
440	I do not suggest driving, swimming, cycling, or doing anything that could be dangerous, while you are high.  I find I lose a lot of control over my muscles, and can hardly move.  The main effect is the laughter, and the blank feeling.  You feel like you are not in your body, you feel like you are sleeping, dreaming.  It is an amazing feeling.  The whole high, for me, lasted for about one to one and a half hours.  I cant remember exactly.  I think that if I had smoked much more, I would have been completely incapacitated.  As it was, I could hardly move.  I think it is impossible to overdose on marijuana, but you can certainly make yourself throw up a lot, I know.  I dont suggest smoking to the point that you cant think at all.  I have seen people who, when high, cant walk, and crawl instead.  A friend of mine crawled about three miles.  It took him a number of hours.  He doesnt remember any of it.
441	All in all, I suggest bringing a friend with you, who will not be high when you are.  Smoke enough to get you to the point that you feel comfortable.  Dont do enough to go fucking potty.  I recommend marijuana to all of you, before anything else.  Before you can walk, you must crawl.  Before you try E, acid, K, or anything else, try weed.  Its fun, quite safe, and cheap.  I rate it A+.

444	Once upon a merry little time, I was feeling rather sick.  I decided the best medicine would be some high quality grass.  So I called my friends over.  We rolled two decent sized joints and smoked them between the two of us.  Being a very inexperienced smoker at the time, I was very fucked up.  When someone tried to talk to me, their voice would echo in my head.  I kept having flashbacks of my childhood, hearing old phrases and seeing old faces.  After about ten minutes, my friends went home.  It was about 10:00 and the shit was just kicking in hard.  I decided to go to bed.  I put on a Floyd concert, turned out the lights and got into bed.  I closed my eyes and immediatelly I was transported to an alien world.  The lights from the t.v. created some of the most amazing closed eye visuals I had ever seen.  Then suddenly my bed lifted off the ground.  I had the desire to open my eyes because it was way too real.  But I kept them shut.  As my bed went soaring through the clouds, I realized that I was not at all sick anymore.  So I continued to enjoy spinning through a spiral vortex of color and thought.
445	Ever since that night, I've tried to get that high.  I've come close, but can never get that fucked up off two fucking joint now matter how strong they are.

447	The day before spring break, a friend and I decided to have a little smoke session over at my apartment. We hadn't smoked in over 24 hours, and no other drugs had been taken. Being a novice smoker at the time, my friend offered to introduce me to the gravity bong. There are several different ways to make a gravity bong, but we chose to use a 2-liter soda bottle with the bottom 1/4 cut off. 
448	Preparation included filling the kitchen sink with water, and cutting/burning a hole in the bottle cap so as to insert the bowl on top of it. These activites took longer than anticipated, so we smoked a bowl using a regular pipe as we waited. When everything was ready, we inserted the packed bowl into the bottle cap hole, heated it with a lighter to seal it, and set up the bottle in the sink, w/the cap on top. 
449	After a few hits, I had the rythm and technique down for obtaining extremely large hits. This continued for quite a while, and the bowl seemed to last forever. My friend was able to fill the chamber so full that both of us could get an enormous hit off one pull.
450	By the end of the second bowl, I felt somewhat tired. The kitchen seemed so strange as a surrounding, and the light intensity seemed different from normal. My arms and legs were too heavy to move, and I put my head down. The conversation with my friend stopped, and I sat with my head down for a long time. During that time, I was able to see scenes of mixed colors and shapes, that appeared almost as if I had made them appear. 
451	After a while I got up and my friend left. I went to my bedroom, and stared at a car poster with glowing headlights--this intrigued me for at least 5 minutes, and I was able to see things in the glowing headlights. Then I closed my eyes and saw shapes and colors again, except I could control them and make them do what I wanted.
452	This experience, different from my normal high, seemed to last hours, but when I 'woke up,' I called my friend and told him, and he said it had only been a few minutes since he had left. I haven't felt anything like that since then, but the effect sparked my interest in 'tripping substances.'

455	Upon arrival in Canada from Scotland, I was soon invited to try some lovely B.C weed going by the name of White Widow. The stuff was covered in sticky, white THC chrystals and was like nothing I had ever seen before. Having only smoked low-stength resin back home, I was well up for it as were my buddies. The smell was very pungent but very nice. 
456	As soon as we lit up, we could feel the good times roll. After a few strong puffs, we were all absolutely f**ked. My English friend thought he was an explorer and started to swim accross the front lawn. Needless to say, the hilarity sent us into huge fits of uncontrollable laughter. Then, when it eventually subsided a little, I honestly started to believe I was a monkey. I sped around the room like monkeys do making the kind of noises monkeys do. We thought it was hilarious although one of my friends wasn't quite so impressed when I ate all the bananas out his cupboard but hey, I had the serious munchies.
457	After we all calmed down, we got down to some serious munching accompanied by some quality music. The visuals and sonics were amazing. Trip Hop was invented for this drug.
458	I don't know if we were smoking extra strong stuff or it was just because we were new to strong weed but this has to be the single best drug experience if my life.

460	Cannabis (1) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
461	My friend and I had made our way over to a record shop to see a few local bands and stumbled upon a friend whom offered to sell us some weed. Being quite glad we ran into him we purchased a 15 sac and made our way over to the concert. 
462	After arriving there and staying for about an hour we decided to go smoke up with a few friends whom we conveniently ran into. We arrived at his garage and had a beer. Than he pulled out a bowl and a half ounce and started passing it around.  We left after what seemed like 30 minutes. 
463	We arrived at my friends house and smoked some of our 15 sac. Then found ourselves in his brothers bedroom listening to Ministry. I was wearing my SFX contact lenses which made my eyes red and yellow. I started mouthing the words to the song and air guitaring to it. My friend started cracking up and saying my eyes looked like they were on fire. He said he thought I was Satan and started geeking out a little bit, so  I decided to stop. Than started poking at his eyes but not really touching them. He grabbed his eyes and started moaning like I had really poked him. He said it felt like his pupils were going into the back of his head and down into his throat. I started cracking up but at the same time a sense of fear had come over me. So I tried to take control and decided that we go downstairs and eat something. We walked into the kitchen and he puked into the sink and repeated trying to puke when there was nothing left.
464	I was trying to control my laughter considering the fact that I was scared out of my mind. Yet I still managed to try to calm him down and myself as well. By now I realized we had to be tripping some sort of way. We had gone back to his brothers room and started watching TV. He had gone to bed because his head was spinning and he couldn't take it. I was overcome with fear of my friend getting this weird idea in his head and coming into the room and murdering me, so I locked the door. Than I heard a voice in the back of my head telling me to go do what I just thought. I was staring at a sharpened pencil laying on the ground than geeked out and threw the covers over my head. I squeezed my eyes shut in hopes to fall asleep.
465	I woke up a few minutes later to find myself in the same state. I went downstairs to get something to eat. Somehow I managed to cook eggs and wrap them up in a burrito with cheese. I sat down to eat it and kept on seeing someone in the doorway out of the corner of my eye. I just ignored it. After taking a few bites the burrito started to taste real bad. I looked at it and the eggs were all liquidy and looked like some sort of mush. I spit it out on the plate and threw it away. Than ran up stairs into the same room, locked the door, and forced myself asleep.

1	LSD (2) : Festival / Lg. Crowd (24), General (1), Music Discussion (22), Mystical Experiences (9), Glowing Experiences (4)
2	This experience happened quite a while back. It was by no means my first or last experience with acid, but hopefully it conveys some of the reasons why it is my favorite drug.  Enjoy.
3	My boy E had just returned from a trip with an entire fifth gallon of liquid.  It was yet undiluted, and he graciously gave me 10 drops of it, equally distributed onto 5 space treats.  Although it was already past midnight, we glanced mischieviously at each other and knew it was time to ride.  We quickly got my girlfriend H to agree to the mission, and for the fourth traveler, we phoned my friend B.  We told him to go back to sleep and await further instructions from us in person.  E, H, and I hopped in my ride and took a 15min ride out to the country.
4	At 2am, we awoke B, who lives next door to one other house.  It was a cold, winter night and we shuffled indoors to stay warm.  Once indoors, B greeted us with some organic tea.  We lit candles and made ourselves comfortable with some Dj Cam.  We each took just 2 hits (later to become an inside joke), and centered ourselves for what was to become the energetic apheleon of our lives.
5	Although lsd usually takes an hour to come on strongly with me, I was beginning to get serious teeth chatter and body shaking within 15 minutes.  The tea made me have to piss, and when I stood up from the circle I tried to walk down the hall to the bathroom.  Already quite confused, I stumbled in the hallway and landed on B's bed (fortunately).  My friends were very concerned about the noise, but I assured them that I was OK as I burst into nervous laughter.
6	In the bathroom, the lights were out but just enough candle light came in for me to make out the fixtures.  Within seconds, my mind was tricked into thinking that the walls and doors had become some sort of 'ice'.  I started thinking of how get out, but then figured out where the door was and proceeded back down the hall to rejoin the group.  The group I came back to had been rapidly accelerating as well.  We joked about how crazy this was already becoming within 20 minutes of ingestion.  Little did we know.  The next hour or so are pretty vague in my memory.  First of all, an ice storm began to rage outside (literally).  We were marvelling at how the weather was mimicking our mental meteorology.  All of a sudden, the power went out.
7	We weren't too upset about the light because we were already on candle power, but the music went and the heat went almost as quickly.  This led to some confused negotiations about leaving or staying B's tiny and cold house.  We were pacing about the place, and in and out of the front door.  No one had any destination or idea what was happening.  B suggested we sit in his pathfinder to warm up for a moment.  We all piled in and the heat felt good.  While seated in the back with H, I was being taken down a tunnel into darkness at high velocity.  It looked as though I was levitating and flying over infinite rows of seats in a theatre with a luminous screen.  There was no sense of actual body.  When I tried to realize sensations, for example my hand, then I would trap a very vague concept of hand along with some mixed signals of whether or not I could feel my own.  The visuals were extremely intense and there was definitely some concern from B as to how to handle it, as he had never gone so hard or deep before.  Colors were literally pouring out of molecules of thin air and vaporizing into fractals of tangible reality.  There was very little difference between eyes closed and open because it was all becoming one concept.
8	B's confusion became sort of pathological and he wanted it all to end immediately.  E and I, the most experienced out of the Four tried to calm his fears despite our own dealings.  He got paranoid that the neighbors would hear us going in and out, and that the music was too loud (remember, the power was out).  In an effort to make it all stop, B told us to leave, as if he could just go back to sleep and pretend we never showed up with the liquid launch pad.  He literally locked us out, and we heard him rummaging around inside.  We tried to convince him to let us back in and that his idea wasn't going to work, but he wouldn't listen.  E, H, and I had no choice but to drive home.  Woah.
9	Now some people might get concerned that three travelers in our state of mind would take to the road in an ice storm.  H and I seriously questioned whether this was even conceivable, but E assured us that he had it as long as I could back out of B's long, steep driveway.  My black car loomed before us like a dragon, huddled together against the cold.  It breathed and swaths of paisley camoflauge spun off its back.  We got in and began to leave.  E took over the controls once on the road and I in shotgun.  We pumped the drum and bass on my system and let the heat flow.  The experience of moving at high velocity was breath-taking in our heightened state.  Everything visual and tactile was so warped.  Suddenly, H grabbed my shoulder from the back seat and squeezed the hell out of my arm.  With great fear in her voice, she told me she was falling into nothingness.  I tried to calm her down and told her that we would take care of her, but she was really on her own.  Her energy spun me for a loop and I could no longer tell where we were.  I thought seriously how crazy it was getting in B's house, but didn't understand anymore that we were in my car.  E had his shit on lockdown though, cuz we were all of a sudden in my parking lot.  Scared H wanted my keys to get in the house, and I sat back to see if she could figure out how to get in.  She almost started crying but I ran up to show her how to use them.  She looked at me like I was some sort of magician.  
10	Indoors and with power on, we continued to experience massive amounts of spacetime distortion.  While talking to H in one room, I explained how strange it was upstairs and she told me I hadn't been up there yet.  I started to geek out at how confusing it was on this unprecedented level of tryptamine infusion.  We couldn't decide on what was really happening, so at some point we just chose to surrender to the hyperreal vortex of particles and energy.  My sober roommate awoke to have us turn down the music.  We just started laughing at how he floated in and out of the universe we created.  Until we saw him, no one had even considered the possibility that there were others in this place who weren't experiencing the same thing.  In my mind, there was absolutely no concept of sobriety left, and all sense of ego was dissolved.
11	We went to my room to sit and enjoy the ride.  H dissolved into the bed and didn't move for the longest time.  E and I just looked around the room and felt.  My room, lights on, was transformed into a 4 walled patio with a perfectly clear and starry night sky overhead.  Don't ask how, it just was.  B called my house and said that he had calmed down and wanted some company again.  We told him to ride on over if he felt comfortable driving.  He was down and 20 minutes later was at the door.  Upstairs we all synthesized some incredible energy flow and transfer.  H finally snapped back into our consciousness with a big smile on her face.  She said she had gotten lost in the bed, but was glad to be back.  The positivity we felt after getting through the first few hours was incredible.  For an hour in that room, we just sat in silence and looked around.  It was the surface of an alien planet in a time when none of us existed.  The speed and variation of the visuals was sooooo intense.  One thing I remarked about using lsd of this concentration is that the crystalline structure of my visual field was composed mostly of large pieces.  This is one reason why it made it so difficult to discern what the physical world was.  LSD of a lesser concentration seems to appear as smaller particles which allow one to see what objects are versus space.  
12	After what seemed like eons, we realized dawn was breaking outside and we wanted to go for a stroll.  Up we walked on the slick street behind my house.  The trees were totally encased in ice down to the last twig.  The sun reflecting through this giant prism was unforgettable and amazingly beautiful.  All of a sudden, we heard a loud 'crack', and an enormous tree (70' oak) fell across the street right behind us in slow motion.  The noise and sight were unbelieveable, drugs or no drugs!  We were so awe-struck, that we questioned whether it had really happened or not.  After a minute of playing on the tree, we chose for it to be real.  It entirely blocked the street and narrowly missed crushing two parked cars.  We continued walking.  Sometimes I felt too conspicuous to be outdoors whilst blowing up so hard.  I thought that I was throwing up my insides and turning back out in a continuous cycle of mental v physical awareness.  It proceeded like a hollow, flexible and crystalline cylinder at light speed through the universe...continuously rolling and sliding in impossibly complex patterns, such was my consciousness.  The meditation was intense and beautiful.
13	Later in the morning, we tried to eat at a restaurant.  My buckwheat pancakes were more interesting to look at then to eat.  They tasted like air, but were hard to swallow.  On the surface of each blue-violet circle I could see new worlds forming and dissipating.  I remembered reading about how it would look if you peered out of a black hole into which you were falling.  Before the event horizon, you would see galaxies' birth and death in firework-like speed and splendor.  E, being the old master that he is, ate my breakfast as well as his own.  After another hour or so of kickin it back home we all split up.  H and I showered together and then hit the bed.  E and B flew away for the time being.  In bed, we made love with pure and energetic spheres of radiance around us.  The soft one and I drifted off into a light sleep with surprisingly little resistance, exhausted and clean.
14	I awoke around 3pm with a start after a 4 hour nap.  The visuals were still very noticeable although nowhere near as intense as the peak hours of madness.  I had an overwhelming feeling of calm and purity to the point where I cried lightly a few times.  We just kicked it inside my lovely little apartment smoking high-grade herb and snacking on real foods to replenish ourselves.  E and B later came over to revel in the afterglory.  It taught all of us alot about ourselves and brought us even closer together as friends.  Throughout the previous night and forever afterward, we would ask E how many hits he actually put on our space treats.  With his mischievous smile he would reply 'just 2'.  Later he would ask us, 'just 2?', and then laugh his ass off.
15	I recommend taking smaller, known doses for the uninitiated.  For the experienced traveler...well, sometimes you just see where or when the path leads you.  Overall, it lasted for ~20hrs before totally leaving us, thus the day after was still very interesting.  That night of the ice storm is called 'lsd death night' by H and B, but E and I call it 'automatic ice'.  It took me to the edge of sanity for a long time.  I loved the person that I found there, and we emerged together with a profound love for life and the Earth.  The harmony of existence is infinite.  Here is something that made me cry the next day in light of the experience, I hope you enjoy it as I did:

17	The beginning of summer in 2000, memorial day weekend to be exact, I consciously left my body on journey of an alternative reality.  My setting was a music festival in California.  I thought I was injesting 10-20 hits of good liquid LSD.  I find out later I got a 'Chunk' in the last of the bottle.  A tiny little Crystal of LSD.
18	I really don't think I was in the appropriate setting for this type of extensive interfacing but there I was.  In the Moment.  Past Present and Future lined up into one and created a lattice work of moving eternity so I jumped on.  I went through many synchronicities lining up people in my life events coming into place.  At one point in the reality I was in I Birthed universes for the future or past or the infinte.  Time has a funny way of bending and contorting in this altered state.  
19	The birthing process brought me closer to oneness.  I had a hard time re-entering my body.  Everything turned to ones and zero's and negitive one like on the internet.  I actually felt like The planet had a big net over it and to re-enter I had to go through it.  Very unpleasent in a digital way.  The most interesting thing happened to me after this experience.  My eye color changed for three days.  I have green eyes and after this experience I had bright piercing electric blue eyes.  People around me were commenting as well as my boyfriend.
20	I have made an explanation to my self about this.  How scientifically sound it is I don't know.  I know lighter eyes let more light in them.  So on my journey I believe I interfaced so much with so much light(truth) that my eye color adapted to that frequency of learning on that level.  As far as set and setting, the universes I birthed there was me pissing my self here, I ended up hanging out with rock med.  I would not trade my experience for ANYTHING.  I also woundn't take such a high dosage of any thing in a festival setting with out someplace to go where you can let it all out if need be.  It is important to have acess to a space on this demension that can haddle your body mimicking what is going on in other demensions you may be traveling. I use this and all other alternative reality experiences every day to further the study of self. 
21	It is funny how one experience can impact you so intensely that it is still teaching you in a year.  This memorial day weekend I attended MINDSTATES2.

23	LSD (2) : Festival / Lg. Crowd (24), General (1)
24	This was about my seventh time Tripping on LSD. After doing many purple geltabs, which i found to be very powerful, and not tripping off the papertabs I've taken, i thought papers were useless. But I was wrong, I just hadn't found the right ones yet. That is until this weekend a month ago.  A friend of mine had a little house party in which 10-15 people come, drink, smoke some maryjane, and socialize. He throws these get-togethers often. Well.. I am 17 and was almost a full blown alcoholic, so I eased on it and got into LSD, MDMA, etc... So me, and 3 other friends decided to get some Acid, while everyone else drank. (Something we do quite often)
25	Me and JB road over to a friend of his, getting a total of 20 hits. (10 were for money-making purposes to pay for ours.) This was Jonathon's first time tripping. While at the dealer's house, he specifically said, 'I don't care how much you usually take, do NoT take more than two of these.' This means alot coming from him, a daily tripper.
26	Well, I'm not one to follow standards, so i took my 5. Derek took 2, and Jonathon took 1. We lost JB somewhere along the way. I went to a bedroom alone and turned on the strobe and some techno. Regular house shot mostly. I waited a half hour and just had that queezy feeling I always seem to get in my stomach before I trip. I was trying to make myself trip, by staring at things in the room hard, and zoning out(when will I learn to just sit and be patient). Well after that half hour i got up and went to the living room where everyone was watching 'body shots' a clubbin' flick. Although i didn't like this atmosphere of no music or pretty lighting effects, i layed on the floor and watched on.  Then the shit hit me so hard, I haven't ever felt like this before. For the first time in my life I got the thought for a split second, 'maybe I took a few too many'. But that thought disappeared within about a minute. Things in the house that usually only became visual for certain periods of time were constantly flowing and moving. The carpet was seemingly alive, and I found myself to be doing odd things. 
27	This Acid was so different to me, It gave me a very strong body trip and mental trip, along with more visuals than the other acid I've done.  My body was feeling very weak yet so amazingly tingly. Like a shiver, but constant.  The sky became a flat purple color, and trees were flat black and cartoony. I am not used to this, but I was enjoying myself. We ended up having to leave ( drunk people need sleep) around 2am.  Driving was so scary yet completely amazing. I've ridden while tripping before, but this seemed different. We landed at an abandoned trailer on a backroad right behind a wild animal park.  The sounds of peacocks were so odd to hear while tripping.  Then my vision became completely altered, I was seeing things in like a purple writing, but shaped the way they really were supposed to be. Like comparable to the writing in the film 'MATRIX'. I was stunned, and this made me and LSD a closer companion. The night went on till about 7:30am, which started at about 11pm. The outcome was, we lost Derek along the way, and it was me and Jonathon at a gas station about 45 miles away from home. We had the ridiculous idea to follow a semi on the interstate to see where he was going.  After it war off, I had no come down, or even a burned out feel. I was amazed, and because of this I love LSD more than ever. 
28	Ever since my first trip I had a different outlook on everything. Ever since this trip, I didn't have a comedown at all. So, I found a great companion.  Enjoy your LSD everyone, and please be safe. Driving is not a good idea and we shouldn't have done it. Thanks.

30	well, when i took my second trip, I did 5 hits while walking in the forest, and as i was coming up, and walking over a bridge, i drew the lsd molecule on the railing and wrote 'albert hofmann is my father' as a joke. i'm not gonna go into too much detail on the visuals, because they weren't too much different from last time, and i'm sure anyone who's done acid know about 'em already... mainly mandalas and and peoples faces moving around. I watched trainspotting with my sitter (he was somewhat concerned due to the disturbing imagery, but for some reason i've always found that movie to be kind of life affirming and good), but i couldn't really keep track of what was going on. while watching the movie a made a few realizations: 
31	The first was that evolution is a self anihilating concept, in that the species which becomes dominant inevitably destroys itself, allowing the process to start over again. 
32	The second, which i realized as i pet my dog and was overwhelmed
33	by the vast amount of pure, unconditional love pouring from him, was that we are all one being, experiencing itself for the sheer joy of it, which led me to the third revelation, that the point of life (or at least mine) is to be happy and to make others happy. which is why i can't stand those who disregard others feelings and only persue their own pleasure.
34	As my sitter left, we talked a little, and i was nearly brought to tears by his kindness in watching me, and allowing me to be myself. I now feel very lucky to have him as a friend, because he has never judged me and he's always supported me in all my decisions.
35	Later, I went to take a shower. I looked at my body and realized how ape like humans really are, and i realized that as much as we revel in our physical achievements, and our physical form, we are, as a people, ashamed of our simian heritage, although many of our postures are those of apes, and squatting on my feet, i could almost feel a tail extending from my spine...
36	overall, it was a very good day, and i hope to repeat the experience before too long, but those 5 hits were the last of the 10 that i got in october and i don't have any money at the moment, so i'll probably end up taking another 3 month stint of sobriety...

38	LSD (2) : General (1), Glowing Experiences (4), Various (28)
39	I recently had a chance to find myself switching roles in an experience I had had on LSD.  I had some younger friends over, who were relatively inexperienced on LSD.  Only two others were on LSD, the other three were just drinking for various reasons.  We had acquired the LSD from a reputable source that evening in liquid form dropped onto sugar cubes.  The two novices took a double dose there and then another an hour later after returning to my house, which I like to think of as a good chill space.  I took one double dose about the time they took their second.  I set up a series of music that I knew would be enjoyable and mind bending, particularly in the acid head space (Orbital, Banco de Gaia, etc).
40	The LSD was very clean and high quality.  It snuck up behind us slowly and then wacked us over the head, sucking our brains into the spirals that wouldn't stop for the rest of the evening.  When I felt mine come on, I just let myself go.  Being slightly off timing of the other two, I settled more into an observer state than trapped into their spirals (tho that would ensue later).  I found it quite humorous to see them trapped in the mindset that we (and they to each other) were 'fucking with them'.  It was funny to me because I remember one trip I had where, even being somewhat experienced on LSD, I felt like the people I was tripping with (whom I had only known through online communications) were messing with me and we were all messing with each other.  In that case as with this, it was never anything malicious or disturbing, but was well summarized in the quote 'Ok, who's fucking with me, is it you or me?'
41	It just made me realize that one shouldn't always try and define or explain the acid head space.  It often leaves one confused.  I enjoyed just observing and letting myself go.  Having come to many interesting understandings in Aikido recently about spirals, shapes, energy flow, and the like, I was able to fit these same thoughts and identify with the same concepts affecting the flow of the LSD space.  The ever elusive point (singularities are a bitch, always gotta remain on the tangent), circular thought patterns, infintite spirals (they're the same whether they are spinning in or out), movement of body, mind, and energy, etc.  It was difficult to explain or put them in a rigid framework, so I just let myself experience them as they came and manifest them in whatever form may be at the time, whether it was dance, thought, manipulation of others (like I said, there wasn't neccessarily any fucking with others, often it just seemed like it, but that doesnt mean it didn't happen, cause it's fun when you get it right), or Aikido shapes/forms.  
42	It was just interesting to see the same strugglings that I have been through, evidenced in these two, and to provide the chill space where one could just deal with it. I'm not trying to sound like an elitist bastard (albeit I am one), but I take the lessons from LSD to my heart, and they do help me integrate my reality and how I interact with it.  My presence of mind is greatly aided by a dissolution of self and the reconstruction of intent and structure. It was refreshing to see where I had come from, and where my mind and self have developed since then.  Not to say it's not possible for me to get caught in the same spirals, they're always there.  It was just fun to play the observer.

44	I've recently read about Trey's experience on mixing LSD with mescaline, something about his recollection struck me as to how similar it was to mine, only I had just taken LSD alone.  One afternoon myself and a close friend did some acid, and experienced the usual tale of warped images, however approx 6 hours later when I thought that the effects were begining to dissipate, I was astounded to see something which was amazing and uncontrollable - and ultimately emotionally stunning. No matter how much I tried to change my focus on to something else, the things I were seeing remained.  These things or thing, was in fact a jelly like sheen which coated my whole body, which I could only detect by sight (at first).  It looked like what I imagine a drop of milk would look like suspended in geletine, sort of forming a minute yet complex white misty cloud, it hovered about an inch above my skin (not my clothes)  As I began to explore this occurence more closely - by looking at my fingers, I saw fleeting electrical sparks, the smallest I have ever seen, these electrical sparks seemed to be thinner than the finest hair and lasting only a fraction of a fraction of a second.  
45	I later began to feel a strong electrical presence in the room (no sound) just a kind of what I would describe as a 'biological white noise' This white noise grew immense and loud - this is not auditory loud, it's more of a loud silence, maybe the opposite of sound?  anyway, I felt it engulf me and take me to the most euphoric place I have ever been, I sensed that this place was unlike the 3 dimensional life that I knew of, but more of a place where everying is purely emotional - purely thought - no mass no space.  Whilst in this place, I was convinced that the other presence formed part of me, and alway had been with me. Like Trey I felt that this presence was happy to know that I could finally acknowledge it.

47	It all started off innocently enough.  I was going to St. George, Utah, to pick up a friend and go to Vegas for a fun filled weekend of smoking weed, cruising the strip, and a Phish concert.  Prior to this trip I had never even considered taking acid.
48	Friday morning we left St. George and headed for Vegas.  We smoked some shwag on the way down the canyon and jammed to the Doors, and talked nonsense till we got to Vegas.  When we got to Vegas we met up with some mutual friends, one of which attends UNLV and lives in the dorms, which is where we slept.  Friday night everyone found tickets to the Phish show, so we all went and had an awsome time.
49	Saturday morning we woke up late and sat around reminiscing about how cool the concert was.  We all decided we would try to get tickets to the Saturday night show.  Then my friend D pulled out a little bottle and smiled at me.  He asked me if I wanted to do some acid.  It was a very interesting thought, I had never really considered it before.  I had only smoked pot about three times before this trip.  I asked everyone what it was like and about all I could gather from them was that it was 'crazy,' 'intense,' and that I would be a different person after.  I thought for about fifteen minutes and decided to go for it.  D put two drops from the little breath freshener bottle on my tounge.  I rubbed it around my mouth and swallowed.  'That's it?' I asked.  'Thats it,' D said.  The friend I drove down from St. George also took one hit.
50	I asked why no one else was doing it and they explained that you develop tolerance and they didn't want to have to do twice as much to get the same effect.  I had no idea the night before that they were all tripping.  At first I had the feeling that nothing was going to happen.  They just told me to hold on and it would work.  About a half hour after taking the acid, things started to happen.  The first effect I noticed was that a blue chair in the room seemed much more blue.  It was strange but not alarming.  Then I laughed my ass off as I watched my friend B roll a joint.  It was so funny that he had these finely tuned 'joint rolling skills.'   Then we set off on what would be the strangest journey of my life.
51	As we set off across the parking lot the sun was high and hot, about 1:00 in the afternoon.  I could sense things much better.  I could feel the heat from the pavement and the sun was brighter.
52	There was quite a while before the show, so we decided to just chill and walk around the parking lot amongst all the Phish heads.  We picked a nice grassy hill partialy in the shade and by a big 'friendly' rock.  This is when I started to peak.
53	I sat among my friends, on a small grassy hill, partly in the shade of my friend the pine tree, and by my friend the rock.  I looked around and the trees started to dance and the grass seemed to flow like a gently, peacefully, rolling stream.  All the people relaxing around me were very beautiful.  It was one of the happiest moments I've ever had.  Everyone and everything were happy to be there sharing in each others' company.
54	Someone suggested that we go exploring and I was happy with doing anything.  We walked around all the campers and busses and did some people watching.  It was a very surreal experience.  Walking around thinking crazy stuff, all the dealers wispering 'acid, shrooms, extacy' at us.  Then it happened:  I was lost.  Four hundred miles from home, tripping balls, and I was lost.  I tried to stay calm and was fairly successful.  I just remembered I was on drugs and they would go away sooner or later.  Finally I found my friends without incident and we went back and chilled on the grass which was very relieving.  We didn't find tickets to the show but I was content for I had had my own little 'show.'
55	I think I will definitely do acid again some time.  It is quite an experience, but do some research before you try it.

57	LSD (2) : Festival / Lg. Crowd (24), First Times (2), General (1)
58	I was not at all an experienced drug user. It was my freshman year in high school and I had been smoking weed for approximately 2 years and I drank, but that's as far as my drug use went. Well, I had been wanting to try harder and better things for a while and then my friend gave me 2 geltabs (I cannot recall what kind, but someone I know who has tripped over 120 times told me it was very strong!). Well, it was after school and I was alone so I decided not to take it.
59	The next day in school I realized I still had the 2 tabs on me. I was really bored and it was right after 2nd period, 10 am. I told my druggie friend what I had and she told me to take it. I thought it sounded like a good idea since I figured she could take care of me if something went really wrong, and I was really bored. Well, I popped both in my mouth. Not much later, I started feeling crazy and out of control. Everything looked really funny. They took me to the locker room in the gym and I sat there and started bugging out. They knew it was a bad idea for me to go to class, so I just sat there. I started seeing all sorts of crazy things, even though none of it was there. I was really scared and I realized I was fucked up badly. The teacher came in to yell that we couldn't just sit there, we had to go to class. I saw monkeys dancing around and a dog on the floor. 
60	My friends realized that if an official saw me they would know I was fucked up. They tried to take me out of the locker room but I was too busy crying that the dog couldn't come with us. They picked me up and dragged me out of there. They decided to bring me to lunch where I could sit and relax. But the walls in my school were really curvy and there are like a million turns. I kept feeling as though the walls were going to get me and hit me. Then I finally got to the stairs and they totally bugged me out. I refused to walk and began to crawl up the stairs. Then they heard the dean start to come to scream for us to get out of the hallways and into class. They knew they couldn't have the dean see me crawling up the stairs so they brought me to the bathroom. I started bugging out in there. 
61	They decided to bring me to my bio lab class and I could sit there because the teacher already knew me and my friends were druggies, so we knew he wouldn't care. I sat at my table just staring at it, thinking there were all sorts of colors even though it was white. The teacher just ignored me. Then I got real hot and went to the window. I was so hot I stuck my whole body out the window and almost fell out. Then the dean came into my class and said they had to speak to me. I was so scared. I left the room and said I wanted my friend that was with me in class to come with me. So they said she could come. They brought me to the bathroom and started questioning why I looked so funny. I said I had been sick and vomited and also had an asthma attack. They said ok, they were going to go get the nurse and to stay there. 
62	Now, I wasn't really seing crazy things as much, but I was so scared and nervous and paranoid they would figure out what was wrong. My friend kept trying to calm me down but I just started crying and couldn't stop. Then the nurse and the dean came back and they were like, what's the matter, are you okay? Why are you shaking so much? I said I just didn't feel well and that after my asthma attacks I start to shake because I get myself so worked up and scared, and that I would be fine and I wanted to go back to class. They said no and took me downstairs. They said my friend had to go to class, though. I really didn't want her to leave and started crying again. They took me to the office and made me call my mom. 
63	I told her I just hadn't felt well and I would be fine and she was like, you want me to come pick you up and bring you to the doctor? I was like nooo, because I knew a doctor would figure it out. Well, to make this very long story end, they let me go and suggested to my mom that I get drug tested. After that I was fine and felt better the rest of the day. I learned a lot from that day. I put myself in a bad situation. You should not do something where there is a chance you can get in trouble around a lot of officials and school is not a place for drugs. 
64	If you want to try something or do drugs, don't do them in school. Also, I should have learned more about the drug and the effects and I should have been more prepared for what could happen. I have since done acid again many times and have now done many other drugs as well. I have never again had a bad trip or any other experiences or problems like that and have never come so close to being caught again. That was the worst experience of my life and it taught me a lot of life lessons. It prepared me really well for the drugs I have done since then.

66	LSD (2) : Large Group (10+) (19), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
67	Hi, my name is R, I'm 20 years old and I'm not of English origin so I apologise in advance for any typos or misspelling.
68	I practice yoga and meditation every once in a while, I belive I am in good physical condition and I eat well, I have experience with MDMA, cocaine, ketamine, speed paste, LSD, mushrooms ;), and some research cuemicals that were sold as MDMA and LSD although I don't do coke any more nor will I for the rest of my life as I realised it's absolute crap and I don't really get what I'm paying for and yes I've had good coke.
69	It all started at 1:45am when I was waiting to get picked up to go to a psychedelic trance rave some kms away from my house. As I wait I stretch for a bit. I get picked up and driven to the place, none of the other people in the car went with be but they had some acid and I had some money so I bought 5 hits. I drop one as soon as we arrive there which was at about 2:15am. As I pay my entry and observe what's going on, I go upstairs to the balcony and immediately run into an aquaintance of mine and I give her a big hug and spin her around ahahah it felt great.  
70	At this point I was starting to heavily come up. The acid I was doing were Hoffman's, they have been advertised as 300mcg but I've done good LSD and from personal experience I know it's not the case but nevertheless they are good, the only downside to these Hoffman's are that they don't produce much visuals but the high is great! (The tabs had no taste whatsoever).
71	I start running into my friends and since I didn't have any weed on me I asked them to roll us a joint, which they did, they even let me roll it, at this point I was already tingling and in the mood to dance so we smoke the joint and go back downstairs. The music is great. I danced the night away and in-between 2am and 6am I dropped 3.5 tabs and gave the rest to my friends. in-between 2am and 6am I dropped 3.5 tabs and gave the rest to my friends. Almost everyone in that party was either on MDMA or acid and the music was great.
72	The only visuals I got during the party was when I was looking at the screen and it had strips of red and blue and green triangles Wich made this trippy cornucopia and kept changing between the two I saw the triangles overlapping the red stripes and when it switched back to the triangles they were in hd and the colour was very vivid. When we left the party we went to smoke some joints at this place that was sheltered from the wind and cold, this happened during November in southern Europe so it was cold but not so cold. After daylight breaks we leave to go to the gas station that was about 2 or 3kms away.
73	Some wierd stuff happend during the process of all that. One of my friends had a bike and I rode it every now and then during the walk to the station and every time I did I started seeing patterns on the ground but not your usual ones like geometric shapes, oh no. These patterns were telling some kind of story that I really didn't understand but ok.  
74	I got home at about 11am, took a shower and went to sleep. I slept for about 3h give or take.
75	When I woke up I had breakfast  and rolled myself a spliff and went to the local park. I smoked a cigarret first, which felt and tasted better than usual then the joint. As I came up from the weed I got a bit of the acid high back and just enjoyed it. At 6:30am I went to church with my family and had a really good experience. At 6:30am I went to church with my family and had a really good experience. I have done this once before on 1g if mushrooms and had an amazing experience. I believe in Jesus tough I am not Catholic. My church has no saints or any images we just sing and praise the Lord almighty. 
76	When I got back home I ate  smoked my other joint and went to bed early at about 10pm, read a chapter of the Bible and went to sleep. I woke up about 15 hours later feeling kinda tired but very relaxed and in a positive mood. I am currently writing this at about 5:30pm on a Sunday.

78	LSD (2) : Rave / Dance Event (18), General (1)
79	After reading all these experiences it made me want to share one of the many experiences I had with LSD or acid as we called it.  I have to say that I was lucky and always stayed within the limits of reasonable dosage when using acid.  This fact is probably the reason why my usage of acid had a rather positive effect on my life.  
80	It was summer, I was about 15 or 16 at the time.  Me and my buddy Francis have already done acid a few times before.  In other words it was one of the first times I tripped on this.  I came to his house around 5 or 6 PM.  He already had the acid and was ready to drop it.  So we did.  
81	After half an hour or so I started feeling queasy an anxious.  A little time after that I started to laugh like crazy for no apparent reasons; basically I just looked at my buddies face (and he was so stoned!) and started to laugh and laugh...it was really funny.  After this insane laughing trip I started looking at some books and thats when the visuals kicked in.  It made no sense.  The letters were moving back and forth fucking up my perception.  At one point I thought I was reading thoughts from my unconscious. At one point I thought I was reading thoughts from my unconscious.  I was amazed by this feeling...overwhelmed I would say.  I felt like a... Recipient of ice cream, and I could dig inside myself, digging out secrets I didn't know of but were there after all.  After putting the book down I started to see things which made me ecstatic.  I had visions of big city landscapes.  I could see it clearly; buildings and skyscrapers in front of me in a distance.  And this is kinda funny 'cause a couple of years later I moved out in the big city...kinda strange.  
82	After a few hours my buddy got tired of me and kicked me out.  So I called up my dad and he came and picked me up.  The ride home was hell: my father was casually talking to me as I was seeing the street lights growing bigger and bigger.  Everything was kinda yellowish and the light poles were deformed.  I also had the feeling that the car was going very slowly but it as rolling at a normal pace.  
83	Finally when I came home my dad went to bed but I was still wide awake.  The rest of the trip was in my room.  At first the ceiling fan made me trip for awhile.  Then colors in the ceiling started to appear.  But the thing that made me trip the most is when I passed in front of the mirror.  I stopped and looked at my face only to realize it wasn't my face!  And it was constantly changing. Faces of people I never seen before appeared in the mirror Faces of people I never seen before appeared in the mirror with a kaleidoscope effect.  Then my face morphed and melted.  
84	When I think about this trip and any other acid trip I made in my life; it always made me realize something about myself or our beautiful mother earth or the universe.  This particular trip made me see I had a changing personality.  Which is true.  As I grow older I can't help but realize that I am an unstable human being constantly changing and evolving...Anyways every trip was a revelation.  I love it and I can't wait the proper moment to do it again!

86	I took notes during a recent LSD trip. This is the transcript. 
87	5:00 p.m. Take half a tab, instant light high.
88	5:20 p.m. Everything is visually sharper and more vibrant than usual, some floating neon patches of color.
89	5:45 p.m. Colors even more vibrant, heart racing, warm feeling in chest. 
90	6:15 p.m. The effects seem to be getting stronger with each mood boost that comes over me The effects seem to be getting stronger with each mood boost that comes over me (the strengthening in intensity definately seems to be caused by the mood boosts, not the other way around). I choose to go outside.
91	6:50 p.m. After locking myself out of house, come back and peak 
92	6:57 p.m. No longer doubt if 'it's working.' I'm riding my bike and it feels like the pedals are getting taller and shorter, very intense.
93	8:08 p.m. Yep, everything makes sense now, I'm sitting on a bench by the river listening go the JCS soundtrack and smoking a cig and I feel so good, everything is perfect. 
94	9:40 p.m. Vivid patterns in the darkness, lose some sense of spatial reality (dreamlike) 
95	9:44 p.m. Grasp the magnitude and power of the Willamette river for the first time ever on the Autzen footbridge.
96	12:21 a.m. Don't try to communicate with non living beings, success would result in a complete psychotic break. 
97	1:43 p.m. Haven't slept, still having tactile hallucinations (things I'm wearing or touching melting into me) the visuals are mostly subtle.
98	2:57 p.m. I swear the objects are creaking more than usual. 
99	3:01 p.m. It feels like most everyone else is just saying 'come on, get on with it' when it comes to collective consciousness, but only for fleeting moments. Everything has been synced up all night Everything has been synced up all night (my thought patterns with the noises coming from the inanimate objects, as if to punctuate the thoughts) it makes some of what I'm thinking seem very meaningful. Reinforces my belief that psychedelics activate some sort of extra sensory perception, or that taking them encourages other forms of consciousness to attempt contact. 
100	"[Reported Dose: ""1/2 tab, very STRONG stuff really soaked it good""]"
101	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
102	Took two doses about 5:30 p.m. on the familiar 'ride up' I knew this liquid was going to be very potent. 
103	My buddy turned on some Grateful Dead and I was comforted by the familiar sounds. M put that music on at just the right point because just as I was starting to peak the music turned into an orchestra of twisting clocks. My eyes were closed and this shift in music made me very uncomfortable.  My mind was reeling in on itself to an almost unbearable pitch. 
104	Just when I felt like I might scream uncontrollably everything cleared away effortlessly.  My body-mind became light and buoyant. I felt a peace like no other wash over me softly, and as it did the top of my head opened like a lotus. I felt a peace like no other wash over me softly, and as it did the top of my head opened like a lotus. This was a very odd feeling looking back, but at the moment it felt perfectly natural. My spirit or energy or consciousness or whatever float  upwards out of my body into space. I felt at total peace gazing out at the stars and all of creation. 
105	Then out of the inky blackness a small point of something appeared. This small point grew out symmetrically into these beautiful delicate hands that seemed to have a rainbow aura. More hands radiated outwards some were open with beautiful strange eyes looking at me some held things some held many things like somehow multiple things could fill one space. Outward until a full image of a magnificent being of golden light with many arms and hands appeared.  
106	This was more than a bit scary to me. It was simply too much to behold. I opened my eyes and I was almost completely sober!

109	11:11pm Make a wish. Dropped the tab [1 acid tab ungrateful dead]. 
110	11:47 pm I thought I wasnt feeling anything but my neck feels odd. I almost feel very lightly nauseous but I know it will pass I think its because I didnt eat much before only pizza about 5 hours ago. My hand eye coordination is staring to lag as noticed from typing on the computer and talking to a friend. 
111	11:58 pm Pupils larger. Feeling weirder. Starting 2 trip.
112	12:17 am Done texting. Time to let go. Hard to type. I just feel weird. Everything is on a slant.
113	12:19 am Hearing and seeing trails if that makes sense. Hyper aware. Slipping further into it. Pupils dilated. I cant tell if I have to pee or not lol.
114	12:29 am Woahh its only been 10 minutes lol. Im deff tripping now. Grinding my teeth a lot. 
115	12:43 am Staring the movie Waking Life. Tired of electronics. 12:43 am Staring the movie Waking Life. Tired of electronics. 
116	2:38 am Waking Life was intense. Really hungry I wish I could sort that. Im surprised I can type. Everything is moving in little circles. Trying to play Grand Theft Auto now. Really super sensitive to all the ambient music this thing makes. Everything is melting like in Waking Life loll. 
117	4:06 am Starting to come down. Pupils still very large. 
118	4:46 am Still grinding teeth, ears still keen on music and my Dream Sequens' by NMESH cassettes. I wish it wasnt almost 5am. I have to remind myself I can get it again. Watching Prevue Guide clips and smoking weed. 
119	5:52 am Staring into the mirror I somehow became third person. For a second my audio and visual seemed completely static I became the reflection somehow I became the moment I saw the reflection of myself in the mirror and I became the reflection staring back for a second.
120	I did some more dabs and peacefully drifted off to sleep around 7am or so.
121	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
122	 O.K., Been tripping for five years on cid and shrooms, lots of shrooms.This particular experience, happened to be the strongest dose ever.Myself and seven other people, all close freinds, had gathered together for a trip session. A very special occasion since we never get to see each other.A week before, me and three of the others had got the acid and we sampled it. I took one and then another after I had peaked.The best trip that I had ever encountered.Smooth, clean the greatest visuals.Just the three of us on the fourth of july watching the fire works explode in to cosmic angels, chillin with my gal, and haveing revolations beyond my normal symbolic mindscape.Great I thought.The second trip, with all seven of us, had started out different.I thought , hey what the hell, I handled the last one like a pro, why not toss back three or four.No big deal.A few of the others had taken large doses as well.I can feel the first vibes run up and down my body about twenty minutes later.We all were sitting in the living room of the small two bedroom apt.I could barely understand what anyone was saying, I could here their voices but their lips did not move at all.We all experienced this same thing, as we discussed this later.
123	I remember I was afraid that they were against me for some reason and I was afraid to say anything for fear that it might be true.I must have been quiet for an hour into the trip before I got the nerve to pull one of my best friends to another room and make sure that I wasnt insane.I had been trapped in my own fear and insecurities for a long time.What felt like an eternity.I was relieved to find that I was not the only person that was experiencing this.I went outside on the porch to breath the fresh air and get a grip on myself.Soon as I got out there I snapped out of it.I Went back in to discover that my cousin was running around the house swithing the lights on and off saying, Im Jeremy Im going to bed.This would of been fine if he had of stopped.He was stuck in a loop.Thats all he could do, he said the same things over and over again, and could not sit down, as if he could not figure out what he should be doing.LSD unlocks you from the dreadful repititions of boring habitual tendencies,that seem to consume our lives.He wasnt ready.Finally he was convinced to take an enormous bong hit and that did the trick. He snapped right out of it.We all had a giant learning experience that night.First, know what your taking,how strong it is and there is no need for taking more than is necessary.Two, plan out your trips.LSD is not for shits and giggles.
124	It can be negative in a negative environment.LSD is a tool for evolution, and can be used effectively as such. Planning a session, taking the time to do it right is important. We were in a crowded room, we couldnt be loud , we were in an apt.The first time I tripped on this cid it was only the three of us and we were comfortable there. With seven people in a small room , not enough things to occupy us.Ive tripped hard as hell at parties where I almost lost it because of unfamiliar faces and uncomfortable surroundings.Bad tripps are not the effect of the drug, but the effect of the surroundings.

127	Well, this trip started with none other than the overwhelming happiness that always ceases to amaze.
128	I dropped 1.5 tabs at about 4 in the afternoon, turned on Bebop, and I chilled
129	About an hour in I start smiling, this lasts the whole trip.
130	Another hour passes, I walk upstairs, which I love doing because  it involves most of the 5 senses (including my new sixth sense)
131	This 'sixth sense' I refer to is the sense that converts normal senses into other senses.
132	For example sound and touch blended into sight.
133	A kalaidescope of color with the consistency of water flooded my vision.
134	With every new touch, sound, smell, this trip was increased
135	The third of these four hours was most intense.
136	As I looked to the walls of my house while moving through it, I noticed a nob in the cherry-wood that actually morphed into none other than a full-blown skull.
137	This skull started laughing as I grew more and more perplexed with visual.
138	I then start laughing with it (as the body buzz is intense and makes me feel happy no matter what I do)
139	Then, a patchwork of demon-heads, all about the size of a fifty-cent piece formed around the skull and laughed in unison at me.
140	I then went upstairs and decided to come down while talking to my friends.
141	In the last thirty minutes of my extra sense, the watery colors faded and my hands began rapidly changing colors(beleive it or not thats less of a trip than before)
142	Anyway about ten minutes after that my pupils went back to normal and trippiness was over.
143	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
144	Ten strip of really clean, good strong acid.  The best I've ever had. Well this trip went on for a long time, and a lot happened.  But to me, the most interesting part, the most moving part, is described below.
145	I am flying over the ocean.  Not really in a body, just looking down at the ocean from high above.  There's a ship down there.  I'm not really paying attention, not too concerned with whatever is happening.  Somehow, I know that this is the Pacific Theater of World War II.  Somewhere near Japan or the Phillipines. Somehow, I become aware that I am a man on the ship.  There is a violent explosion in which I am killed.  It is very disturbing, I look away, horrified.  It's terrible, terrible.  My body is ripped apart.  It's awful.  I turn away. I'm up in the sky looking down.
146	Now I am in a dark underground cave.  There are many people here.  We are all dead.  A huge crowd of dead people, standing around, frowning. It feels sketchy here.  Not like we are in Hell, but this is not a nice place.  I think, 'This is Sheol.'  It's like a waiting room.  I want to leave. It's like a waiting room.  I want to leave.   But you're not allowed to.  There are these monsters guarding us.  They look like big disembodied mouths, with snaggly teeth, drooling slime and blood, hovering above the ground.
147	I go right up to one and assert, 'Angels are real!  Angels exist!'  I don't know why I said this.  I was not raised religious and did not believe in such things. It says something to me in an aside, like it doesn't want anyone else to hear, 'Well I don't doubt it.'  And then it stands aside and lets me walk out of there.
148	Now I am floating, ascending upwards through many red and gold spinning pentagrams. I pop out in a vast open space.  There is bright light everywhere, so I can hardly see anything.  I feel like everything is totally peachy.  I feel great, not scared at all.  This is a wonderful place.  If I was a Christian I would definitely say I was visiting heaven.
149	There are creatures here.  There are no other human beings, as far as I can tell.  The creatures are enormous, the size of a two-storey house.  It's hard to tell what they look like, because their flesh is like looking at the sun.  They best I can describe is that it was like an enormous lion with wings, but that's not really what it is.  It had eyes.  I saw its eyes.  There was more than one of the creatures. They were very benevolent.  They said something to me, to the effect of, 'You can stay here with us forever, if you like.  But we want you to go back.  We want you to reincarnate.  But you don't have to.'  
150	I remember clearly, thinking, 'Ha!  You'd really have to have a screw loose to agree to do that!'  It felt so good to be there, I would never want to leave.  And I certainly wouldn't go back to being a human on Earth!  All the fear, confusion and suffering.  I'd have to literally be insane to agree to go back there.
151	And then *click* all of a sudden I was me again, back in my room, sober. And then *click* all of a sudden I was me again, back in my room, sober.  Guess I agreed.
152	I was curious about what that ship was, and asked about it later when I was tripping.  I saw a man wearing one of those caps that veterans wear, it was blue and it said 'USS ----------'.  I looked it up and sure enough, the USS ---------- was a ship in the Pacific Theater in WWII.  In the early 1940s there was an explosion in which men were killed.  Strangely enough, it happened on my birthday...
153	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
154	I was a High School Freshman boy and was very naive and intruged at all the stuff High School had to offer. I thought High School would be boring since I was only a Freshman and not very popular, but people at this school were very nice and friendly, so getting into crazy stuff was pretty easy.
155	I had an older friend Ill call X. I gotta thank X. He would pretty much do anything for me and this other dorky Freshman and expect nothing in return. One time, me and X were and this other kid were playing Watch Dogs pretty high on weed. We were playing the digital trip and I asked X if we could do Hallucinagens sometime. He said sure, and next weekend he had LSD for us both. 
156	The first stage is the giggles. Everything seemed funny, and I notice the slight effect of my friend moving faster. While giggling hysterically I smushed my face in a pillow. When I looked up from the pillow... It happened. Just like that I was tripping balls. The high is hard to explain. But it is very intense. So intense that it may have even been a bigger part of the trip than the hallucinations. The best way to describe it is that I feel this disoriented, depressed, euphoric, overwhelming, dreamlike, meaty, and spiritually mysterious feeling. That doesn't really give it full justice. I can't really describe it.
157	A lot happened, so I will just give you the most interesting details in no particular order. I very interesting experience was star gazing. Lines formed between the stars forming constellations. But the were not any constellations. They were 3-D. To add even more complexity, they were not actually 3-D, but were made of 2-D lines that gave a sense of depth, like when you draw a cube. To extenuate this perspective effect, the stars were different sizes, so that the bigger ones would be were they would be closer tho the viewer if the shape was 3-D. Another interesting effect was an invisible buffolo on a monocolor TV screen. If you think about it, an infinite variety of shapes make up any shape, because any shape can be cut out of any shape. Well I saw the silhouette of an invisible buffolo on this surface. It was not a different color than the rest of the surface or separated with a line. The screen was still monocolor, but I just saw where the buffolo would be.
158	As well as the visual hallucinations, I also had situational hallucinations. Keep in mind, that hallucinations are not dillusions. You can tell hallucination from reality. But I had a hallucination that X was my dad. I knew he wasn't, and he had no characteristics of my dad that could be detected by the five senses. It more just felt like this whole thing was a dad/son adventure. Music was also very odd. After every lick, it would end out of tune. But even though it was not in tune from a conventional standpoint, it sounded very good in its own unique way.
159	Another amazing thing was that I could not tie my shoes. I knew how to tie them. I was physically able to. I wanted to. I had the willpower, but something was missing. This was so interesting cause it made me consider that there may be many more parts of our brain involved in even mundane tasks that we are not aware of. And I only became aware of one of these parts when it was turned off. I heard there can be much worse side effects, but fortunately the only side effect I had was feeling extremely stuffy. Thankfully we had a bucket of water right by our side, but it mentally felt like I was covered in way to many blankets. That is not a metaphor. It was the physical equivalent of that, but in my brain. But other than that small discomfort, it was pretty fun.

162	I had recently purchased 1 trip of liquid acid from my friend. I had always wanted to trip on acid. I bought 1 trip and 3.5 grams of hydro weed. So, I rolled the weed into 2 blunts. I smoked one with my friend. He left shortly after so I dropped the acid.
163	About 45 minuted later I was tripping. It was night time and my and my friend left the woods and the leaves and trees gave off a metallic glow. Then I felt psychic. My friends were at a school sitting down when I called them. I said 'the cops will come meet me at arrowhead park' after that I had a vision where police dogs arrested all of them and I was there getting maced. So I sat down at the park and meditated. I saw lots of closed eye visuals including a green 'W' which was everywhere.
164	Then people started shooting off fireworks and I got scared and ran away. After that I had psychic visions of God,Moses, and all religious dietes telling me that I was the chosen one and to lead the enslaves people to The Sea of Tides. I was also felling very happy, the greatest I have ever felt. I smoked my second blunt and thats where the colored trails set in. The were everywhere. Then I started spacing out and I saw a glowing larve come out of a door with a huge eye in the middle. The eye was telling me to join forces with it in the battle against evil. It was weird but also cool.
165	I went home and started playing 'spyro The Dragon' for PS1. The dragon was flying out of the tv and around the room. Then I started to come down about 4.5 hours later. Aparently it wasn't the best acid but it was all I could get ahold of. This was by far the greatest experience of my life.

168	I was 22. Had just moved in with my boyfriend into a building that was being gentrified from a former crack house to the standard yuppie apartments (we had bullet holes in one window). As the renovations were ongoing for our time there it was rarely quiet and often workers walked in and out of our residence unannounced. But the day previous they stated they all had Sunday off, so that was when we decided to do our acid.
169	Unfortunately my mind set was much as it is now and always has been. Depressed, anxious, paranoid, and pessimistic. I try to keep all that at bay and enjoy my life, but its difficult. So that Sunday morning with a freshly neat and cleaned apartment my boyfriend gave me two and half little pieces of paper. I put them in my mouth and left them for half an hour. He did the same.
170	At first it was nice. It was sunny out. A warm late spring day in the midwest. Sun was streaming through the windows. I was with the man I loved and would eventually marry. I felt nice and cozy. The cat was on my lap purring. Just laying there purring. I wasn't even petting her. We decided to paint. Make some music. Draw some. Just do as we pleased.
171	I honestly have no recollection of how it happened, but I found myself naked as the day as I was born and just laying on our bed. I was perfectly content to stare at the textures of the ceiling. Then someone knocked on the door. It seemed impossibly loud. My boyfriend hurriedly put his pants back and on and went to the door. The workers decided to try and get some time and a half pay. They were working Sunday.
172	I heard all this while cowering naked in the closet and desperately clutching my confused cat for comfort. My man came back and tried to calm me down. It did not work.
173	We returned to the bed (I had replaced my clothing), the cat sticking by my side for some reason, and tried to again find the calm comfy place we were. I couldn't find it. I could hear everything at once. Screaming children, running faucets, footsteps, conversations, the pipes being worked on downstairs and it all came from everywhere and nowhere. It was horrible. I started to cry. I thought of the sharks sticker in the bathroom, the bullet holes in the window, the phantom image of a toddler running by it I had experienced much earlier and while not all drug impaired. I decided then that he had been shot to death and cried even harder.
174	The cat nuzzled my face and emitted a worried little meow in my direction. This for some reason struck me as hilarious. I then proceeded to laugh hysterically for approximately 15 minutes. 
175	At the site of my mate's worried face I then flipped into sobbing mode for a few minutes. Eventually the groaning, whining, screeching, and banging caused from the plumbing work below began to disturb him as well. It sounded like it was in our bathroom. The footsteps seemed to be in our hall. We looked but no one was there.
176	We relocated ourselves to the front room and sat in front of the big windows and just basked in the sun for awhile. I was feeling pretty good. Then I heard a woman scream. Heard a kid being smacked. Heard a baby cry. I looked out and saw the beautiful tall old trees, taller than our building, and thought of all the horrible human mess below. I then proceeded to cry non-step for more than half an hour.
177	We tried listening to music. It sounded like the musician was standing next to me, singing the words directly into my ear. I could not stand the sensation. We shut it off.
178	Somehow I gave in to my man's request for sexual intercourse. I found myself naked on the bed again. I felt like I was going to sink into the mattress like someone sinks into quicksand and I assumed I would be suffocated. It took an intense effort to keep myself sane enough to recongnize the fear as completely insane. Then he was doing what guy's do and I was enduring it. I usually love it. I felt like my limbs were shrinking. Like rapidly deflating balloons and that my skull was collapsing. I thought he was going to meld with me like two plastic pieces being melted and stuck together forever. I felt like my limbs were shrinking. Like rapidly deflating balloons and that my skull was collapsing. I thought he was going to meld with me like two plastic pieces being melted and stuck together forever. We'd be like siamese twins conected at the genitals. I focused on staying calm. I heard footsteps, but disregarded them. I heard a man laugh. A man say, 'There indisposed.' Then a door close. I still do not know whether or not a worker walked in and witnessed or drugged copulation or if it was a hallucination.
179	For the remainder of the trip we retreated to a newly empty room of the house. My man's schizo brother had moved back in with his mommy and taken his stuff with him. The large empty minimalist space soothed my mind and my racing heart. We sat on the floor and just stared at each other. Waiting out the unpleasantness. We seemed to read each other's mind. I leaned on the window while he went to use the toilet and was horrified at how I actually did want to do the cliche. I felt my body wanting to toss itself out the window and I fought with my hands to not open it and help me through. It was no death wish. There was a crack dealer standing below. It ocurred to me that it would be hilarious for a drugged chick to land on him and smash him.
180	Fianlly, after 9 horrible hours the trip ended. I had never felt my depression, paranoia, and anxiety at a more intense level than when I was on LSD. I'm 26 now and still have never taken it again. And I never will.

183	I'd like to talk about my first, and thusfar only LSD trip. To set the mood, I'll say that this was at college, on my birthday (a bit more than a week away from the end of school), we were still living in dorms, I had only just the week prior heard that we might have access to LSD, and I was the only one of my friends brave enough to try it (everyone was worried about flashbacks, but the research I did suggested that they really wouldn't be too bad, if at all). We're a strong group of friends, tightly knit. These were the guys that introduced me to weed, etc. My first true friends, due to my awful experiences in high school.
184	Anyway, I awaken for my birthday, the tab already stored away in my fridge, I picked up my brand new grinder from the post office, I check through my mail, and I've gotten an email from a Google recruiter (quick opportunity to call my mom so I don't have to ignore her all day). Oh yeah, and it was an absolutely GORGEOUS day - high of 62*F, sunny (so it was absolutely comfortable to be out in pants and a t-shirt), this was looking good. I emptied my pockets of all but my wallet and keys, and popped the tab in my mouth at 12:00 noon. (so that t+1 would be 1:00, etc.). I chilled on my couch with a few of my friends waiting around for the inevitable, all while wondering if I had just eaten a piece of paper...
185	Fast forward to about 1:00. Still haven't felt any effects, although I obviously didn't know what I was looking for exactly. Until the shadow behind the towel on the wall started to shift and colorcycle just slightly. It wasn't much, but I knew I was in for a ride. At that point, I only had fairly vague visuals (things colorcycled, but only within a small range of colors), and I could feel my mind starting to run in interesting ways fairly quickly (Two good quotes from me: 'I was going to ask you what color the poster was, but then I realized your answer could not be satisfying to me.' and 'How come words don't look like words upside down, they look like upside down words?'). I enjoyed staring at the walls for a bit, but then decided to start my adventure.
186	First stop, my friend who lived across the hall from me. She showed me that IBM video explaining logarithms - basically it's a shot of zooming way out on a couple enjoying a picnic, all the way to the universe scale, then zooming way in to the subatomic scale. That absolutely captured me, and did color a lot of my thoughts throughout the day. A few other videos weren't as appealing, and we all decided it would be a good time to go outside.
187	It's me and three of my friends, we make it out of the door of the dorm, and we run into our RA in short order. I crack up, thinking about how she has no idea what's going on inside my head. We run a little later into more RA's doing an area program involving, as far as I recall, watersports and freezepops - neither of which interested me at the time. One of my friends goes off to get a freeze pop, and I think at that point had to go to class, so goes off towards academic side while the rest of us head off through the woods. I should mention, that in my mind, it's absolutely amazing looking at all the people around, thinking about what they're thinking, thinking about how visible I am to myself, and how basically invisible I am to everyone else, and being put into a damn good mood by everyone talking about how they were basically done with classes for the year.
188	We head off to the woods, and I don't know whether it's because of the LSD, or the weather, but it seems to me like everything is just a hell of a lot more GREEN in there. Everything was growing in, and I really hadn't noticed until then. Plus, although I wasn't feeling much in terms of visuals, all the green that was there was definitely a lot more vibrant a green than I had ever seen before. We take a walk through the woods (often used by stoners, by the way). I notice how damn big one of the robins is. I'm distracted by the movement of just about everything in the forest. We go over to one of the more popular spots in the woods, 'Narnia', which we hadn't been to since I got caught with a bong between my legs about a month back. We had nothing on us, so nothing to worry about. I run through those events a little bit, although in a totally great mood. We also run through the time we met up with a schizophrenic girl back there, and we figured out which tree she jumped out of. A bit more nature enjoyment, and we're off - we keep walking and we catch up with the road around campus to get back to the dorms. Here's where a bit of auditory tripping comes out.
189	Up to that point, everything had been fairly moderate - probably a +. When the auditory trip kicked in, I'd say it went up to a ++. I all of a sudden stopped walking - all of my mind was just as 'there' as it had been all day, but I noticed something funny. I could just barely hear the cars driving right next to me, but the sounds of the forest, the wind blowing through the trees, the birds chirping, etc. all were intensely loud. I started losing my ability to think like normal, and started thinking in 'LSD mode' (which I'll explain a bit later), and came up with some funny idea about how important nature was, and how unimportant the real world was... an idea it was almost impossible to put into words. After a little bit, we keep walking, and we head right back up to my dorm.
190	Physically, at that point, I was red and overheating, people commented that it looked like I had gotten a bit too much sun, but after resting a bit, sweating it off, and keeping with my liquid intake like I had been so careful to do all day, I went back to normal. I should stress this - I was VERY glad to have a ton of those 23oz green tea cans around - I went through alll of the ones I had left, and that was good. Just keep drinking.
191	Back in the dorm, we met up with a few more friends who had been in class up to that point, talked for a bit, and such. My concept of time is a bit fuzzy, but my guess would be that this was around 2-3pm.
192	Basically, chilling at this point involved my sitting on my couch, mostly thinking, occasionally talking with people, and my friend who was watching me playing a videogame in my room, while playing music on my stereo. I don't know how much time passed around then - it feels like a lot, but at the same time, I can't remember enough events around there to justify it being a lot - that's a common theme, asking my internal clock about what time it was, and my internal clock responding three different answers at the same time depending on how it figured it - one was way slow, one was dead on, and one was way fast, although I had no trust that any one of them was correct. 
193	At that point, I'd classify my baseline as ++. I was getting used to my thoughts shooting off, etc. I still held myself fairly grounded, though. It was then that I determined that I wanted to try to let that go a little. Basically, I lay down on my couch, stared at the ceiling, and through a process very similar to trying to get to sleep while being a bit curious about what happened while you go to sleep, I let myself drift off into a deeper trip. This was the peak of my visuals, and while I let it, it certainly felt like a +++ (although was still a ++ since I could easily come out of it). The walls started to melt around, distort into absolutely intangible shapes, all while my mind did things I can no longer comprehend... what a cool experience.
194	Part of that, was one of the coolest things I've ever experienced - I saw the double helix of DNA in the sky, much, I imagine, like Francis Crick did so many years prior. Feeling a thought begin to form, I asked my friend to play Longview by Green Day - with a bassline conceived from an acid trip. It fit exactly well. I realized just how similar all of our thought processes were, and really felt connected to everyone else in the world.
195	Anyway, I guess at that point it was a bit before, or actually more likely, a bit after 4:00. We decided to go out into the woods again, this time with a different assortment of people, and the tiny bit of weed that we had between us. The goal was for two of my friends to study for a math test coming up, while getting high, and I was coming along for the walk. We went to a lesser-known spot in the woods. My original plan was to not smoke with them - I wanted to experience as pure an LSD experience as possible.
196	They talked a bit about math, and I thought a bit about other things - well, at the rate I was going, everything all at once. Here I'll explain what my 'LSD mode' is - it's what really made me realize how much of a stimulant LSD really is. My thoughts would start somewhere, then, instead of just going linearly from one thought to the next, they seemed to bounce, for some reason I want to describe it as back and forth always moving up, always moving towards more abstract thoughts and concepts, always towards the same sorts of satisfying conclusions (one of which was the idea of the logarithms - that many concepts we had that are rated on some scale are really logarithmic, not linear, and that everyone has a different 'zero point' - a different spot on that scale. I can pin that idea on the video I had watched earlier). The disturbing part about the thoughts were that they continued faster than I could have them - I felt like I totally understood each point they were bouncing off of, but at the same time, if I tried to actually conceptuallize any one of those points into communicable or even just 'normal' thought, it took far too long, and I missed a few of the points ahead. I was able to, with intense concentration, commit a few of these steps in a single thought to short-term memory, and after a while, to talk about them to my increasingly high friends. They couldn't fathom how I was thinking, so they thought it pretty funny. I did too.
197	I'd like to mention a few of the more poignant thoughts I had at that point. First off, I should note that this really felt like another peak of my trip, and it was just like my previous auditory and visual trips, although this one was in another sense. I thoroughly believed that there were, for sake of argument, 4 senses - visual, auditory, tactile and the last one, which I'll call chronospacial. The other two 'normal' senses, smell and taste, were part of chronospacial and tactile, respectively (although there was certainly some overlap). I believed (and it would come mostly true) that I would experience 4 seperate major trip events, like the previous two, and that this was the chronospacial turn. Basically, it messed with time, space, and primarily thought - the things involved with this sense that I had come up with. At this point, I was sort of bouncing fairly quickly between this strong +++ trip and my baseline. After that thought came through (well, I was chronospacially tripping, so order really wasn't important to me. It may have been before, I'll talk like I knew any sort of order, but it may not be right), I really started to feel the LSD jitters - I got a very funny feeling in my legs like I had been all day and on a previous trip on LSA, like they had just about fallen asleep, and the bloodflow was returning; I also physically was jittery at that point - my jaw particularly was vibrating pretty violently. I had heard that weed was good for this, and I decided to try it. The others had already smoked a bit, but they were more than willing to pack another - in this case, since we were pretty much out of everything else, a kief pack of my friend's pipe. He had to leave at that point, for either work or class, leaving just three of us on that little hill in the woods. It certainly helped calm the jitters quickly, and sprung my trip back up.
198	Earlier in the year, one of our good friends had taken a leave of absence from school, and wasn't going to be back until at least the next year. We really missed him. For today, in wishing me a happy birthday, he mentioned to 'smoke a bowl for him.' The type of request that I would usually think about, but never to the degree that I did right there. In smoking that bowl, I was brought right back, almost completely right back into the experience of one lazy saturday morning wake-and-bake with him and one other friend on that same little hill - at that point I was on a t-break, but I still managed, with little effort, into coaxing them accidentally into smoking far more than they were expecting to - 5 big bowls from a BIG bong. I remembered all the details of the experience - although my visual, auditory, and tactile senses were still back there in reality, my chronospacial sense was right back in that old experience. That was absolutely amazing, and truly a great sense of smoking a bowl for someone. I had never missed him more, and I felt great in a reminiscing sort of way.
199	One more thought I had that I shared with everyone else was about our perception of reality. After a recent salvia trip, I had realized suddenly the difference between perception and reality, and a big part of my current theory on what reality truly was, and how we'd never even be able to come close to comprehending everything in reality, and that the 'reality' we're in - this universe, etc. was just part of our perception of actual reality. Anyway, I wasn't talking about this idea - we'd already talked about this some time prior. First, I had a funny thought about how we'll never really be able to replay experiences ever again. We can remember quite a bit about them, but we can't go back and relive the whole experience - we can't be there again. I thought about the salvia trip I had, and how, although I can imagine what I saw, I can't see it again, and furthermore, how I'd be able to recall the experience at that point, but I'd never be able to have the experience, to feel the same way, to think the same way, etc. After that, I talked to my friends about a funny idea, almost fear that I sometimes had, that I was living life like the main character in A Beautiful Mind - basically, that my friends were all in my head, complete schizophrenic hallucinations. It was thought-provoking, and to satisfy myself, I came back to a conclusion I got during the perception vs. reality discussion from the salvia trip - that it didn't matter, that all we all had was the approximation of reality we see in our perception, so it didn't matter what was real, as long as the perception we lived in was the best we wanted it to be.
200	I can't recall whether it was the cause or the result of that discussion, but at one point, we seemed to have an entire discussion about some topic, none of us actually using real words for a while, seemingly in each other's heads. It wasn't just me - the other two agreed with me that that had happened successfully. It was odd that it mimicked the way I was thinking so well (in progressing thoughts with and without understanding any of them, at the same time).
201	Another big theme I felt there (again, all this is totally out of order, but order doesn't really matter when you're brain is in that state), was almost like deja vu. While I was sitting there, looking down, I could see my legs and arms, and I was aware of the sunglasses I had on my face (I was wearing them all day, I liked them, and they came up a couple of times), and it felt... right. It all felt familiar, I guess it felt like it had all come to this point, this was the greatest point ever. I kept thinking about the word 'LSD' at that point, and just seeing how well it fit. It agreed with the shape of my face, the shape of my glasses, the clothes I was wearing, the color of everything, it all felt so familiar as what I can only describe as perfectly satisfying. I hope that made some sense, because it made perfect sense at the time. Also, I felt a totally positive self-image. I had lost about 50lbs from that point last year, I felt healthier than ever, I had only started smoking, and truly expanding my mind in that year, and I really only gained friends, these friends within that year. I absolutely loved every part of me at that moment, and I even appreciated greatly that I appreciated myself so greatly.
202	Anyway, after some time of that, it was probably after 5 at that point, we decided to walk over to an eatery at the other side of campus, and we'd meet up with another friend there, since she was just finishing up class. The walk there was quite intense, since I was still strongly chronospacially tripping. A common thing that would happen would be for me to continue walking, with no idea how I was doing it, since it felt like my head and my thoughts were just sort of floating around. Random things in my peripheral vision, including the ground, stopped existing in my view of the world, my arms felt weird, time felt weird, etc. Again with that three different answers for time deal, I honestly thought it took an hour to walk there, I knew it was only about 10-15 minutes, and part of me wanted to believe that it was basically instant. Walking around people once we got out of the woods was interesting - it was the same experience with them as it had been earlier, only to a greater degree, and also I had no idea where I was, every knowledge of where I was, and my periphery was going in and out of existence. For parts, I felt like I could, not see, but know the entire path of where we were going and coming from, all at once, and other times, I was just floating thoughts again. At one point, while we were walking past a few buildings, I had entirely believed that we were one path to the right of where we were - it's not that I was visually tripping, but I had entirely interpreted what I had seen completely wrong. That's where I learned a lot about how our other senses relate to the chronospatial, looking back.
203	We eventually made it. I wasn't hungry (I wasn't expecting to be), although I did need a drink. This was going to be a challenge. This facility was a few different types of food all in one, with different cashiers and lines for food. I'd been there maybe twice before, but this time was really a challenge - I have always had social anxiety related to not knowing how to do certain social processes, and I realized, after wandering around for a tiny bit like an idiot, that I had no idea what to do. I ended up waiting in the Mexican food line with my friends, although I didn't want any food. When the lady asked me what I wanted, I told her that I just wanted a drink, and she said that I didn't have to wait in line, that I could go right ahead to the register. I still had no idea how to do this without cutting a line, so I told her it was alright, and only looked like a bit of an idiot. The most important part was that I not look like a tripping idiot, and I think I pulled that off. Anyway, I bought the large drink cup finally, and went over, wanting unsweetened iced tea. I filled an entire large cup with sweetened before figuring out how to get unsweetened - in retrospect I should've asked one of my friends to help me with that. It was alright, the artificial sweetener was bad, especially in that quantity, but it was liquid, and that helped.
204	We sat outside, in some of the most comfortably proportioned wooden chairs that have ever existed, and talked about the day, about how done we were with school, etc. There were a lot of people around (it was the start of the dinner rush), and they were all talking about the same things. I spent most of the time half listening, half letting my thoughts bounce around - to the outside, it looked like I was totally spacing out half the time. That period of time lasted for a while, that friend we were meeting met us there, and as it approached what I guess was 6:00, my other friend left to go to that math test. Around then, we realized that the sun was going to set pretty soon, and that we should totally go somewhere to enjoy it fully. We eventually decided on the hill not far from us that was the tallest hill in the county, and where the city's radio towers were. After another seemingly both forever and instant walk back to dormside, we got ready to go. At this point, that was sort of my last big peak, and was on the comedown from there.
205	5 or 6 of us packed into my car, and I took shotgun and let one of my friends drive. It's a somewhat powerful (above average, at least) car, and while we were on our way, at one point, I told my friend to gun it in second - and was immediately brought back to the first test drive, the first time I got to experience just how fun that car could be, sitting shotgun because I couldn't even drive stick back then. I also remembered a bit of woods on the north side of campus that I wanted to smoke in at some point that day, and made a mental note of that. We made it to the hill, which I thought was fairly cool. I had wanted to make it up there anyway, because I had always been a bit of a radio geek, and tower farms have always interested me. I really enjoyed walking up the hill, and thought about both the time the last year, my senior year of high school, on our senior trip to the Poconos, and how strikingly similar an experience it was - this sort of end-of-year experience that wasn't all the way at the end of the year, etc. I also thought about how I had never truly appreciated hikes like this with my family. We looked out on the landscape, which was beautiful, but it was hard for me to put into place exactly where everything I was looking at was. It was interesting seeing how still most of the landscape was, and then seeing the highway around the city, and all the streets, totally full of motion, like little ants scurrying around. I thought about what it's like to be in one of those cars, and what it's like to look out and see the whole picture (again, like the logarithms from before). I thought about the fact that I could see this tower farm from my window in my dorm, and tried to find campus, but couldn't figure exactly where it was. We took a look at the sunset, but couldn't get a great view, since it wasn't on the right side of the hill to get a good overlook. My friend who drove did take the opportunity to take some great pictures with the light shining through the woods, and got what is still one of my favorite pictures of me (fortunately, I can show it to people, because you really can't tell what I was on). We chilled up there until the sun went down a bit, and then headed back (the mosquitos weren't as strong as they'd be in a few weeks, but there were some bothering us). We drove back, this time I sat in the back, and I thought about how satisfying it was that the sunset wasn't a satisfying cutoff, I thought about what it was like being in the back of my parent's car as a kid, not knowing the way (although I did have to give directions a few times), and so on.
206	We made it back, at which point it was late enough that pretty much everyone was out of class. We all headed to my room, since it was the most comfy for holding a lot of people (with the couch and all). Everyone talked about the day, again about how they were done or almost done with school for the year, etc. Just good solid, happy conversation. Also, at one point, I got just a tiny bit of a tactile trip - I started feeling the texture of my pants, the shape of my sunglasses, and so on, and feeling absolutely wonderful for every bit of it. A few of our less close friends showed up to and chilled with us for a bit, there was a little bit of beer left (I didn't take any), etc. There were talks to try to acquire more weed, but that wasn't going so well at that point. After a while, pretty much everyone wanted to play kanjam out on campus somewhere - I didn't want to join because the plan was to also drink and smoke while doing that - I didn't want to risk getting caught like that, so I stayed back for a bit.
207	It didn't take long to get antsy, I packed myself up my bong and everything I needed to go along with it (at this point I'm maybe feeling +, but convincing myself I was totally sober, although I had the biggest urge in the world to smoke). Since we as a group were basically eniterly out of weed, I had to borrow some from someone else - it's great that everyone on my floor is super friendly, and I'm totally willing to smoke him out later, I just REALLY NEEDED to smoke at that point. It's hard to explain that urge. I'm on my way out, and I run into my friend who had been at her sorority thing of some sort all night thusfar (I hadn't seen her since the first time I went outside), and she happily agrees to go with me to the woods. We head to that spot on the north side that I had made a note to smoke at earlier, I talk about my experience up to now, she talks about her day with the sorority thing, etc. I smoked most of a pack of that bong by myself, as she was still new to the weed game.
208	The first really bad thing to happen all day was when we were almost done (oh yeah, and smoking was really bringing my trip back up), and we hear some people going around the woods - I bag up the bong (although it's totally set up still), and try to figure out what's going on - nobody ever came out to the part of the woods we were in, so we both sort of assumed it was public safety looking for us. A bit of freaking out later, and it's just some people starting a fire a little further away. We finish up, then get word that the other group was in the woods on the other side of campus. Cool, we'll meet up, hang out, it sounds great.
209	We leave the woods, and I make sure to stop for a second to look up at the stars - I had wanted to lie down, but the grass was very wet. It was a very clear day, and you could see tons of stars. Two things happened to me during that.  At one point, I totally heard a rave that didn't exist going on around there, and sort of had the experience in my head to some degree - definitely auditory hallucinations, and a bit on that chronospatial, but not too much. Also, for the first time I totally understood constellations. I had always been able to pick out the shapes and such, but this time, I was actually able to see the horses, the people up there, superimposed over the stars. That was pretty cool.
210	We continued on our way, and made it to the woods, although we weren't yet at our destination. As we were finally approaching the spot, we, and everyone already at the spot, saw a flashlight, followed be somebody in a deep voice yelling 'Hey, there's kids in there!' The way they were talking, it was as though it was the cops, trying to give us a chance to get the hell out of there, because they were looking. I wouldn't have freaked out, since everything I had on me was away, and I felt confident in my ability to refuse a search and whatnot, except that I entirely believed they had drug dogs with them. I panicked pretty badly, along with everyone else, and was trying to decide whether to ditch my stuff or not - I believed the most rational thing to do was to run. I tried to make it to another path that eventually led across a stream and back to dorm side, but I missed the entrance to that (nighttime in the woods is just about the worst situation for trying to get any input from your senses - which led to it being terrifying in both instances), and ended up cornering myself basically in the swamp. All along, I was thinking, if I didn't have all that stuff on me, I was going to check out the situation, see if it actually was the cops, and maybe end the panic altogether. I was really hoping that someone would do that, and not long after thinking that, it sounded like someone was doing that, although I had entirely believed that, from the sounds of it, it actually was the cops, and that there was no way out of it for me. I should also mention that, since I had already been caught earlier in the year, if I got caught again, I was basically out of school, which basically meant I was afraid for my life. Just a little more of that panic, before it all came out that the 'cops' were some drunk third-years who were playing a bit of a prank while they were looking for one of thier friends who had made his way through the woods somewhere. I was not the only one to thank them for the experience - now that we knew it was totally safe, I realized that I had not been that absolutely terrified in a long time, and in retrospect, it was thrilling. I honestly believed that I was not safe, and that doesn't come up often.
211	We made our way back to the dorms - I can't recall if we went out again after that, so I'll say we didn't. We all talked over what had happened for a bit, and then, because it was still a weekday, slowly started going off to bed. At that point it was around midnight, and I myself made it into bed.
212	The next day, I was mentally exhausted, did hardly anything, and still went to sleep early. Both that day and the day after, when I smoked, I was brought back very slightly into my trip, although even at its strongest, it was barely a ++. I have not experienced any other flashbacks since.

215	I'm 15 an I live in manchester,england and I had a fucking weired experience on holiday in majorca.I was out on the beach one morning when a guy came up 2 me and asked if I wanted sum 'stuff' he then whiped out a bag of skunk and some blotters,I was aprehensive about the acid as I had never tried it before but I decided to buy a couple of trips and some skunk.Later at the hotel I met up with a friend and had a couple of joints out of the window.I then took a tab in the lift.When I got off I saw a hypnotist in the bar asking for volenteers,so naturaly I got up there.He told me I was going to give up smoking, so he sat me down and he told me to  close my eyes and let my mind drift,which was easy as I was stoned and hallucinating slightly!!! I then found my self in the most relaxed 'floaty' mood I have ever experienced in my life.The colours were drifting round my face,I wasnt sure if I was in a trance or tripping.Next thing I remember was waking up in my room 6 hours later totally awake and alert. I was told the next day that the hypnotist couldnt wake me and a doctor had been called!I have recently tried to recreate this experience with no effects near the ones I experienced before.

217	My name is Casey, I go to college in Oklahoma. All the years of highschool I had wanted to trip but in our little town, acid is unheard of. I finally got the chance last Feb. 13. Lucky thirteen!
218	The day before the trip I get a phonecall from my friend Slim, he informs me that he found some acid (obviously knowing I would be interested). I was excited. I told him I wanted to drop early in the morning, so I could see the sunrise. Which was supposed to be the cool 'trip' thing to do, according to my friends. 
219	I arrived at his house about 5am, he was already up and ready to drop (this was his first too). He presents a piece of wrinkled tin foil about the size of a playing card, he unfolded, and inside I counted six little scooby doo heads. I couldn't wait!!!
220	We decided to split it up down the middle and go for broke. We drop our hits at the same time and stare at each other, for a moment before laughing at each other. We were nervous and very excited at the same time.
221	About 5:30, the sunlight is starting to show a little. I feel nothing, slim says he is starting to feel it. He said he felt like he was in a rollercoaster. This was the last thing I remember him saying for quite awhile, because at that instant the sun peaked up over the hills, and my trip began explosively. The sun came up, and it was the most glorious thing I have ever seen, I heard the william tell overture throughout the suns magnificent arrival to our day. The sun radiated off waves of light in synch with every symbol crash of the symphony going on in my brain. This lasts what seemed like hours but being perfectly content with it, I didn't mind. 
222	Im interrupted by Slim saying something about the sun winking at him. I stare at him for a second, and begin laughing hysterically. We both fall on the floor laughing and talking about what we saw during the sun's appearance, acting like a couple jocks winning the championship. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen in my life. I was in love with LSD. I have since tripped maybe 500 times, I have never had a bad trip. I have never felt better in my life.

225	At the time of my experience I had been experimenting with hard drugs for about one month but so far had only taken ecstasy and cocaine. On this night me and a few of my friends had planned to buy some mdma and have a fucked uo night. The person who supplied the mdma did not have the ammount that we requested however but we bought what he had which was 0.6 grams. I dropped 0.2 grams of the mdma and thoroughly enjoyed myself for a few hours.
226	My friend, who had taken lsd before, informed me that he could get some if I wanted to do it. We headed off to get the acid and once we got it I dropped a tab.
227	Once we had returned to my friends house I began to trip pictures and people in the room swirling in mad patterns this was amazing.   For me, LSD the affects can last for hours and eventually after destroying pumpkins, laying against a wall, eating mass amounts of sweets and pulling endless toots the acid began to get very boring and eventually I wish it away.
228	Soon after this me and my friends decided to try and sleep I remember trying to watch the film the devil's rejects but becoming confused every few seconds as to what was a trip and what wasn't. I layed down and tried to sleep and all that I can remember where two red lights dashing around the ceiling and seeing a young girl running towards me with a hand full of flowers. There was nothing but white and she began to hit me with the flowers. I then awoke and in a very confused state sat up and questioned my friend as to  'what the fuck we did the night before. His answer was one that I will never forget 'I don't know but for some reason I'm wearing a bra.'

231	I wanted to experience whatever LSD gives you, and this may have been the only chance I have to do it in a very long time, so I decided to drop two tabs. Apparently these tabs were Pure L and 250 ug each. I got a little nervous after having heard that, but I didn't panic. I did it with two friends, and my girlfriend. One of the friends, along with my girlfriend, dropped one tab, where I dropped two and our more experienced friend dropped three, (fuckkng 750 ug)
232	So at first I didn't know what to expect, and then euphoria came. Everything was funny, and I mean everything. We just looked at dumb memes on this huge tv that was in the room and laughed our asses off for about two hours, and then shit got weird. At some point someone turned on dark side of the moon, and I was laying in bed watching the ceiling melt. My girlfriend is an artist, so she had s bunch of her pieces hug up around her room. They looked so Trippy, especially the self portraits, I thought the paper was melting off the wall. At one point my experience friend said he was seeing waves so my new friend starts explaining longitudinal and transverse waves to him, asking what he was seeing, and eventually he comes to the conclusion that he was seeing surface waves. There is a napkin with waves drawn all over it, along with the words help, night vale, and the number 17. We started watching these videos, these Trippy as fuck videos like double King, fever the ghost (source) and elephant garden. I thought they were super cool, my new friend got freaked out by them. In one of the videos there's a pair of dancing shadow guys with masks. And I swear to God I was seeing them in the corner of my eyes all day. This was the best part of the trip to me, nothing was really making sense and all that we were doing was laying on the bed or looking into mirrors. The house is actually an apartment, with two floors. We agreed to stay in her room for the peak, but I really really wanted to go outside for like 10 seconds to look at the sky, unfortunately it was a gray and cloudy cold as fuck day, so there wasn't really anything to see.
233	About two hours after that we all eventually came to a consensus that we wanted to go walk to the park, something that was about a 15 minute walk away. My girlfriend kept trying to say stuff like 'oh it's gone now' 'I'm not high anymore' but then I would ask 'is the sky still moving' and she would accept that she was still tripping balls. We got to the park, no body was there. My experienced friend and I were just playing this this musical xylophone thing built into the play ground. Every now and then I would hear the song from that video, and I would see the little mask guys dancing in the shadows somewhere, at first it scared me but then I realized they're nice and I started to like it. This is when my girlfriend and my new friend started to have a bad trip. They both got filled with anxiety and were super nervous for no real reason, they kept saying that someone is gonna catch us, something bad is gonna happen, even though we were just some teens at a park. I calmed them down a bit and made them start enjoying it again, but then my new friend started to black out.
234	We immediately went back to my girlfriends place, making sure that the new friend did not fall or pass out. As we were walking me and the experienced guy started talking about some super weird shit, and now there is s video of me walking down the street sayin 'wub wub, wub wub wub' as a sentence and then getting a response of wubs from my friend back. At one point I said 'one wub unto the many' and we thought it was the deepest shit ever. Anyway eventually we got back to the room and chilled there. My new friend curled up in a ball in a chair and started talking about how much he misses his girlfriend, so we gave him a stuffed animal and named it his girlfriends name, which calmed him down a bit.
235	We went back to the park a few times, nothing too weird happened, colors changing and shit being weird, the usual. Then it was 10:30 pm, when we had to go home. We had already agreed not to drive, and we left the car back at my place and took the bus to my girls in the morning, but now we had To go back. The bus we took earlier was not running any more. It was 40 degrees Fahrenheit outside. It was raining. I was on acid. So we start our journey to the train, cold and wet at balls. We get to the train station and my experienced friend says 'gotta take a piss Brb' so he jumps the train tracks to god knows where to go piss. He gets back like 30 seconds before the train gets there, that made me nervous. We take the train to a transit center, then wait for THIRTY MINUTES at MIDNIGHT, TWENTY FEET FROM COPS, while its raining and cold. Some homeless people try to finagle us out of our money, but they give up eventually. That was the longest thirty minutes of my life. Eventually we get on the correct bus and get back to my house, where it took me like an hour to fall asleep.
236	So, I didn't have an epiphanies, nothing really deep realized about myself, it was just a fun time. My girlfriend didn't have the best Time, but she was nervous because we were at her house, she she's willing to try again. My new friend doesn't want to do it ever again, he just wants to stick with weed. My girlfriend realized she's too uptight about stuff and my friend realized he's An anxious piece of shit, and I just had fun. Hopefully that's not a bad thing for dropping 500 ug after never drinking smoking or doing any drug ever before.

239	It was about 10:30 when my friend gave a me 3 tabs of the acid(1 for me and the other 2 weere my friends)my friend took a corner of hers right away to try it out...3 periods after I decided to try it out so I took about half of it at like 12:30 and kept it under my tongue for 30 minutes and about 40 minutes later after I took it, it started to kick in. I felt really happy and giggly, my entire body felt like it was tingling  and the. Last period came so i took the rest of the tab and so I was in Spanish just watching home alone laughing.there was 20 minutes left till school ended and I got called up to the assistant principles room.
240	Once I got there he said I heard some rumors about u and some kids trying acid...I said no and the nurse came up to look at pupils...that's when it really kicked in and her face looked like it was melting..they let the buses leave and they started checking my pockets and back pack bc my pupils where the size of the fuckin moon. I ended up getting detention bc j had a vape in my pocket. They grabbed my pockets and totally missed the acid so that was good but then all three of the assistant principles were in the room asking me what I took...I said nothing and they brought me to my asistwnt princluples office where they called my dad...the carpet was beutiful and and patterns and colors everywhere where amazing. He had me sit in a conference room until my parents came to pick me up. I sat there just amazed staring at this chair stretch and shrink, move closer and farther and there was this window with this huge tree that just looked amazing. The whole room was turning green and red and orange and there were flowers all offer the floor and I look at myself in a glass window and my hair was like floating up and glowing. Supriseingly I wasn't scared or anxious at alm throughout this and when my mom heard I was on acid she told them my eyes where big because I took an adderall that day so they would let me go home.
241	I got home and just took a shower after I had this convo with my mom...she didn't care too much that I was on acid bc I had good grade in school and am mostly mature (she might have thought that I had only ate a pot brownie) The shower was amazing and there were patterns all over the tiles and my dad was playing the drums downstairs and so that was cool. After I got out of the shower I walked out of the bathroom to find my sister, her friend, my mom, and my moms friend talking them not even knowing I'm on acid tripping hard. I danced around my room for a little bit and had so many thoughts flowing thinking about life. 
242	Later that night at like 7 my friend who also took that day came over and his face at like tribal symbols over his face and we just talked about the next day and what we were seeing...I ended up falling asleep looking at the closed-eye visuals which looked like this rainbow of intense colors my eyes have never seen before.

261	I began to feel the effects an hour after ingestion of a liquid hit dropped on a sugar cube. At first I saw mild distortions of shapes and objects began to look funny. Shortly after I had stopped writing in my journal because I believed it would be better to fully enjoy the experience and forget about logging the details.
262	My senses were mixing with everything around me. I tasted lights. I felt as if everything around me was a flowing texture of sensory data and emotion. I felt heavenly. Everything felt right. I felt like I was doing the right things with my life, and that I was treating people the way they should be treated. I could not understand at the time how someone might have a bad trip on this stuff.
263	I had visual hallucinations but the emotional charge on objects around me was what moved me the most. I had visual hallucinations but the emotional charge on objects around me was what moved me the most. I ignored most aspects of the visual hallucinations and focused on what intrigued me the most. It felt extremely spiritual.
264	This was a very profound experience, but I was in a safe setting and it lasted 12 hours.
265	The next day, I felt charged. I feel like quitting drinking, and I feel motivated and goal-oriented. I feel 'fixed'. I am confident. I do not regret it the least bit.

268	The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
269	I have taken LSD several times, usually between 2 and 4 'hits'.  With this particular batch, I felt the hits were fairly potent.  I decided to take 9 in my dorm room.  (5 days ago, I had taken 4 hits, so I probably had a light tolerance built up)
270	The experience was similar to a 4-hit trip, except the visual hallucinations were more vivid, perhaps more synthetic(?)  Far more interesting for me was the audio.  I had not noticed it until a good 5 hours or so into the trip.  I heard a faint creaking in my mind, sort of like rapid pulses of sound like a modem noise over the telephone.  I found that as I concentrated on this noise, playing it up in my mind, it grew louder.  I could hear distortions of this sort of 'data stream' noise analogous to the settings in an audio program such as Pro Tools or Sound Forge (modulation, frequency, wow-flutter).  Very bizarre and very cool.
271	Up until this point, I had doubted the notion that LSD could produce auditory hallucinations greater than the sort of 'whirr' that accompanies most serotogenic trips of mine.  Here, the LSD seemed to generate its own stream of sound, independent from all sounds in the room. Here, the LSD seemed to generate its own stream of sound, independent from all sounds in the room.  I tend to view LSD as the most natural-feeling of the 'synthetic' hallucinogens - however, the sounds I heard reminded me more of the synthetic character of, say, 2ci.
272	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
273	I first took the hit in front of the mirror. I went out of the bathroom and held it under my tongue for about 30 minutes then swallowed. I started looking up at the ceiling and saw bugs gathering around the ceiling fan. The patterns on the ceiling looked really intricate like a top-notch old western painting. I knew it was just the Christmas lights reflecting off of the tree. I took LSD for my first and last time that day. It was Christmas break and everybody else took more hits than me so it was like they were in a different world. I wanted to be alone so I went out to my car and when everybody else got in I thought they were trying to set me up. I knew that they were my friends but I just wanted to trip by myself, as I though that was the best way to trip so that I didn't have any distractions.
274	While I was in my car I stayed up the whole night from 11pm to 12am and went to work while I was coming down. I made pizza and that was the easiest job to trip while I am working. During that time in my car I lost half of my ego. I thought that I turned into somebody else and I had to tell all of my friends that I wasn't really human. I believe that is the true feeling of dying. I turned into something else other than an earthly body. My soul carries on. People may think that the reasoning behind LSD is to seduce people. But the true good trips are those that make one loose their ego and bring one back down to reality. Reality is just an finite spec in time.

277	' we were waiting for it to kick in, and by the end of the night we were like,' oh thats just a space ship. Thats all.'
278	We took our drugs around 10, as soon as they kicked in we became wrapped into the movie we were watching, it was snowing in my room, the cold air of the atmosphere, steamed on our skin, like pouring cold water on a hot frying pan.. The room was breathing, walls were bending, we could tell there was a war or something like it going on outside from all the flashing lights and shaking of the room.. I had to pee all the sudden, so I got up to go to the bathroom, the journey 4 feet seemed like a walk across the desert, once inside the bathroom, I could see that my reflection was not me, I thought, who am I, is this what I look like, and why is my face dripping, I'm not sure if I ever even got a chance pee because I became intranced by the character that supposely was my reflection.. I remember thinking to myself, this is my reality, and if yours is anywhere close to mine, then your fucked...

281	It was A gloomy October 31st...yes it was all hallows eve. Me and my friend who will be called J set out on A journey. Our minds clear and deep we purchased some acid. Everything started at 5:00 Pm darkness had just sat in, we are in my apartment we comsume the blotter pieces at 5:30. 45 minuites later my body felt light and I sat up to shake it off. After this time had passed I felt like I have never taken a drug before. My friend J was also feeling the same effects. We decided to go out and walk the town as soon as I set foot outside I suddenly became strangely inebriated. The external world became changed as in a dream. Objects appeared to gain inrelief; they assumed unusual dimensions; and colors became more glowing. Even self-perception and the sense of time were changed. When the eyes were closed, colored pictures flashed past in a quickly changing kaleidoscope. After a few hours, the not unpleasant inebriation, which had been experienced whilst I was fully conscious, disappeared. I came back to reality for a moment and relized there were two cops talking to me saying son what have you injested? I said Lsd; I thought to myslef he cant do anything he cant prove anything so I told my story. He took my firend and I back to our apartment and we walked in and sat and let the Lsd dive into our minds.

284	I took the hits around 7 p.m. on a perfect spring day.  About 20-25 of us were hanging out in a field waiting for it to kick in.  After 30 minutes, I started to get an ongoing rush in my chest, and I went across the field to my friends house and jumped on his trampoline for awhile.
285	Once I got off the trampoline, I started to feel pretty weird.  I met up with my dealer so I could buy another hit for later.  Me, him, and one other person took off on bikes.  My dealer stopped and looked at me and when he turned around he looked very wavy and he told me to give him the money.  For a second I thought he was robbing me, but of course, he was just going to get the stuff.
286	Me and the other kid sat on the curb waiting for him.  While I waited I looked down at the curb next to me and one of the stones there turned into an ant, and then another did, and another, until the ants were crawling all over me.  I started brushing them off and eventually they soaked back into the cement.
287	On the way back to the rest of the people, we took the train tracks.  As I walked along, I started to hear the increasingly obnoxious crunching of my feet on the coal, only when I looked down, I saw piles of brightly colored glass.  I didn't want to get a flat tire, so I picked up my bike.  We got to the end of the tracks and we had to climb down a small hill.  I got to the edge and slipped.  I started to slide down on the glass, but once I reached the end, I was fine,  I never even fell.
288	Eventually we made our way to another friends house, and after a little while, everybody showed up.  We put in The Wall, and fell into a deep couch.  As soon as the first note was played, I got burst of air in my face.  I leaned over towards my friend and it seemed like the wall of the living room followed me, and I could now see through it.  Another kid walked in, who wasnt tripping, and he sat in the front.  The DVD player shorted out, and without saying anything about it we all yelled at the kid that just walked in.  He stood up and everybody started to make fun of him.  He was really just trying to fix the movie, but I thought he was trying to act like daffy duck and put on a comedy skit.
289	After that was over we went for a walk.  Me and three others split off from the huge group and went our old middle school.  We sat for there and just tripped face for about an hour, then we decided to go back to the house.  We came to a hill that led down to the road, but we were all afraid to go down.  I decided it would be best to get it over with and jumped in.  I quickly jumped right back out because I thought the tall grass was stabbing me all over.  We found a path down, and we walked the sidewalk back to the house, and on the way, me and my one friend dodged across the street right in front of a cop, but for some reason, he didnt say anything.
290	When we got back, we just sat around watching horror movies while we were coming down, because it turned out to be Friday the 13th.  Needless to say, that was the craziest night I experienced up to that point.

292	So I had just dropped 2 hits of acid questioning the real strength of this drug and oh boy was I wrong about it
293	Dosed at midnight, by 1 oclock I was playing halo 2 on my xbox 360 when I got this sudden burst of energy and then I look around the basement and I see all these colors pertruding out of the ceiling tiles. Just to let you know this waas my first time and I was in my basement without any1 to watch me. So then I hurd my dad coming down the stairs so then I ran to my bedroom which was dark and hid uner the covers and closed my eyes. Then I get very sweaty and panicky and started hearing these loud sounds as if my dad came down and through evreything to the ground, and then I questioned reality thinking mayb I was throwing evreything to the ground and I just wasnt seeing it kind of like an out of body expierence, and this terrified the hell out of me so then I opened my eyes and looked around my basement and saw evreything was normal and that ended the peak of my trip
294	The next couple of hours sucked the worst, I couldnt go to sleep, tremors, loss of appetite and my body tempature went up about 10 degrees and this lasted for the next 16 hours 
295	I am lucky my trip wasnt worse and the come down of lsd is sucks and I needed about 3 days to recover from it

298	It was friday night and me and my buddies had planned to do acid for the past week. My buddy Shaun supplied the blotter tabs. I had bought four and was only planning on taking two (since this was my first time), but my friends forced me to take them all at once, so I did. It seemed like forever waiting for the acid to start working (45-60 min). When I started to get high I felt like my legs were soaking in a hottub, it was very relaxing. After about 10 min I started to feel the stronger effects, I couldn't stop laughing, even when I thought about hurtfull, depressing events that happened in my life all I could do was laugh about them. 15 minutes later I was still laughing, but I started to see stuff now. The walls of buildings would seem to sway and buckle, trees would seem to sway but there was no wind.I could hear a disturbance all around me (almost like static). I wandered around town like this for a while. There were times when I felt scared, like I was loseing my mind a very overwhelming feeling. I had to find cover so I went to the teen center. I stayed there and tried to watch T.V. In the back room but I couldnt pay attention so I turned it off. The tv then began to almost split apart but not quite,like it was trying to split apart. I then noticed the floor was doing the same thing. I left the teen center and wandered some more. I had lost my friends so I had no direction. I was so obcest with perfection that I lit my swetter on fire outside the fire station cause I had found some dirt on it.I then went home and layed in bed all night trying to sleep. I look forward to acid again.

300	LSD (2) : General (1), First Times (2), Various (28)
301	Last year in September I took some acid. I was 22 years old and a skinny guy. I purchased some 3 x small card board tabs
302	Unsure of print or  Pattern. Me and a group of friend's were attending a music festival, I took my 3 tabs about 30-40 minutes from the festival at about 11.30am. I also should say I am a fairly experienced user of LSD with this not being my first trip.
303	I started to feel the effects as we walked threw the gates and past the boys in blue. It really did hit me hard, I walked with my friends and my one mate who I had tripped with before guide me into the festival, I remember a lot of things going ' klaidescope ' of whatever the spelling. It was really intense, everything was wobbly, and morphing like good acid should be, for a good 2 or so hours we walked around, meeting new people gathering supply's and just exploring, in that time I was just a mess, I don't remember much in that time. I don't remember much in that time. 
304	We came to the blue stage where some friends went one way some the other so me and a couple of people decided to sit around and wait. I remember sitting there talking to friends and constantly touching the grass,  at this part I remember two things:
305	1) there was a photo frame set up for people to stand in and it had the stage in the back ground, there was two girls dressed up, I would call them fairy girls,  I asked them to take my picture, one girl replied  'do you have a phone' I didn't really know what I was thinking I just wanted my picture taken and had this thought about me being in a picture in a picture. Lol. I salute the fairy's and sit back with my friends. 
306	2) Was my trip guiding friend saying something to me, I can't remember what it was but it cracked me up, so much I was in hysterics, I couldn't stop laughing for a good five or so minutes, the proper giggles it was good, what ever my spirit leader said did what he attended it to do. Good fellow 
307	From there we went and got food, I purchase two sausages rolls and tried to eat them both at same time whilst laughing with myself following my group around, another half hour passes and I come to a point I realise everyone else is dancing and I'm trying to eat sausage rolls. So I THROW my rolls down and dance in victory over those delicious pastry's.
308	Some time past partying and killing time we came to another stage sitting on the grass, at this point I fairly sore and was laying up and down looking at the clouds and feeling the grass, the clouds were making  triangle patterns into each other. Also there was another moment where I sat up having a cigarette with my eyes closed hallucinating the warmth of the sun made me feel like a golden orb of some sort. The moment past we danced some more seen more people walked around did plenty of things. My trip started to settle a bit and when we were standing at the back of the stage I could see the clouds all flare up like in a time lapse in a big circle all around the stage. It was magical. Over time my trip settled and I could have conversations more and just function normally.
309	Later in the night towards the end I dropped a cap, I was told to be MDMA, I had a mad rush of heat and threw up about 3 times I had a pretty bad experience from then feeling mainly sick. I surely did feel the M came up and was somewhat peaking on the ride home more then usual it was weird.  I got back to the hotel 12-1am that night and got warm.

312	I have taken LSD for around 10 years, smoked Cannabis for 14 years and have tried most other soft drugs. I was at my friends house, we talked about various drugs and the effects, smoked a bit of grass and watched a few videos. Just before I left to go home he said he had some old LSD tabs (about 12 months he said) he brought out the packet, it contained 10 tabs with piece signs draw in red. Goody Goody I thought, ill go home ring a couple of mates get a few vid's in and we'll have a bash. 12 month acid probably won't work anyway I thought.
313	Got home called 2 of my best mates, it was about 7pm when they arrived. Sat down smoked a bong with hash and downed a Tab with a can of Lager. 30 mins later and a couple of joints nothing was happening(LSD wasn't working) we each ate another LSD tab and smoked another bong, we waited for another 45mins 'nothing'. Must be duff acid, by this time we were pretty stoned so time was starting to be difficult to pin down. It was around 9pm and me and one of my mates ate another acid and smoked another bong, BANG it was almost as-if it was waiting for us to take that one extra. I have had some excellent trips before but this took the biscuit, my friend who had the 2 acid left the house in a hurry saying he had to go(poor guy didn't no what hit him). Thats left me and Dave to finnish the acid our selfs, it get patchy and hard to describe as I'm not great at writing, but I will try, while sitting on the sofa with TV in corner and CD going, my vision became completey detached from what I was looking at, the room was gone, although it was gone it used the same lines which I could see just different? Weird shit. 10 hours later after a bad trip with spiders and fireplaces and curtains we started to surface and get back to talking to each other.

315	Two days ago, I went to get my second Tattoo done and my first one retouched, and decided, since I don't get tattoos often, and I had a tab with me, I should eat it, and I did, and let me tell you something, NOT A GOOD IDEA, at least not from the acid side, I was so concentrated on keeping the pain away, that I didn't peak on the acid, only after the tattoos where done and I relaxed, I got the acid working, and it was After Peak, I was comming down, and I was never really up, the good part is that I was able to keep most of the pain away thanks to the acid since when I relaxed, the pain also came flaring back with a Bad attitude.
316	So... Tattoo on acid, A good idea for the pain, A bad Idea for the Acid

319	The night I did two cubes was a crazy night, the experience was absolutely amazing. I had only done one hit befor I did these two, so it was quite a leap in dosage. In the beginning of the night I was having an amazing amount of fun, riding a bmx around, jumping off stuff, times where good. After maybe 2 hours my peak began, and it was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. The hallucinations where absolutely insane, stuff like trees swaying in the non-existent wind, and clouds forming really beautiful shapes. The most odd thing that I had experienced was what I call 'cone vision' where the middle of my sight seemed closer to me than it really was, while the outer sides of my sight was farther away than it really was.
320	The whole thing was really an odd experience. Then the anxiety hit me, I cant quite remember how scared I was that night, but I know that the fright was overwhelming. I soon realized, after my trip, that the reason I got so scared was because of the place that I took the cubes in the start. It was new to me, so during the trip, everything seemed new to me, too new, and thats what scared me the most... I think atleast.

323	On a clear night, I went to someone's house I didn't know that well with a new good friend of mine from treatment. I have gobbled tons of boomers in my lifetime but I had never experienced acid.
324	I felt like I knew what to expect: maybe to get a little uneasy  because it would be very intense. But this was not so.
325	Yes, it was more intense. Things seemed to move much faster than on shrooms. I ended up having sex on acid. This was something that was not planned! I saw stars, tons of them, beautiful stars,slightly deformed stars--- and the scenery was always immaculate. I studied everything, because there was so much demention, and it didn't have any similar hallucinations to shrooms. This was an individualized drug, I must say. Completely unexpected. I remember looking at a Kurt Cobain poster. Kurt was winking, smiling and even slightly flirting with me through his stares.I laughed at lot, this drug is so beautiful, I seemed to be seeing chinese dragons in trees and such, it was SO beautiful. Everything was.
326	The next 2 days I felt a little dead/emotionless but it all comes back.

329	Me and a friend had taken many hits of LSD before this intense experience. I was very educated on the drug and had a sincere passion for its effects. We got our hands on some LSD-25 blotter papers made in Switzerland. I took 3 and a half and he took two. We layed down on the end of my dock around 6 oclock looking up at the sky waiting for the LSD to kick in and the sun to start setting. About 1 hour and a half after taking it the most ridiculous things started appearing in the clouds, we saw many faces glaring at us. The clouds moved to form a huge spiral in the sky covering the entire sky. My mind and spirit left my body. I felt like I had no control over myself or anything else around me I went wherever the doses took me. Many other things happened during my trip that by the way lasted 16 hours. LSD is fun.

332	I can hear the music harsh rattling whirr and thump - marching human automaton technology rattling the ceiling up the stairs places crazy living noise party on the upper floors of the high-rise, banners draped from the uppermost windows block the light to the top half of the building. The lift doors all open into the black shaft makes a great image in the mind falling falling through the void crack! My head catching the steel girders of the shaft in hard fast deathpain clanging silence still falling. Real blackness now that would really whack bounce right off skull cracking on that steel edge. 
333	In this corridor is an old joystick arcade machine smashed screen behind circuit boards and panels are visible - a row of glowing oblong panels shoots from behind me just past my right eye and into the distance - click click - whirrr - patterns like Mayan idols line the outer extremes of my vision, dancing - morphing with solid liquid technology of mercury and hard frictionless plastic tac - seeds dying and reborn inside patterned in spiral matrix - in the party people are decoding - parts breaking off into reams of numerical digits and light - split like bad tracking - blips inherent in my system blocked messages of violence images seem to skip and freeze randomly - eyes roll in the sockets - lesbians with space cadet jackets held down below the shoulders mooch around sporting booze and fags, rat-hair matted layers give her extra. Huge rubbish piles and abandoned hoardings rot and overlap damply in a corner - in one room sun shines brightly through a solitary exposed window white as someone touches my neck inaudible whispers coolly into my ear Im watching the fenced road scarred concrete block landscape wracked with steel and synthetic frames the planet is a concrete and steel ice crystal in all directions splaying, growing outwards - cheek touch in the shiny milk light of the room. 
334	Another room steel sounds rain down force from the ceiling big black bags around this guys eyes like coal sacks all the way to the ears cap peak coming over straight darkening mechanic. Another room dusty, dark, empty time delaying. Another room he comes down on his victim heavy with a fist I see it all blood spurting out of his nose and mouth - sledgehammer - smash the huge lump of metal crashes up through the edge of his jaw shattering tooth and bone across the room man drops death gurgling head coming apart - Get out! Run! Leave the building blood from the victim splattered on my shirt mind spinning sickening turns - get away from there! Go! Darkness spinning in from all sides.

336	Last year, when I was 16 years old when I did acid to trip for the first time, previous times I had did 25I-NBOME which I identified by its strong metallic and bitter taste. The only reason I know this was truly LSD was because I had got caught at school smoking and they searched me, they found the LSD tablets on me and gave them to the cops to be tested, I later discovered through the police department it was indeed LSD. Also to note I dont remember a whole lot from this trip so I apologize for the choppy sequence of events. 
337	I was stoked to do acid for the first time and I was hyped for spring break, I chose my room as the place to trip. I took one tablet of 200 μg LSD the day I got out of school for spring break. I let the paper sit on my tongue for about 30 minutes and then I chewed it up and swallowed it. It was around 8:30 pm and I kept looking in the mirror to see if my eyes were dilated, they werent. I kept waiting as I layed in my bed. I cant remember whether I was meditating as I waiting for it to kick in or what. 
338	Eventually it did kick in and the first thing I remember doing is rolling around in my bed, laughing to myself. Then my sister came into my room, apparently I disturbed her by rolling around too much in my bed or something. To my surprise I was able to talk to her normally and I told her I was sorry and Id try to keep to keep it down. The reason why I was rolling around so much is because I loved he way the acid made my body feel, silky and elevated, and my head felt just wierd, but I enjoyed every second of it 
339	The next thing I remember doing is stripping out of my clothes and walking around in my room stark naked. I think I might have been dancing for a few seconds too. After a while I got horny and decided it would be a fantastic idea to jerk off on acid. It took a bit of effort but it was worth it because when I orgasmed I closed my eyes and a explosion of color took life under my eyelids and the orgasm felt sublime. 
340	After masturbating I laid in my bed, and decided just to let my new found euphoria take over. I was rubbing my hands up and down my body and I just kept drooling, I let it roll down my face and down my neck. I let my mind wander as I laid on my bed, It felt like I was floating but not at the same time. After a while I decided to get out of bed to use the restroom, before doing so I decided to put my clothes back on incase someone saw me. I took a piss and it felt strange peeing on acid, I felt it run through my entire system before leaving my body. After that, I just sat on the toilet seat and noticed my skin looked very stange, my veins looked like snakes slithering underneath my skin. As I left the bathroom, my mom was standing outside the door asking me if I was alright, I said I just had to use the bathroom really bad and she believed me.
341	Around 1 or 2 am I picked up my D.S. and started to play New Super Mario Bros. Quite frankly I was disappointed that it didnt look trippier on acid. And after that I decided to go to sleep. The next morning I felt the effects had completely gone away. However I look back on this experience as a positive one and I would do it again.

344	Hello guys I just thought I would share the best trip of my life that happened the other day
345	I ended up getting a Vial of LSD from a friend of mine containing a few drops of L. I ended up using the drops of course and was left with an empty Vial. This was some very strong acid and when I did it before 2 drops on a sour patch kid send me to another dimension. Little did I know what I was in for with this rinse.
346	12:00 p.m. dosed 4 mg of Klonopin and went to my friends. 
347	12:45 p.m start feeling the effects of the klonopin, my body is feeling loose and relaxed this is when I decide to light up a joint. 
348	1:00 arrive at my friends hung out with him and his family and smoked a few bowls before I had to leave. This is when I was feeling great.
349	2:00 p.m. arrive back at home and begin contemplating on enjoying a trip but did not want  to waste the acid due to the klonopin.
350	3:00 p.m. I finally decide to trip, but how? I have tabs and the coal but I decided to use the vial to see if a rinse is as strong as everyone says. I begin to pour a small amount of bottled water into the vial. I begin to squeeze it on the cap repeatedly and shaking it as hard as possible . I decide to put enough water in it for 2 doses and that was a great idea for me because if I did it all I would have lost it. I began to put half the liquid in my mouth and swallow. 
351	3:30 rolled a joint to smoke before the trip began, but I'm too late. I was already tripping hard. I begin to smoke and the acid is heavy. I start to become paranoid because I have never felt a come up this strong.
352	4:30 begin to peak hard. Tracers are everywhere. No matter what I look at it is morphing and tracing into multiple objects. And the colors wow was this a colorful trip. I was feeling so amazed by this drug. I feel like the acid is massaging my body, I feel so comfortable. I texted my friend and wanted to go hangout with him since I was tripping hard all by myself. The road looked like a cartoon. The trees were swaying everywhere and since it was a rainy day the rain literally was red, green, purple, and pink.
353	5:00 arrive at my friend's safely. We began to play games and he decided Cuphead would be perfect for me and boy was he right. The cartoon game was full of colors and tracers. he took a glance at my eyes and there was no color. I looked in the mirror and seen myself but it looked like my whole face was covered in eyes, weird. We wanted to smoke but I left the weed in my car so I went to get it. It must've took me 20 mins to find it even though I knew where it was. My mind was everywhere. It was dark outside and the rugs to my car seemed like arms reaching for me. This was scary but then I finally found it and went in to smoke. We smoked some bong packs and it was blast off time again. I stayed at his place watching Rick and Morty and playing Cuphead it was fun but it was midnight now so I had to leave. I was coming down slowly now but the dark seemed to have light. The rain was still colorful even in the dark. I make it home and decide to watch some music videos.i began to feel tired around 3 a.m. and I had to work at 7 a.m. so I decided to lay down. I close my eyes and wow I see so many things. The closed eyes visuals lead me to a dream like state and I finally fall asleep. 
354	I feel as if I got the full effects from the drug and saw the world in another way. I have tripped many times but this was the best. Please be safe and I hope this was a good description but it's hard for me to remember the details.

357	SO last night I decided to take acid for only the second time in my life. The first time I was 18 and I hated it but I have read a lot about the therapeutic benefits of LSD and thought it would help me to heal. I was on my own in the flat and put some calming music on.
358	I took half a tab at 3pm, and then didnt feel anything so took another half, half hour later, and then again another half, half hour after that. By 5pm I was wasted, I couldnt see properly or stand up, I ended up falling into my bed and just closing my eyes, I cant remember anything that happened, only my mind was racing so fast, I couldnt sleep, I was tossing and turning, so hot and sweaty and uncomfortable, and then finally at 4am I started to feel a little normal again. I was meant to go to work this morning but I was a right mess after no sleep. I'm feeling ok now, 24 hours post drug injestion, but I was just wondering what other peoples experience was. Did I take too much, was the environment not good? I must say I never want to take it again! I have DMT and find that a much more powerful and healing experience.

361	I woke in the summer morning at my parents cape house and had the urge to have an LSD experience. I took 200ug after waking up not worrying about being around my parents whilst on the substance. I sat on the couch in the living room listening to music and watching the tv waiting for the substance to kick in. Within 30 minutes I could feel the effects coming on. It felt simply wonderful. I was relaxed, excited, and enthusiastic about the experience to come. I felt at home as the psychedelic headspace began to take hold as I've had many experiences before and know how to navigate through the experience. I was eating a banana and enjoying a cup of coffee when I started to notice tracers from the motion of things and people. My thoughts were clear as ever and the effects felt simply wonderful. I had no qualms about being around my parents. As a matter of fact, I felt more at ease around them than I usually do, which was great. We decided we were going to have a beach day. The car ride to the beach was fun. I sat, composed, listening to music. It sounded wonderful. When we arrived at the beach, the visual effects were noticeable. The clouds had geometric royal-esque appearances to them. Watching the birds fly around above the water was amusing as the sun shone down on the shore. The headspace during the experience was wonderful. This was no doubt the correct dose for the occasion. The landscape was perfect for the experience. Colors were vibrant and the landscape were fantastic to view. Sitting in a chair on the beach, watching the scene in front of me couldn't have been less grand. It was an experience for the ages.

364	One day when experimenting I decided to drop some LSD, not necessarily for recreational purposes, and not to ever be intended again but to expand my consciousness and realize that there are other things to be known out their other than what we can see, also for spirtitual awareness, I theorized this whole concept that everything is connected we are all one, we all link to each other and all exist together as god. We are all god this experience was so amazing that it changed my life forever I realized that the world, universe and life is black and white, not literal yet figuratively. There is always an opposite of something no matter what one thinks it is there is something somewhere that is the EXACT opposite of anything one can think of. I experienced this whole world and shared my own experiences with others. I look at LSD not as a drug, yet a tool for knowing and prepairing for what we will be when we leave this plane. On my trip fractals also came in to play and the literal circle of life hallucination, which was EXTREMELY spiritual and I will never forget for the rest of my entire time spent on this plane. I realized that fractals are found everywhere in the universe which other scientists have also discovered but I realized that the infinite of these fractals are forever because the answer to the question of life is always going to try to be found in everything including the earth, which I believe is a living animal just as us. Fractals are these questions left to search for the answer for life, forever and ever searching for this logical explanation, which will never logically be answered. Since my life was changed that night I knew that their was another plane other than where we are living, that is the complete opposite of this material plane, scientist have also discovered something known as anti-mater which has been created in huge pipe tubes at labs underground, scientists discovered that when they get electrons traveling fast enough they put it through and anti siphon filter that turns the charge of the positive electron to a negative. This negative electron is known as Anti-matter and thus is basically a mirror image of the original electron itself this anti-matter is exactly what matter is not. There is a whole other world out there that does exist that we cannot see but 
365	is very real, as a matter in fact even more real than matter itself here on earth that we are all eventually going to experience.

368	I've taken acid quite a few times in the past. I've had many good trips, such as wandering in what seemed like an enchanted forest with friends to extremely bad trips like hours of not being able to breath properly with my heart pounding in my ears. I've never had a trip even remotely like the one I had about fifteen years ago.
369	I took some with another girl. She ended up scratching her skin to bloody pieces thinking things were crawling all over her. I totally felt like I perceived another reality. I couldn't move my body as it was just a bunch of molecules moving around. I couldn't see our three dimensional world at all. The air around me was alive and moving, and I saw many dwarf-like beings moving around intently doing things, but unaware that I could see them. My body was melted into the atmosphere so I couldn't move. To this day I'm convinced that the drug somehow opened my awareness to another dimension that we normally can't sense. Ever since that trip I feel like perhaps there is other life out there, but with our human perceptions, we can't begin to understand them.
370	Do you think I'm crazy? Was it lsd that I took? Have you heard of anyone else having a similar experience? Why did the other girl have a dif experience? Did we take dif amounts? Were we poisoned? I don't recall the specifics, other than we were told the tabs were saved from the '60's and there might have been two different kinds. The thing I will never forget is that was the most far out trip I've ever had, and it altered my belief systems and brought a whole new way of thinking. After all, we are just a bunch of molecules, perhaps somehow all joined together...

372	I had gotten the purple microdots from my friend Tommy who had taken them before and agreed to be my guide.  At about 9 pm we dosed and then just chilled and listened to music as we waited.  What happened next can only be described as full on hallucination of mind body and soul.  Vision of pure fantasy, feelings of pleasure and joy and an awakening of my soul to the universe.  These visions lasted for only three or four hours before I could tell that they were waning. 6 am was the greatest sunrise ever.  All that day after my face hurt from all the smiling I had done the night before.  Flashbacks lasted for many months but never eclipsed that first experience. There can only be a one first time and one should always use a guide.

375	A friend and I took one tab of a new batch that I got recently, looking forward to a nice trip with a walk in Central Park. Unfortunately, even though I purposefully didn't take my meds that morning, it wasn't enough time for them to dissipate enough to actually get a real trip out of it. I *felt* slightly trippy (eg a tiny bit queasy) and if I let my eyes relax and stared at a tree or whatever I could get a little bit of visuals, but my friend reported a really heavy, good trip with lots of visuals and I didn't have that at all. 
376	I looked the next day and apparently it takes 16 days for Abilify to be out of your system, and 5 days for Wellbutrin. I had thought because they're not SSRIs it'd be enough to just not take them that day and they wouldn't dampen the LSD, but I was wrong, oh well.

379	I'm somewhat new to the psychedelic drug world.  I've done mushrooms a few times, with decent results and salvia divinorum with no results.  Having been blasted with the idea that LSD is the ultimate psychedelic, I was prepared for intensity of my first trip, which never came.
380	The drug simply made me think, for a really long time.  I was awake for hours having these seemingly in depth conversations with my friend.  At one point at about 6:30 am, we went outside to watch the sunrise and I was awe stricken and humbled by the heavens above.  At one point a jet passed by and it was so intense I fell to my knees.  I was simply humbled by the drug, and was not getting any visual affects from it.  My friend took the same dose, and he's done LSD many times before, and he tripped pretty hard, so I know the acid was good.
381	When we went inside, this was pretty comical.  We ran into my friends father who, of course asked why we were outside at 7am, and we calmly explained to him that we were on acid and couldn't sleep.  We had a brief conversation and proceeded back to my friends room.
382	It was only at this point I noticed any visuals at all, perhaps because of the changes in lighting from outside to inside.  I noticed his floor waving like water, it was a blue carpet.  Most noticeable was his face began melting and moving in ways similar to the animation in the movie 'Waking Life'.  I mentioned it to him, and he laughed, happy that I had any visuals at all.
383	Next time, he recommended smoking marijuana to increase the liklyhood of a visual experience.  I may do it again, but not very soon, it's really not worth it at this point.

387	My friends Chris and Alex were over at a good friend of theirs' house one friday night, and I had to work. I was planning on going over there and dropping acid for the first time after work, but things didn't work out well. I ended up over at Chris' apartment the following Wednesday, and I dropped my two hits then.
388	My history with psychedelics is as follows: I have eaten chocolates on several occasions, I frequently eat DXM, I have tried morning glory seeds, and of course I smoke herb on a daily basis.
389	Anyway, I popped the two hits in my mouth at around 7:30 and sucked on them for a good 5 minutes, making sure that they were soaked into my tongue, and then swallowed them. I jammed with Chris for a while, not really paying attention to anything. About an hour later, I realized that I was not experiencing any effects. Alex suggested that my onset was just slower than most people's. I didn't want to believe it, but I did and went outside to smoke a cigarette. At 9:45 I was beginning to think that Alex had fucked me over with fake acid, but I watched him cut my hits from the same blotter him and C had done the previous Friday. I kept waiting for any psychedelic effects, but they never came and I finally went to sleep around 4:30.
390	Let me also say that I have eaten chocolates before to extremely minor, if any, effects. Meanwhile, Chris always trips out of his mind when he eats those.
391	I don't understand why I could eat these psychedelics and not feel a damn thing?

394	Just me and a friend in my apartment. Took 2 doses and it came on quick. My friend turned on some Grateful dead and we sat with our eyes closed. Now about the time that space came on I was in a world of pros and cons. I was looking at every action and it was spinning off into infinite possibilites. I have been to this place many times and I was totally comfortable here. Then a sound came into my being. It was disrupting me. In that moment when I thought that I couldnt take it anymore and I was about to pop a very funny thing happend.   My head opened like a lotus, and I ejected into space. For a moment I was sitting weightless totally content and at peace with the infinite. Then infront of me a vibration started. It was was almost like space and time was ripping apart. I started to become restless and afraid. Then out of nothing something started to appear. At first it was just a speck then out of that speck a hand fractled out ward untill there were infinite hands all with eyeballs in the palm. The a body and a head followed. I looked on in wonder at the sight before me. Then I could do nothing but open my eyes, and when I did I was totally sober. LSD IS a hell of a drug!

399	So, I recently just found a very reliable acid connection. It being something that I always wanted to do I went and bought some the day I found out about it. Instead of waiting for a good day when I could hang out with friends I chose a night that I had to sleep in my own house. Having experimented with salvia before and loving it I had real high hopes for acid.
400	So I took it and sat down in my room to watch Dude, Wheres my Car. I  got to the ostrich scene and still nothing happened. I was pretty angry. But then I got a phonecall and my friend invited me to go smoke with him and some other kids. I went outside and then I just felt a little bit off, I couldn't really put it into words. I saw lots of stuff flying around in the sky but I still couldn't tell you if it was birds or not.
401	I actually have a lot of sober hallucinations, I constantly see people looking at me or walking around staring at me. Its been going on for years, so I'm just used to it now.
402	But anyway, I met up with the kids and smoked probably 4 bowl packs before I got dropped back off at home. There were no increases from when I left my house, so I figured my source wasn't as reliable as I had thought. I turned on the crazy asian flick Battle Royale and fast forwarded it to when they are inside the school. Then all of a sudden from the top right corner of my vision it turned bright lime green. I could see the light reflecting on things around and when it very quickly dropped to the bottom let corner of my vision.
403	I sat in awe for a moment because I didn't think it could happen so suddenly. Then everything started to glow and change between blue, green, red, purple, orange, and yellow. Then everything had its own individual pulse, everything just pulsated for so long. I started to watch the movie in complete awe, and realized I was so into it that my eyes were watering almost the entire time.
404	I finished with that and wet into my basement and played with my pure white persian cat. He wasnt pure white when I was petting him, but he still rocked. For hours that went on, then I finally fell asleep.

407	I met a friend at Marsascala and I took half a hit at 8pm. 9pm nothing, 10pm nothing, went home, nothing.
408	11pm: I was in front of my computer, I began to see all the colours of the rainbow then time had no meaning. I became aware that I was 23 years earlier in side my mother's womb and in 70 years at the most I would be dead and buried. What is the significance of 70 years when 70 years from now, there will be only the past and no future. I felt that there was nothing after life, we are only mammals ant that thought was horrible. I always thought that there was life after death and that's what is beautiful. But now I realized the opposite. There is nothing, we are only a bunch of chemicals and we will get dissolved into nature. Just as there was no I before 23 years ago, there will be no I after I die.
409	I thought: what's the great thing if I die? So much people have died! There are so many people who will live.
410	Well after the 3 days I spent in this state I became involved in a religious movement that promoted life after death. I want life after death! If there is no life after death its not worth living.

412	It was my first time. I took some really good shit. I got really hyper and talked more than I ever have in my entire life. I was also really loud and talked so fast that no one could understand me. I wasn't in any kind of controlled environment and there was nothing safe about where I was. I was with some friends though. I remember that I wasn't paranoid at all like some people are. In fact, we were walking down the street to a party. We all took the same shit, everyone was paranoid except me. Nothing too exciting happened at the party. On the walk home though I got really dehydrated. My friend took me to some guys driveway and I passed out. She got them to get some water. Some how they got me to wake up and I drank the water. I felt a lot better after that but it was really scary. I couldn't breathe very well and I got really dizzy. Also, the only kind of hallucination I had was while walking home (this was after I got dehydrated), a sign grew arms and pulled me towards it. I ran straight into the pole. That hurt like hell. I really like acid and have continued to take it. My only recommendations are that the user drink lots of water. Plus, it helps to drink something like orange juice as well.

415	I think it opens up a part of my mind that would otherwise stay closed.  It gives me a new perspective on life. 
416	I have tripped many times, but the time that I felt it the most was when I took 2 geltabs with many of my friends.  First, after about 40 minutes after ingestion, everyone became overwhelmed with euphoria to the extreme.  A smile became plastered on each of our faces.  Everything seemed so funny and I became incredibly happy.  But, we didn't actually start seeing visuals until a couple of hours later.  Slowly, you start thinking of some crazy shit that seems to make perfect sense.  Its impossible to explain exactly what trippin is like, is has be to experienced.
417	Once the visuals started it was amazing.  I never thought the mind could do crazy shit like that.  And it's great because you think clearly while seeing awsome hallucinations.  First, we went outside and sat under the stars in this vine-covered patio.  Everything twisted around and looked a bit fucked up.  I started moving my hand around this table and it looked likt the whole table was spinning in mid-air.
418	Another visual was when we were inside.  I sat at the top of the stair looking down at the brown carpet.  The whole carpet looked like a pool of quicksand.  It looked like they, my friends, were sinking into the carpet.  And in the kitchen it looked like the floor was a grate with some goo spilling up through the cracks.  Every slight crack in the wall would look like a huge hole and would pulsate bigger than smaller.  I could also see sound in a way.  The walls would move to the beat of the music, like huge drums. 
419	We stayed up the whole night and my friend, who's a dumbass had to work the next day.  We convinced him that he had to ride 10 miles to work on a bike because there was no way he could get a ride.  Actually, his mom could have given him a ride, but we convinced him otherwise.  He ended up riding all the way to work on a shitty bike with flat tires at 4:00 in the morning.  It was the funniest shit ever.  I remember everything about the night, but most of it just can't be explained with words, at least unless a person has tried it and knows what I'm talking about.

423	I have done many many drugs, but lsd has been my favorite so far. This is because I love ethogens, and how they make your mind work.This is what happened to me after I took lsd, how it changed me. I took 3 hits of acid, put it under my tongue, waited, took an hour and a half to kick in, but when it did, everything was alive and talking to me.  Skeletons grew out of my basement floor and we hungout for 6 hours while listened to the grateful dead. But my favorite thing about it was, I could feel love flowing through my veins, for the first time I understood the beatles. Of course, all you need is love! Since that break through, I havent been angry, I've been frustrated, I've been irritated, but not angry. Life is way better now, I used to constantly ask people about what they thought of 2012, and the end of the world, now.. Doesnt bother me. So thats my conclusion, lsd has opened my eyes, made me a new person.

425	I have taken acid only twice before this trip.  Later that day I have obtained 5 hits from a friend, he said they were very strong. That night I decided to take 4 of the 5 I had, I wanted to go over and beyond. I put them in my mouth and noticed I could actually taste a slight chemical taste as I chewed on them. I then sat back on my bed and waited for my trip to begin.
426	> 20 min later: getting board and so I start reading.
427	> 40 min later: start feeling my jaws get tense and teeth feel - somehow different.
428	> 60 min later: feel jolts of energy run through my body and notice slight close eye visuals and also slight open eye
429	> 80 min later: heavy closed eye visuals and notice my shades and carpet spiraling and flash colors, music sounds different somehow.
430	100 min later: started drawing on poster board but then noticed that the sides of the board started to bubble up and start smoking.   I found that my lamp was giving off intense heat and my room felt like a oven.
431	120 min later:  cat jumps on my bed and his hair starts to singe as he gets closer to the light. I picked up my glass of water and  found I could not drink out of it because the water was boiling be fore my eyes! By this time I saw my bed start to smoke. And my arm start to bubble up a bit.
432	125 min later: as I reach to turn off my lamp my fingers start to melt and drops of flesh spash on the carpet. I get scared and sit back on my bed realizing that my toes are metaphorically catching fire and as well start to melt off my foot.  By this time the hair on my legs are totally gone and my bed catches on fire!  I lay down again and this time have my legs off my bed extended straight out to watch my toes.  Then notice my knee cap bubles up and catches on fire.  About 4 to 5 min after watching this my leg melts off my thigh it drops but I don't hear it hit the ground.  I don't remember much after this but I remember I tripped for about 6 or 7 hours.

434	 It was winter in 2003. I was sitting around my house my parents were gone on business. I found an old vial filled with small blotter papers. I knew what they were when I saw them. I decided to take two and see what would happened. Nothing happened. So I took 2 more. I gave up. I went to bed.
435	Not long after a few hours tops I woke up around 4 am for reasons unknown turned on the light and the world was different. My bedsheet that had little black dots on it was moving up and down and the dots turned into triangles and back to dots. I walked down my hall which seemed to continue forever into the bathroom where I saw my pupils were completely diallated. I adventured to my computer to talk to people online. It took it forever to start. My whole body was knumb I felt no pain. The walls were breathing. I got up and stared at a clock and every 4 seconds in my mind was 1 second. I couldn't sleep that whole night. I stayed up listening to my mp3 player. I had to go to school. My sister gave me a ride she had no clue what was going on. The first thing that happened when I got into school was all my friends knew I was blown out. The tiles on the floor where like a never ending chess board. The lockers on the walls were brilliant colors and everyone was beautiful. In total my adventure lasted 7 hours. 2 hours to start. I've already used up the rest of the blotters foolishly.

438	The fourth time I experimented with LSD, it was a perfect day on Miami Universities Western campus.  Everyone in our expanded group of friends was tripping.  The happiest day of my life.  Several hours into the trip, while walking down the hallway of my dorm, I began feeling intense energy currents swelling up from the earth.  Walking, dancing, moving with this energy towards my room, I began to wonder if I could do something with this energy, like using the force (star wars).  When I got to my room and sat down on my bed I felt the energy rise up through my body and exit my head (third eye?)  As this occurred my friend Brian was launched several feet backwards, stumbling.  He looks directly at me in sheer amazement, 'Was that you?'  Yes, it was. Part me, part mystery.  My life has since been not the same.  It was a climax of sorts, as I had been moving in the direction of metaphysics and latent abilities of the mind for years.  The question that followed was, why this particular experience happened to me?  What does this mean?  The short answer: reality is way more than most people realize.  But researching psychedelic experiences I have yet to find another story that talks about people using energy to manipulate the physical.

441	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
442	So this is my first trip report but the intensity of the situation requires it I feel. So to start I managed to procure some really high quality 110ug blotters from the deep web and I had planned a cool trip night for me and a bunch of my friends. Im going to use false names to protect the identity of the people involved. It was I, landon, jesse, spencer, Jordan, Elliot, randy, spencer, and dean. At around 9:45pm I arrived at the trip spot (landons house) and all my friends were there eager to have a cool acid experience, This was landons and elliots first time. 
443	I had planned in advance to take a really high dose because I wanted to have some revelations and ultimately ego death. The dosages were Elliot-1 tab landon-2 tabs Jesse- 4 tabs dean-2 tabs Jordan-1 tab and I did 5. 
444	So we all dropped and everything was going good and flowing smoothly and oh boy did I start to feel it. Around an hour in someone requested I pull my car forward but the visuals were so intense when I stepped outside I was honestly impressed, when I sat down in the drivers seat of my car j glanced in the mirror and saw one of the street lights behind me and saw it swirl and there was a strong tracer. At that point I decided that this was a poor decision and I had misjudged the intensity of the acid I had just took, so I hopped out of the car and asked Jordan to back it up for me. 
445	The problem I knew I was about to run into was flow, I knew I would be relied upon to keep it flowing nicely for the group but I knew I wouldnt be able to provide for much longer I knew I would be relied upon to keep it flowing nicely for the group but I knew I wouldnt be able to provide for much longer so on my way back in I took some really deep breaths and paced myself for a potential anxiety nightmare. When I got back inside everything was still going good, Elliot and randy were sitting there playing madden having a good time and then the visuals and mindfuck hit me so super super hard, I honestly wasnt anticipating it. I'm a pretty experienced psychonaut and I'm aware that LSD is a pretty malleable substance if you know how to work with it, but damn, the situation became really anxious and tense. Randy had a really bad trip and he thought someone died and he was super anxious but somehow I never even noticed and I feel really bad about that. I kept looking up and I thought the situation was just normal and I was just too tripped out to comprehend but in reality everybody else in the group was equally as anxious as me. 
446	Landon was unable to handle LSD, LSD isnt necessarily or everybody and I dont put any blame on him but he seriously was unable to keep track of thoughts, I'm unsure exactly what happened but there was a really anxious situation and he thought everyone was against him and he got super hostile toward everyone in the room and he ended up projectile vomiting on the floor and just leaving the room to go lay down and at that point shit got crazy. Spencer thought somebody died and was freaking the fuck out and ended up laying down just so he could be out of this mess. In my head I was flying through other lifetimes following an energy beam, the term rolling comes to mind to perfectly describe what I was feeling I swear I lived other lives during that time frame where I was following that energy beam around, the visuals were so intense that I didnt know which reality was the real one. 
447	At that point I just decided to ride it out and see what happens, there was music playing with a good baseline in the background of the room and there was a bong being passed around but I was way too trippy to understand that. I slightly came back to reality for a second and Elliot walked over to me and lit the bong for me and man was that the most majestic thing I had ever seen, I dont know why but just that sight of him lighting that and me killing it with the bass dropping in the background was one of the most intense things I had ever felt, after I came down enough to be back in reality the vibes in the room were awesome. Landon was back and everybody was vibing and smoking bud, I had my vape out and we were chain vaping. 
448	There was a moment where randy sat next to me and tried to talk to me but I didnt notice he was in distress and now I feel bad about it because he has a negative outlook on us all. Me and jesse decided to go outside for a little bit to see what everything looked like and it was still so visually intense that it was hard to handle so we went back inside and got some drinks and chilled for a little bit. Something to know about landon is that he always just kind of has this edge to him, like hes hiding something or he has something balled up inside so I tried to talk to him about it, just to strike some good conversation and explain to him that nobody here hates him and the anxiety was just caused by him being in the middle of it. But he just wasn't having it and he thought we all hated him. He instantly showered me with hostility and the whole vibe got anxious again and it became really shitty. So me jesse and dean decided to go outside once again and just sit and chill. Dean is usually anxious in his day to day life, he expressed this to me a while back but I figured if he really wanted to trip I'd involve him in it too, but this wasnt a good plan. While we were sitting outside dean just kept being super anxious and it rubbed off on jesse pretty bad and at that point he got really scared and confused. I went back in the house and laid on the couch and watched futurama but jesse just kept going in and out of the house looking really worried about something. 
449	Eventually I came outside and saw him sitting in his car damn near to the point of tears, he needed to be home really soon but the drugs still had us both seeing so visually intense that driving would be a huge task. I tried everything I could to keep him from leaving but I know how this goes so eventually I took the plunge and stopped trying to convince him from leaving. I was really worried about jesse, I didnt want him to crash his beloved car or get a dui or even worse die, but I put my faith in him and just laid on the couch super anxious for about an hour thinking about how I'll forever have that on my conscience. I shot jesse a text at around 11am and asked if he got home alright and his exact words were yeah dude how the fuck did I not die and at the moment a huge grin hit my face and I was almost put into tears over the amount of weight that was pulled off my shoulders. 
450	Around 1 everybody was still asleep and my visuals had worn mostly off but there was still a really heavy body load and I was ready for the drugs to be gone. I hopped in my car and drove back to my house to grab a Xanax I had stashed for the purpose and popped it, about 10 minutes later I felt a lot better. After that I went to hang out with another friend of mine and we smoked a little cannabis and I went back home drank some orange juice and passed out hardcore. I slept for 18 hours but oh man did I need that. 
451	Overall my experience was good because I finally experienced ego death and saw that rolling energy I've always read about but it was super exhausting, I'm at the point where I've accomplished all I had ever hoped to accomplish on LSD and I think I'm gonna stop with it for now and explore the peaks of shrooms. Overall 10/10

453	LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
454	1355 - 3 tabs of acid for breakfast. I was in a good/happy mind when I took the 3 tabs I was sick and miserable so I might as well have fun while I am sick.
455	1430 - get home started having panic attacks/feeling happy, lay down to take a nap sleep for about 2 hours while I was having auditory hallucinations, when the fan in the room I was in vibrated weirdly. It produced a kaleidoscope fractal effect, and I was exploring the various rooms of my mind. I was talking to it the thing that makes every thing while I was exploring the rooms in my mind.
456	1630 - Don't remember much, I do remember grabbing the trash can in my bathroom. I was surrounded by darkness, I remember grabbing it. I opened my eyes to a super bright black and white flashing of nonsensical symbols with a pyramid with an eye on the left side of my vision. Lay back down. I remember feeling hot/slightly warm with my left hand feeling cold.
457	1700 - I wake up feeling terrible my whole body in pain, I drank some water and went into my sisters room. I grabbed a trash can and a fucking ice cream cone, I puked up the water I just drank then downed the ice cream cone. After I was done with it I put a cherry hard candy in my mouth and it was like tasting the color red, I bit down on it and my mouth started to hurt. This was in a red and blue haze.
458	1745 - It begins I am the master of time I could see 24 seconds into the past and the future. I eat a steak that still tasted like steak had a wierd fuzzy texture. I was in a red and blue glitch world with the ability to control time. After I was done with my steak I was waving my fork around and there was a trail coming off of it and I named it bob the trail snake and with him I started wandering around my house. I drank 1/2 a coke and I threw that up but not my steak. The coke tasted like fucking dirt.
459	1945 - Bob was gone and I was in a world of vivid colors and spaztastic rainbows. I don't remember much other then I met a dragonfly that was about 12 feet in length made of pure fucking rainbows in all of its epileptic glory. I watched some anime and played osu a rhythm game. It was like I was on adderall and snorted 4 lines of cocaine spazing out doing shit at 400 miles a second. My trip was like this for a while.
460	0300 - I finally clam my tits, I am staring at my floor rolling and shaking, I stare at it for about 30 min.
461	0330 - I cooked some macncheese because I was feeling hungry, it tasted weird somewhat like a creamy lemon flavor but wasn't unpleasant so I eat it anyways. I am feeling dirty after I ate so I decided to take a shower.
462	0400 - Shower time this was really fun the water was ticklely and felt very nice and warm I scrubbed my self and it felt very wierd like a ticklely itch. I rinsed off the soap and dried myself off.
463	0430 - I am naked and I just sit on my couch staring into the black nothingness from some reason this was very entertaining/ I decided that music would go along great with this and looked from my phone and played some jazz music. I decided that the couch was uncomfy and moved to my bed.
464	0550 - I am laying in my bed listing to jazz with a blanket over my face, I started seeing fractals again with some other weird visuals I sit there for about an hour doing this.
465	0650 - I talked about my trip with a person in a discord server I was in. At this point my trip was all but over I was still seeing some tracers and shit but other than that I was fine. I talked to him for about 2 hours.
466	0850 - He gets off and I just watch youtube videos till I stopped seeing shit. Took 2 hours.
467	1050 - I go to a store with my mom get some drinks and some gum then lay down and sleep, in my sleep I was talking to it and explored the rooms in my mind some more.

469	This past Friday I had a repeat experience that managed to stick with me when I landed. I realized it wasn't the first time, but it was the most obvious and the most...um...real.
470	I came up on two gel tabs....not a large dose by any means, but enough. I usually trip alone and I like to explore the interwebs. While typing I noticed I had, what looked like, a piece of cobweb floating from my fingers. Instinctively I reached to pull it off with my other hand. I could actually feel the sticky pull as I tried to remove it from my fingers. Unable to remove it I took a closer look and watched it disappear.
471	I know this isn't the first time I've seen these smokey tendrils attached to my fingers or arm, but it is the clearest and most real.

474	It was a normal night, I was partying over at my buddy's house and we were rockin pretty hard.  Rounds and rounds of quarters and anchorman.  Lots and lots of beer and wine, plus a dance party.  This went on until about 1 am and we decided we needed more alcohol so we went to go get more.  We left with a couple of people I didn't really know well but one of them yelled out, 'Let's go get my acid!' and my eyes lit up.  I've had quite a few amazing trips from acid and it treated me well so I was down.  
475	We got to his house and he came out with a few blotter tabs.  Keep in mind I was still hammered at this point.  He then proceeded to give the hits out to each of us.  'Here's your hit, here's yours...'  I took mine and could taste the bitterness of the LSD on my paper.  This was usual but I had never tasted it this strong.  I asked him if he knew if it was dropped or dipped or what.  He said it was soaked in LSD and pretty fresh from the chemist.  I got excited and then realized it was 2:30 am.  I was like man I'm tired because I was still very drunk.  So I got dropped off at my house and fell asleep.  
476	I woke up exactly 3 hours after I took the dose.  It was 5:30 a.m. and I realized I was tripping!  Then I remembered the kid saying something repeatedly through the night...It was that the acid took 3 hours to kick in.  I walked around the house for a while and saw some crazy things.  I also watched a movie until my cousin came into the room and said she was going to work.  Then she looked at me and asked, 'why the hell are you awake?'  I told her my crazy drunken story and she said come outside we'll smoke a cig.  We did and squirrels were everywhere.  They kind of scared me a little, but they were friendly it seemed.  Then I was looking at the trees and they seemed to be smiling at me.  It was pretty wild.  
477	After tripping for many hours it became 4pm and I seemed to have come down.  It was time for me to go to work.  I smoked a joint with my bud on the way and of course, the trip came back somewhat or was prolonged.  I walked into work with this wild awareness about me.  I did really well on the phones but my cubicle was pretty wild.  The walls were definitely breathing for the most part.  Anyways, all in all, a great trip, just very strange and tired at work.  Acid can be great fun and even better if you take it at a better time than I did haha.  Trip safely and as always love and peace!!!

479	LSD is a powerful drug.  It can provide the user with invaluble insight or plunge them into the depths of insanity.  It's impossible for the first time user to know what will occur, so do not decide whether or not to use this drug lightly.  I've been lucky, and found the drug to be a window into insight.  I'd like to share my most recent experience.
480	In university, I was a borderline acidhead.  At the time of my last experience (Jan 2006), it had been four and a half years since I used the drug.  I was in the midst of some major life changes, and wanted to be able to once again analyze my life through the looking glass of LSD.
481	I dosed with M, a long time friend of mine.  Also present was D, a friend not quite a babysitter as he was smoking plenty of marijuana with us, but not joining the acid trip.  M and I dosed at 3:30pm.
482	3:30pm- We dose and take a trip to the supermarket with the currently sober D.  There are no major effects during the trip.
483	4:30pm- We are back at D's apartment, and the drug is starting to noticably create shifts in reality.  We will mostly stay at D's apartment for the remainder of the trip.  Although I used to enjoy the roving, unpredictable acid trip, I now wish for a comfortable environment to explore innerspace.
484	5:00pm- I'm busy ripping CD's into mp3's when my attention span allows (I was soon to move overseas and wanted to bring my music on a hard drive).  We end up puttin on the Boards of Canada 'Campfire Headphase' disc, which creates an ocean of sonic space for our acid fried minds.  D is now smoking from his bong, and we are happy to join him.  We play a few games of Fireball Island (children of the 80's might know this) and Texas Hold Em'.  Although we are able to stay within the parameters of the games,  there are quite a few verbal tangents and side trips.
485	5:30pm- We all share some strange threats and confusing words in the kitchen.  It's all in jest, but even this could throw a more unstable mind or first-time user into a state of panic (aka the bad trip).  We get past it and break out the 40 year old scotch.  Of course it burns, but the ambient flavors shine through the lysergic prism.
486	6:00pm- I put on an episode of 'The Flash.'  Unfortunately, no one really wants to join me through my nostalgiac flight of fancy (in other words, they hate it).  I still dig it.
487	7:00pm- M and I are reaching our peak.  D is preperly stoned.  We get into some music videos.  The Chris Cunningham clips (especially my first viewing of Aphex Twin's 'Windowlicker') create a disturbing view of the world.  I prefer the Michel Gondry clips with their fractal view of the world.
488	7:30pm- M throws 'San Andreas' into the X-Box.  It's a fine game, but I don't really think it finds the unique experience of LSD.  Nevertheless, we take turn playing it for the next 45 minutes and immerse ourselves in the video world.
489	8:30pm- D is feeling sober enough to take us on a group trip to the Arby's drive though.  It's a typical enough experience, but M and I are still having a very strange time.
490	9:00-11:00pm- Although most of the time dilation occurred earlier in the evening, this is where things become a blur.  The hours are filled with video games, music, Texas Hold Em', and Poker, but I can't recall the quantities or order.
491	11:00pm-12:30am- I'm back to ripping CDs as I wait to sober up.  Everyone's energy is waning.
492	12:30am- I'm sober enough to drive so I take M home and head to my own place.  The LSD is very clean and I'm able to sleep by 2am.  The next day I was perfectly fine with no hangover.
493	Final thoughts-  Unfortunately, I feel I missed some of the insight that I found on earlier trips.  Maybe this was because I arranged such a comfortable time for us all.  My most profound trip was on a camping trip about 5 years ago.  Still, it was a very enjoyable time and I hope it's not my last LSD experience.

497	In a flashing spell of lingering interior flailing bursts, you remain ignorant to a falling corpse of bleeding lizard dreams. It will blind you, I warn, in a second that tears at your senses like the unending sorrow that bursts you with a flavor of the sounds of a pathetic giggling moose country wizard. It comes from the direction of the deranged infinitely screaming reaper who supervises the stimuli of existence. It overwhelms you; the mind piercing pink and orange exploding from his mouth tastes like a photon blast from hell. Then you fall into a frantic steam of euphoria that tickles at your legs and leads its way back to your brain only to wisp in the frolicking cob webs of your past. The browning shrimp gumbo gives way to the sense of emprisonment the redbird once felt when his feathers were trapped in a sling. Freedom you thought you experienced is now a summit of yellow pleasure the ever famous mockingbird intertwines within your being, and the ever slowly descending popcorn wave is a sea in the eyes of a corn field reaper.

500	I actually tried LSD several times before the EVENT I am about to descibe (which was on 3-28-89 at the Omni in Atlanta- just looked up the exact date AND setlist on the internet, pretty cool) and even though a few friends and I had experienced some pretty wild things during our frequent acid trips during my 'crazy' college days of 1984-88 this one sticks out in my mind as the 'Big One.' Because Jerry Garcia died in 1995 making it impossible to attend a Dead show as so many did I have fond memeories of the few shows I did make it to, but as far as this acid trips go, this one was diferent because I had never experienced the truly powerful energy being spread around by the thousands of people (all ages although mostly young adults) who were either tripping along with me or were at least very receptive to feelings I was having on acid that I would normally hide
501	unless in a 'safe' area- Not a concert hall! Anyway, I will start at the beginning...
502	My friend had some great acid that I had tried once before when we camped on Cumberland Island. That was a very cool trip when we climbed over a tall fence and sat around in a private cemetery trying to 'come down' before walking on the beautiful unspoiled beach looking at seashells and basically appreciating nature at its finest. That had been only a few weeks before this concert, still in March, which in Georgia usually means great weather. I had been to see the Grateful Dead years before while still in high school and hadn't even gotten drunk before, so all I did was stare at all the strange looking people and hoped the band would play Truckin' or one of the other few songs I would recognize. Now, in March of 1989, I had tripped first on mushrooms then acid several times and knew just about every Grateful Dead song there was (I thought) so was truly pumped up for this concert!
503	My friend and I got to downtown Atlanta at least two hours before the concert so we could check out 'the scene' which was fun- lots of strangely dressed people roaming about but even before we 'dosed' I thought the energy level was positive and attractive. We took the public tranportation (MARTA) which ended up being smart, more on that later. We ate in a chinese restaurant and must have already sampled the two hits (one each) because I remembe rthings getting strange there because the restaurant was crowded with young people in tie-died t-shirts, etc. making the chinese waiters a little uncomfortable. We passed many more dead-heads and all the interesting things to look at, again the dead-heads, made the awkward 'early acid feelings' almost unnoticeable. Standing in line outside of the Omni became intense cause there was a guy beating a loud drum to a slow beat, making me nervous and letting me know that a strong trip was on the way.
504	By the time we slowly entered the 'arena,'  bought a beer, actually found our row (which we found out later didn't matter) the music had already started. Near the aisles were young girls who stood up as the music played and started whirling around with trance-like faces. They scared me! We gave up trying to find our actual seats after both of us were fully tripping now and could have fallen down the stone steps. Counting the numbers of the rows with the blasting music was too much! The Dead finished 'Let the Good Times Roll' which seemed so-o-o appropriate to the way we were feeling! After settling into some chairs, I somehow was able to talk a little to a pretty woman next to me. She had a beautiful smile and after telling me she flew in THAT DAY from Dallas to Atlanta pulled out a large joint and offered to share it with me!
505	My friend declined saying he was tripping too hard and didn't need anything to increase the strong buzz. I, however, smoked the whole joint with her and noticed that YES smoking pot while tripping can increase your buzz. I started to regret what I had done during a few of the songs, but when the band luanched into 'Ramble On Rose' I sang along and felt happy again. I remember seeing Jerry Garcia's smiling face during the silly song 'Don't Ease Me In' as if I was staring at someone a few feet away and I got a warm feeling in my heart that all what would be great.
506	The first set abruptly ended and strong, piercing lights flashed into our eyes. Suddenly the goddess next to me did not seem approachable and I flet like an utter fool. It was cruel to interupt the darkness and a most difficult time to get adjusted to the sudden freedom of having to find something to do until the second set began.
507	I remember wandering around being lost by the loud chatter that was everywhere. I was tripping hard! The second set eventually ended up being great. We moved around during the show a few times, not caring if we could see the stage, just wanting to be able to hear the music and stare at the wonderful colored lights. Truly psychedilic! The most memorable song was 'Playing in the Band' which lasted the longest and was fantastic with the long jamming. At the end of the concert, the mass of people leaving or being in utter confusion like us was overwhelming. We managed to get into a taxi and leave worry free while freakish young people stared into the window, scaring me. The atxi driver commented on the odd-looking people, not knowing that we were not dressed as strangely but were veyr much par tof that scene! 
508	My trip by the way had only icreased for three hours! I was still not even peaking! This experience taught me that acid is unpredicatable in the amount of time trips peak, last, etc. This one was intensified because of the atmosphere. When we were away from the concert experience, my peak finally leveled out and except for a weird feeling in my throat and some weird visuals, I managed to slowly come down and enjoy the experience, knowing it would only be a 'normal'  trip for the next three or four hours.
509	We went out to eat after my friend was able to drive and sat at a restaurant listening to the loud but somehow pleasant noise of the busy street nearby. I was in a blissful state when a passing car threw a beer bottle that only missed my head by inches. It could have been a diaster! But like many of my experiences, it LUCKILY turned out differently. MAY ALL OF YOU FIND INNER-PEACE AND HAVE SUCH LUCK!

511	LSD (2) : General (1), Music Discussion (22), Festival / Lg. Crowd (24)
512	August 2002, the night was young, people partying having a good time. Some one approaches, 'hey you want to split a half hit of acid?' I think to myself, not really, but I want to stay in the same mind set as my boyfriend. My boyfriend takes the hit and rips it in half, eats one half and hands me the other. My worst mistake ever. 
513	The night goes well, I had a fantastic time, and was able to sleep soundly when I wanted to. Next morning as I lifted my head off the couch images of the whole room moved along with my eyes. I shook my head, rubbed my eyes, and the first thing I say to myself is 'oh shit.' I've heard of 'permanant' trips happening to people, but I never really knew what that actually meant. I never thought it would happen to me. I had no clue of what was going on with myself. I kept seeing things move, people that weren't really there, objects appearing really close to my face or extreamly far away, colors, what's happening? 
514	A month later I was visiting with my parents, the psychosis started slowly; little things like forgetting where I put things, deep vivid daydreaming that I almost couldn't wake up from, then the voices started. I could hear people say my thoughts, the madness of voices in my head, slowly I couldn't recognize my own family and had involuntary movements of my arms. During a lucid moment I told my parents I needed to go to the hospital. At that time the hallucinations were so intense, I'd see snakes crawling all over me, worry that I had bugs (I really didn't), the maddening voices, the constant movement of things around me, it was pure hell. Doctors put me on strong medicine that did not stop the hallucinations but weakend my ability to feel anything emotionally, shutting down all my thoughts. I started noticing if I was in a good mood the hallucinations would be silly causing me to laugh, but if I was in a bad mood I was in for a really rough time.
515	Through time I have learned to live with this monster. It's been a year now of constant hallucinating. The hallucinations are not as intense as they first were. I still see people that are not there (I paint clown faces on them now), colors, mainly black, go zooming past my eyes, spheres or balls pass from one hand to the other and into other people's hands, balls of light bounce off of people's heads,almost like a thin layer peeled off of actual people in front of me follow wherever I look, images jump out at me, and when really stressed or over stimulated the voices come back. It's not fun, it's just something I've become accustomed to, and it has improved greatly in the past year. From what I've read this could last 5 years (4 more to go), or permenantly, I pray almost every night and hope that when I wake up in the morning the monster will be gone. Needles to say I do not use drugs or alcohol any more. I was an active addict for 15 years. This has scared me straight. The end.

518	I was able to come across some very potent acid and having had the same stuff before I bought three. I knew this stuff was good but I had no idea how hard it would hit me. My drug background goes as follows, I've had Shrooms, Acid, 5Meo, Salvia, Cocaine, MDMA, and of course MJ. 
519	I decided to take the sacrement at 7:30am so I could have the house to myself all day. After dosing I took a shower because I prefer to at least start out clean, when I trip. After the shower I was just chillin in my bed listening to some trance on the headphones. This went on until about 11:00. This far in I was beginng to get disappointed because even though I was definitly tripping I didn't feel as though I was peaking. My opinion is that it was due to the music choice. I went outside for a cigarette and my mind started thinking in a different pattern. Before I was more focused on the music by being outside and veiwing nature I began to start thinking about my spiritual beliefs amungst other things. This was a time in my life when I was very unsure about my beliefs. This didn't go on too long before I went inside to my room. I turned on some Grateful Dead  which sounded absolutly wonderful. The music moved me and before I knew it I was dancing around the room. I felt as though I was the visualizer for the music. This was odd since it is unheard of that I dance. At this point I knew I was peaking and opted to lay down on the bed. It was about 12:30. I began to focus on an abject in my room. Let me describe the object as best I can. The base is a cone, and at the tip are four skinny arms that are bent in a certain way. These arms are all different colors, blacklight responsive, and they spin around in different directions. However, the design is perfect because I have found that even when not triping I can see the visuals it makes. Anyway the arms began to move off of their designed trajectories. It looked as though some where falling down, and then it would zoom right back up. After this it transformed in a way and instead the arms looked like they were moving up towards the cieling. Like ribbons of color ascending into the sky. As this was happening the beginning heartbeats of Darkside of the moon began to play. And then, in that instant, the entire room took on a new perspective. It was as if a new connection was made inside the supercomputer that is my brain. Like a light switch flicking on my entire field of vision engulfed in visuals at the instant the music on the first track of darkside hits. Having experienced ego loss prior to this I recognized it instantly. My walls began to glimmer as though they were made of bricks of gold. In my window curtain, I saw Timothy Leary's face smiling back at me as if to say, 'There ya go, now ya got it.'  For the entire album of darkiside of the moon I was transcendent. Many, many visions appeared to me, all with my eyes open. The visions were on the curtains and the walls, and the floor, and anything else in my view. The amazing thing was that all the visuals seemed more realistic than most visuals.  Bright white light shone through the wall straight into my eye. It felt as though it was the awesome power of God.  He comforted me, and reassured me that my way of life was rightous. I understood the mind doesn't need our clunky bodies to survive. It has everything it needs to live on in the afterlife. After that I remained in this heavenly place looking down upon the people of earth with more knowledge of life than I had ever thought concievable. The music brought up topics such as money. I began to understand that Gov't and society was a huge joke. I was shown many more images, however some of which are deeply personal and others I have not fully understood yet. The state of transcendance lasted until the last note of Darkside. I was thrown back into my body on earth and at that moment there was a laughter in the music and I began to laugh as well.

522	Well. I took acid on sat and I went insane. Then I took it again on thurs and went even more insane.
523	The day started off in Brooklyn, we were having fun, alot of people I knew. Abuot 15 in all. At least half of them were tripping, probably more. We walked around and smoked and the street started getting really cartoony.  Then the other group of people went off to smoked their blunt and we went to smoke ours. Even though were all friends they just wandered off. 
524	We smoked, and came back to my friends house. I was tripping nicely. We put on floyd. This would be one of my most insane experiances ever. After a while I was really getting into the floyd and they re-went out to smoke again. I opted to stay and listen to floyd in the warmth...... by myself. Big mistake/but crazy journey. After a while i was completely swallowed by the floyd and I was bugging, I never felt so aware or able to control reality. The walls were moving, the music was part of me and went exactly with it. 
525	Finally the CD ended. I was completely lost. I wasn't able to comprehend how the music could have stopped. I took out the cd and sat there feeling like a part of me had just been lost bugging out. I started to pace the room and talk to myself for 15 mins. Then I was I need the floyd and tried to get it to work again. I put the cd in and couldn't find the play buttong so i just started pushing all the buttons on the stereo. I couldn't get the damn thing to play. I was tripping balls. I started asking the cd to play itself, trying to cajole it into playing for me. Then I was like ok, Im tripping balls, But there are a limited amount of buttons, i can do this. After another 5 minutes of intense analysis and and examination, and attempting to comprehend my loss, I found the button and was like ahhhhh im back. Then everyone came back, but I wasn't sure if they existed or not. And i wasn't trusting myself to interact with them, I felt like I had been through this insane trip and couldn't possibly even relate to them. 
526	After a while of listening to them talk, (while I was still tripping) VOOSH, my whole environment changed, and they turned into weird things that were still breathing and talking but some where not human. Greg turned into a chameleon, Hunts was a Big stone human, these girls were sea creatures with flowing green hair, at that point people were trying to interact with me, and every now and then I wouild respond or give them the thumbs up to allay their fears. Then the other group came back and I was still tripping. The feeling I had been feeling before was soo intense I refused to let it go. Then Stew brought me back after a couple rounds of foosball, which he single handedly was owning me and Alex combined. L also helped to bring me back with his girlfriend by just talking to me and stuff. We went back to the room and I was stilll tripping. 
527	My hand all of a sudden got crazy i dont even know how to describe it except it started opening in a weird weird way. Like one finger would move in a tiny jerk which would be followed by another one and so on. But it took a while for it to open completely, I was still feeling crazy, people were looking at my hand going holy shit, he's gone insane. I dont remember most of the rest of the night, But eventually me and a couple of friends went on the train home. The train was soo trippy, whenever it would start slowing down it would make crazy tripped out noises like voosh coom wowr. I cant really type it, its like those crazy noises that synthesisers make when slowing down and speeding up. I got home at like 11:30 cz we took the cid mid day or early afternoon. I fell asleep at 6 in the morning. I was still feeling it a little throught the whole night.

530	For a while I had been wanting to trip because of all the stuff i heard about it. None of my friends liked tripping but i was not convinced. One a saturday night, my friend and i went to the Rocky Horror picture show, mainly because i wanted to sell some ecstacy i had. I ended up traded two rolls for a little baggie. In the baggie was supposevely acid. They looked like little purple insect legs. I do not remeber what they were called, but they said they were the cuttings left over from the sheet of gels or something. I was doubtful but trusting because it was my friend's boyfriend. We went out back and she put two of the bug-looking legs on my tongue. They tasted kinda strange. I let them dissolve and we went on with our night.
531	About 40 minutes later we decided to walk to the graveyard, but halfway there we decided to change our minds. As we walked back, i saw two cats and i pursued them. As i walked toward them, i heard a strange noise from the gutter. ( i later found out it was a frog croaking.) it scared the crap out of me and i ran off giggling insanely. i was convinced there was a monster in the gutter. the other girl that was with us began croaking and i began laughing in hysterics. By this time i knew it was kicking in.  They went back to get some ecstacy from someone while i wandered around. everything was strange and new. someone approached me wanting to buy a roll. but the strangest thing happened. i couldnt get it out of my wallet. everytime i opened my wallet, it was a confusion of colors and madness. i threw the wallet down on the ground. i couldnt understand why i couldnt get it out. luckily, my friend found the roll and my wallet. then we went n a car ride. 
532	i was by the window. looking out the window was the strangest thing that i had ever seen. the driver had put some trance on. when walked around on clematis for a while and by this time i was real messed up.  my mind was wandering. colors swirling in and out. tall buildings and trees were amazingly impressive. when we got back to rocky, we wrnt to the park ad i saw the most beautiful tree i had ever seen in my life. i decided to sit in it. by this time my friends were rolling and quite worried about me wandering off. We went back to rocky and actually went in the theater. what happened was amazing. the input to my brain was overwhelming. all the sounds, the sights, everything. then we went to IHOP. we went into the bathroom, and my pupils were quite large. i couldnt help staring at the stalls. they were the most beautiful shade of purple i had ever seen in my life.  strange rainbow patters, like a metal grid, covered everything. we got a ride home from the most beautiful guy i had ever seen in my life, and i was quite in love with him. when we got home it was about 4:30 AM. One of my friends who was rolling, had some shrooms. we then decided to go outside and explore. 
533	we decided to go to the community pool, but we never made it. everyfew steps or so, we would get distracted by something. then i noticed her face. it looked so strange. her eyes were morphing and her face just looked so weird. we were out side for an hour, wandering around. then we went inside and watched the Matrix. it was amazing. I was convinced the guy who wrote the script was tripping. It made perfect sense. After the movie was over, I was convinced i was in the matrix, I ran around screaming, 'there is no spoon!' i really was convinced. suddenly, i was ravenously hungry. i grabbed a sprite and ran into my friends room. 'orange.....AMBIVALENCE!' i said, and we all giggled. i didnt end up opening the can of sprite for about an hour.
534	afer that we sat on the floor for hours recalling all our memories. it was the most fun i had in my entire life and i would definately do it again. everything was so beautiful to me. it was the most amazing experience in my life and i believe i learned alot from it, just about how beautiful life is. 
535	unfortunately two days later i got extremely sick and vomited for two days straight, but that always happens to me when i try  a new drug. that will not prevent me from trying it again. it was totally different from what i expected, and anyone who wants to see the beauty in life should definately try it.

537	This is the story of my latest trip, which occured tonight and continues as I write this. I am 16 years old.
538	I went to a friend's house this evening at about five o'clock. There, I dropped three hits of white blotter that remained from 20 I'd bought a few weeks before. I went with two of my friends to a restaurant, where I drank water and had nothing to eat.
539	At around 6:30, I started getting the familiar queasiness in my stomach, but decided not to tell my friends yet. I went into the bathroom and looked at my pupils, and they were really big by this time. We wandered around a while, and they had a cigarette, before we decided to walk to our high school football game. We paid, went in, and sat down with some of my other friends. I immediately noticed the full moon, and the clouds that sometimes covered it.
540	Throughout the game, I would notice the moon and its position in the sky. I talked to my friends for a while, and they still did not know I was definitely feeling the acid. I talked to one of them about the fourth dimension, and how difficult it is to comprehend something like that, even though it must exist (for reference, look up 'Flatland' and read it...insane).
541	The moon, meanwhile, crawled across the sky, and it sometimes appeared as if someone had taken a huge eraser and smeared the moon's color across the black sky. By 8:30 or so, my friends knew I was tripping, because I said something about the huge dragon around the moon. We started discussing the Pillsbury Doughboy and how it would be funny if, instead of saying 'Whoo-hoo!' when you poked his stomach, he said 'Fuck you!' This conversation lasted until halftime, when the two friends I arrived with left (one has a curfew with his probation, and the other wanted to go home). I found a glowrod lying on the ground. I played with this and talked to some other people, and occasionally watched the game. The moon continued to creep and bleed across the sky, and shine its bright yellow light through the clouds.
542	At around 10 o'clock, I went with a different friend to the dance, because the game had ended. I took my trusty glowrod, and took off my shoes. In the gym, I talked to many people and continued to twirl the glowrod. Its mystical green light entranced me, and my friend decided it was time to leave. I had thought we had been there about five minutes, but it was actually more like 45. We left, got in the car, and cruised around looking for a party. I was content to sit and listen to selected tracks from Tool, Sublime, and some other groups I can't recall now.
543	We found a party: unfortunately, it sucked, so we left. I don't remember whether I even got out of the car or not, but we went to Wendy's and three of the five people got Frostys. We then drove back to the same party, and saw some people we knew, when some old guy told us we had to leave because we were blocking the cul-de-sac or something. Once more, we got into the car, and drove to one other place where a party was supposed to be. There was nothing there, so I was brought home at about 11:30. I talked to my mom for a while (which is always cool and scary at the same time), and then I watched some television. I had a Hotpocket and a Coke, which was the first thing I had eaten since about noon.
544	I am now sitting here writing this, and I enjoyed my evening thoroughly.

546	I first became interested in LSD when I accidently stumbled across an LSD article in the dentist's waiting room.  The article told briefly of the commonly experienced psychadelics of LSD.  I had never really given LSD a second thought in the past, but after cross-examining it I felt as if I was missing out on something.  I decided to start researching the drug and also contacted a few individuals that I knew had used LSD.  
547	I've always been a very careful person when in comes to foreign chemicals.  I would always research a drug thoroughly, seeking both users' and non-users' facts and opinions. After about 3 months of bi-daily research, I had decided I had read virtually every information-bearing LSD website I could find. Thus I decided I was informed enough to ensure safety and enjoyability in my experience.  I went about obtaining some LSD by contacting a friend that I knew had used it in the past, and we planned a trip.  My first LSD trip took place at his house, in which I ingested one sugar cube, and acheived somewhat of a trip.  I was extremely giddy, and the experience as a whole was extremely positive. Unfortunately, the more cosmic, psychadelic effects that I'd expected were absent.
548	The only hallucinations I experienced, besides the shadow of a branch that I saw as Medusa, were images I conciously manifested with my own imagination.  One of such images were a 'lizard man', a velociraptor with knee joints as humans, that was cloaked and squatting in the corner, flicking his tounge fiercly at me.  Once I manifested the image and it was in my vision, I felt an evil presence.  However, I quickly snapped out of this by reassuring myself that the drug had surely induced the vision. Even though I'd say that the hallucinations were enough to tell about, I didn't experience the complete alteration of time, space, matter, and thought that I hoped for.  I wondered if I didn't take enough LSD, and I presumed that perhaps I was more resistant to the drug than other people.  I decided on trying it again, this time from a different person and in a different form.   
549	I decided that the way I could acheive the trip I wanted was through more potent form of LSD.  Many people have told me their non-convincing experiences with paper-form LSD, and I decided I had to investigate for myself.  A few months after the first experience, I obtained 4 paper hits, and with my friend, took 2 each.  The effects were very familiar to the first trip.  Once again, I was giddy but no significant mild-alteration was present.  Just when I was ready to give up the quest for psychadelics my friend found another form.  He had met somebody, and he had obtained a few geltabs, thin squares of gelatin spotted with LSD.  I was given another hope.  We called another friend, and planned a trip.  It was to take place in some campgrounds we were to soon visit, a nice place with all the conveniences of the city (fresh water, heat, air condition) and all the wonders of nature.  It was surrounded by woods and a nice pond was nearby the house area.
550	When the time came, it was me and my two friends, D and F.  I chose not to use their names because I haven't informed them of my plans to document the trip.  We had 4 yellow geltabs, and decisively distributed them among us.  Since F had never done LSD before, he would take 1, and me and D would take 1 1/2 each, us having some LSD experience.  We decided to go inside and play cards while waiting for the wonders to come.  After about 30-45 minutes of cards, I began to feel the same effects as my first two trips.  I looked at the clock, thinking at least an hour had passed, but was wrong.  I was roughly 35 minutes into the trip, and already was lost in thought.  It was if every thought would start a chain reaction in my head, activating more and more thoughts to the point that I was pondering several very different topics at one time. About 1 hour into the trip, playing cards became extremely difficult, as I was being bombarded by abstract and fragmented thoughts and ideas.  With all that was going on in my head, the last thing I was thinking about were the cards in my hand.  Giving my hand to F, I decided to sit and try to calm my brainstorm restfully.  
551	I was only resting for about 10 seconds before I caught some movement in the corner of my eye.  I saw the ceiling moving, taking on a flowing form, as if it was silk being blown by the wind.  Being the first visuals I had ever experienced, I was awe-stricken.  I sat and watched the movement spread onto more surfaces, noticing that the movement was stronger whenever I looked. I could see movement in the corner of my eye, but only when I looked directly at something would it shift and dance. After staring at the floor for several minutes, I decided to return to my friends.  'D,' I said. 'Are you feeling anything?' He gave me a blank look and cracked a smile at me.  His pupils, almost completely dominating the blue of his eyes, were all I needed to see. 
552	It had only been a little over an hour, and we were all tripping.  We decided to take a walk outside, to see the newfound wonders of the surrounding area, despite the fact that it was around 10:00pm and very dark. We walked through a dimly lit path in the woods, and each tree we passed seemed characterized.  I felt as if I was walking among strangers, but an easy, relaxed feeling took over.  Despite the fact that I was walking into the dark woods, under the influence of a drug I had little grasp on, I didn't have an ounce of fear in me.  'Is it just me, or are these trees covered with a dark blue fog.' D said. I stopped and looked up at the treetops.  Among the almost pitch black treetops I saw beautiful patterns forming and changing, becoming more complex every second.  D was talking to me, but I didn't notice. I was awe-stricken.  
553	A tap on my shoulder got me out of the trance.  I turned around, and looked at D and F behind me.  It was extremely dark, and I tried to focus on their faces, but it was not their faces that I saw when I squinted at their extremely dimly lit heads.  As their faces came into view, they started taking on an evil, monster-like characteristic. I immediately thought back to reports I've previously read that described panic attacks upon seeing drug-induced and negative hallucinations. I told myself that it was impossible for them to be anything other than D and F, and despite what I saw I disregarded this and suggested we go back inside. We walked back inside, and upon arriving at the house I was overcome with another relaxing sensation.  I sat down on the couch, and was put into a  kind of a trance. 
554	As I sat and pondered the situation, one thought branched into a chain of thoughts, followed by another branch of thoughts, and was thrown into a series of mental visualizations that simply blew my mind. I had a similar experience after eating 225 Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds and smoking cannabis about 3 hours later, 2 after my stomach rejected the seeds.
555	'Lets go to the pond.' I suggested.  A quick walk through the woods would get us to our destination, a shining mirage of paradise in the moonlit night.  I visualized the pond. I saw the bright moon shining on the water, its sandy, beach-like shore (only on one side of the lake), and benches on the sand to relax on.  I smiled. 'Let's go.' We skipped over to D's care and extracted a few bowls of cannabis from his bag and headed blindly into the woods. We made our way through the woods, and upon doing this I noticed patterns on everything, and forming out of everything.  The leaves on the ground formed patterns, and the clouds in the sky formed patterns.  It was amazing.  I was busy staring at the pattern, and we got there quicker than I expected.  
556	I looked out at the lake, and sure enough, the moon lit up everything.  The reflection of the moon on the pond was shifting and moving. We walked over to a bench and sat down. D pulled out an 'irish' pipe and a bag of pot, and lit it accordingly. I took a couple of hits, and it wasn't until about 1 minute later that the peaking effects of the LSD returned in full effect.  I noticed the colors of the leaves on the ground melt together, the intense and rapid thought process returned. It took me by surprise, for part of the reason I wanted to smoke was that I suspected the LSD was wearing off.  I was mistaken however, because now I realize that they effects hadn't wore off at all, as if I was still on the trip's plateau.  I was only getting used to effects of the LSD... becoming accustommed to the moving surfaces and not thinking of it as abnormal.  I recognized how this could potentionally permanently damage my thinking process, and paid more attention to the psychadelia.
557	I stood there for a couple of minutes, trying to remember the sequence of events preceeding the present time.  It was then I remembered I had a few 'Sparklers' in my pocket.  Sparklers are fireworks... you light the end of the long metal stick and sparks spew out of it for about 1 minute.  I pulled a Sparkler out, and lit it.  It took a few seconds to light, but once lit immediately exploded into a rage of sparks intensified by my hallucinations.  As I moved it around my vision, tracers followed it in a very flowy motion, and the path of the sparkler in my vision was revealed until the sparkler went out.  When it went out, my heart was racing.  I was amazed.  I turned around and looked at D and F, who were also left silent by the beautiful display of colors.  I lit a few more, and we smoked another bowl before heading back inside.
558	The walk back was similar to the other treks through the dark woods. Everything I could see was a part of a beautiful pattern. D and F also saw patterns. Upon returning to the house, we all agreed that 4:00am was a reasonable time to go to sleep.  We went to bed, and though I'm still unsure whether they managed to go to sleep, I was in a complete state of insomnia.  I laid in bed for an hour or so before the effects of the pot took its toll on me and I passed out.
559	I hope this report shines some light on the LSD experience, as reports submitted before mine helped me to better understand something I had no knowledge of. I believe that knowledge and preparedness are essential when it comes to hallicunagenic experimentation.

562	I thought I'd like to share this experiance as it was so clear and amazingly real.
563	A beautiful still fullmoon night, myself and friend Marty planned to take a little of some recently aquired LSD. We had been told it was very clean and fresh.
564	I road my pushbike to M's house at dusk and watched the huge moon rise over suburban Melbourne. We had decided to take the acid and then rehearse a few songs until it came on. It didn't take long before my hands became disengaged from my mind and magical vistas began to appear behind my eyes. The rehearsal was over.
565	We retired to the lounge room for a beer and a smoke. I was feeling wonderful as we sat chatting about state of the world. We seemed to be in some mutal blissed 'love's the answer, love's the question' headspace. M talked his brother's suicide, and showed emotions I had never seen in him before. While this conversion was going on I noticed distortions in his face, I had seen these before when we had tripped on previous occasions and I always looked away as I thought it was some sort of sickness. But this time I concentrated on his face as his nose and chin grew into a gargoyle-like mask.
566	As we continued to talk this mask took on even more hidious looking features (classic gargoyle and ghoul archtypes)until it reach the point where it was nearly impossible to look at. M's face was at a profile to me but these other ghoulish faces continued to look at me from out of the side of his head. Then he turned to face me and his eyes and the eyes of these hideous gargoyles became one. I was staring directly into his eyes and then room exploded into green and all I could see were his eyes in a thick green fog. I remember thinking then that his eyes were the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.
567	Then the green mist cleared and M had turned into a leprechaun and was lying in a field of mushroons. He was about 3 feet long with a long wispy red beard, large pointy ears, a little green hat, green suit and pointy shoes with buckles. Here I was sitting in the room with a beer talking with a leprechaun as real as the day was long. Then he began changing again first into a camouflaged, pointy eared earth warrior and then a parade of what was literally thousands of faces, pirates with eye patches, old black women and everything else in between. During this whole time we continued rapping.
568	It was a truely magical trip and we gently came down over a few beers and joints. I felt truly privileged to have seen what I believe was my friends spirit. I had never beleived that I would ever in this life see a leprechaun, now I know one who lives just down the road.
569	Thanks for opportunity to tell my little story.

571	My girlfriend and I elected to have our own little New Years 2K party by tripping our brains out in a nearby hotel. We succeeded, using a total of six hits of acid, splitting them between us. 
572	I had tripped a few times, but all at lower dosages (one or two hits), so was pretty prepared for an interesting experience. We downed one hit, with 1000mg of Vitamin C (I still don't know if it more greatly potentiates an experience, but it seemed to help.), waited one hour, and then downed hit #2, with another 1000mg of Vit. C. During this time, we had turned off all the lights in the room, lit a number of candles (most in hurricane glass - highly recommended) and relaxed.
573	About an hour later, we were feeling the first two hits, VERY speedy, but OK.. and elected to imbibe the third hit, too. This particular batch of LSD-25 seemed to hit after about two hours, peak after about 4, and fade around 9 hours.
574	We were already having very trippy psycholitic [sic] reactions (breathing ceiling, weird stucco, 3-D effects from the wallpaper edging, aural distortions from the Enigma and Deep Forest we were listening to), and proceeded to have delightful but not overly ecstatic sex. :) 
575	Time passed, first watching VERY awful but amusing porn on the hotel Spanktrovision, then with her painting watercolors and me waxing philosophically. The third hit was coming along well, and, after she showered, I was feeling frisky, so we had sex again.
576	Oh my god. :) We had complete ego dissolution, and the best sex I've ever had. I came five times, something I hadn't expected was even physiologically possible. She was getting fantastic synesthesia, seeing splashes of color with every touch and caress, while I was in the midst of watching our loveplay sort of in slow motion, floating between being in my body, and loving her, and climaxing, and floating back out of myself while we continued to make love very swiftly and ecstatically.
577	There was a lot of teeth clenching and a fair amount of paranoia (on my part), but the latter is normal for me with more than one hit. Teeth clenching seemed most treatable using 'Mixed Fruit MENTOS' -- but they taste awful. 'You think you want one, and you put the Mentos in your mouth, but by then, the Mentos has used you for its' purposes.' But they crunch well. I had massive synesthesia on one, with sounds happening, instead of tasting the Mentos 'goodness'. (yecch) 
578	Star Trek: The Next Generation 'The Best of Both Worlds' was on, and I mused how cheesy the Borg costumes were -- but still kind of spooky. I mused 'That must be when they know to stop spending money on effects. 'Don't spend more, sir -- it's good enough to fool the acidheads.'' 
579	There were some setting issues, due to a recent death in her family, but I was feeling very empathic, and we talked, and cried, and it was a very wonderful, bonding, and flat out fun experience. Sleep was VERY hard to obtain, even 17 hours after the first hit, but it finally came. 
580	Now if only LSD weren't so hard to come by here lately :)

583	  I never used to have dreams until I started using LSD.  It's been about a month since I first tripped and have done it a few more time since.  EVERY single night when I go to bed, I've had a very memorable, vivid dream.  I  love it.  I even look forward to going to bed because I know I'll visit some entirely new world when I'm sleeping.  None of the dreams are nightmares either.

585	I have done acid before, but never this much. Actually, the last time i dropped i only did 2 hits and this time i dropped 5 hits, which is a huge step up.
586	0:20 - get a slight body high and lights seem to get brighter than normal
587	1:00 - everything has become very distorted, there are patterns all over whatever i look at
588	1:30 - here comes the peak, having a conversation is simply impossible, the concept of a phone completely escapes me, time has dwindled to almost non-existence, and the patterns are even stronger and i have some long ass trails. i don't even have to unfocus my eyes
589	2:00 - it feels like i am in a movie, out-of-body type feelings, and the feeling that anything i do right now doesn't matter, i can not hear anything except for what is in the room and what i do hear is accompanied by echos, or when my friends try to talk they sound almost like computers
590	2:30 - my senses are being completely switched around, like if my hearing is gone i would be able to feel what my girlfriend is saying or see it.  And the times that i can see the patterns and trails are even stronger
591	6:00 - the effects start to wear off but i don't come all the way down until 10 the next morning, and all day today my brain has felt completely fried. but overall, i had a wonderful time and it didn't feel like a bad trip at any time.  i personally thought it was better than rolling, which most people wouldn't agree with but then again, i am a little weird.

593	After reading on the internet and talking to people who've done it before, my girlfriend and I decided to trip for the first time.  We picked up 2 hits of blotter for free because I ran a couple errands for the kid I was supposed to buy it from.  So, we went back to her house and ate some McDonald's and ingested the paper.  About 20 minutes in, it began to feel like we got ripped off, so we smoked a bowl and began to watch 'The Green Mile.'  About 1 hour into the experience I began to feel very, very anxious about something, but I couldn't figure out what it was.  Everything seemed weird, out of the ordinary.  So, we continued to watch the movie and I caught my first visual in the part where the black prisoner coughed up the bee/wasp things.  It looked like they came right out of the TV and flew past me.  It was quite cool.  I also noticed that the color on the TV, mainly people's skin, was extremely bright, glowing even.  After that it seemed like I stopped tripping until about three hours later, when a friend came over.  He saw the size of my pupils and decided to play with my head for a little bit.  He kept lighting a lighter by his face, and it was extremely amusing.  Then he tried to make it look like he was going to kick me.  He was across the room and I swear I thought he was going to hit me right in the face.  I freaked out and started jumping around covering myself screaming!  When I realized what I was doing, I found it extremely hilarious and cracked up.  I laughed so hard that tears were streaming down my face.  After I calmed down, I got kinda hungry.  I was leaving at 10:30 and it was 9:00, so I wanted something quick and easy.  I don't remember how it happened, but somehow we ended up making spaghetti.  After I ate, my mom came and got me and I went home and just slept.  I remember I couldn't concentrate on one thought the whole night.  I felt if I did I would go insane.  I also couldn't keep my fingers out of my mouth.  
594	Overall, I wouldn't say that the experience was a waste, or a disappointment, but it wasn't what I was hoping for.  Still, really cool.  I loved it. I plan to try it again in about 2 weeks with a stronger dose.  I'll do a follow up on it.  Maybe I'll even do a comparison.

596	Endogenous (86), LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
597	Well, this experience wasn't the first time I'd experimented with psychedelic drugs by any means. In fact, the weekend before this particular Saturday, I had eaten a tab on Friday and a tab on Sunday. I had gotten the acid that weekend from someone I ran into completely through random dumb luck, and on the spur of the moment I bought 10 hits. I have very different standards of self-control than most people and that actually made Tom, my sidekick and friend, very nervous about my mental/physical health. He was opposed to doing the LSD and told me that on Friday.
598	When I woke up on Saturday I was expecting a fairly boring day. Tom had slept on my floor and at 11:30am when I finally woke up and kicked him awake, we set out for coffee. Over coffee and cigarettes we decided that we wouldn't do the acid, we'd save it for later when we'd appreciate it more. He had tripped with me last Friday (not Sunday tho, that was all by myself) and thought it better to wait. Besides, we had plans to go see a few bands in downtown Boston that day at 9pm and we could easily kill 8 hours with grass. 
599	When we got back to my house, however, we found we had a situation on our hands. I still live at home at the age of 19 (taking computer programming classes - my brain isn't rotted quite yet) and I'm pretty absent-minded, and this time I had forgotten my keys. Worse yet, no one was home and we were locked out. So of course, we ended up eating a tab of acid and heading out into the huge park across the street from my house.
600	We wandered around the park for a while with nothing exciting to report. We smoked a joint and waited and walked. We left the park and headed for the huge graveyard which is also pretty much right next to my house. At this point, the acid was having subtle effects on me. The grass of the graveyard was greener, the sky was bluer, the sun was brighter. This is something that usually happens to me under psychedelics at first and I was used to it. I was also not too taken aback when we passed three or four signs that said 'WATER' very strangely, or so it seemed. The letters were white, on a green background. The font that was used for the sign seemed to have millions of imperfections that I was only then able to pick up because of the drug. The sign seemed to stand out to me, as if WATER was something I should remember and think about. 
601	As if reading my mind, Tom suggested we go buy something to drink from the store. 'Why not?' I thought. At this point the LSD wasn't doing very much and I figured that this was a good time to test myself in public. I asked Tom if he was tripping yet, because it had been over an hour now. He wasn't really. Right about then, Tom suggested we eat another tab. I had to agree with him. We decided tripping was worth doing, so it must be done right. We went back to my house (my parents had gotten home), ate the tab, and headed off to the store.
602	We decided to smoke another bowl to set us off. We headed towards the baseball diamond, past it, and into a part of the park where people tend not to go, through a hole in a fence, and we were on a high cliff overlooking an authentic train yard. We smoked a bowl and walked along the cliff, and nothing was happening. We left the fence and I got my first real hit from the acid. We were standing on a hill next to the fence overlooking the baseball field and suddenly the green grass and the brown dirt of the baseball field all seemed to be bleeding into each other. The baseball diamond had grass seeping onto it and the sand from the baseball diamond was mingling with the outer reaches of the grass. The metal backstop was gleaming and glittering and hard to focus on. 
603	I looked at Tom. That was a horrible idea. One of the oddest things about my trip was that during the entire time, whenever I looked at my companion, I would see his face in about 10 different perspectives all flashing and changing very rapidly. I had to strain to figure out what kind of looks he was giving me. It was very odd. I'm used to looking at people and seeing strange things when under the effects of drugs, but this time it was just a bit too real. I couldn't see people for what they were during the trip. Children passing me by or playing in the playground all resembled aliens from some Spielberg movie. Most of the adults I dealt with that day looked normal, but they had an aura of evil around them that only I seemed able to grasp.
604	Had I done too much? How could I really be sure? Four tabs in under two weeks? Was that an excess? Now, it doesn't seem like such a strange thing, but at the time, the thought was running through my head like a marathon runner. It was everywhere in my mind. When I tried to think of something else, it worked its way back into my head, like a virus. 
605	The visual hallucinations had started early and I felt robbed of the laughing hysteria phase that usually overtook me. In place of that, I found myself on a rambling kick. I'd start talking and keep talking and then I'd look over at Tom and he'd be staring at me. I explained to him that my inner conversings had come out to play. He seemed to accept this answer and I was glad about that. One less thing to worry about, but Tom was worried. He was rightly worried, because less than 10 minutes later we passed a mother and a kid on a bicycle and suddenly I starting jabbering about being a kid and all my childhood memories from this very same park. After we got out of earshot, Tom made fun of me for a while about scaring the lady and the kid. I hope I didn't scare them too much. 
606	About this time, the trip was coming on full power. I felt a rush all around me. The world outside of my line of perception seemed to me to be very much irrelevant, and the only thing that mattered was right there in that park. Beforehand I was worried that I would start obsessing over my personal girl problems. I soon learned that those thoughts melted away, and I couldn't have been happier.
607	Time was also very distorted. Neither of us had a watch nor any way to keep track of what time it was. We had to go back to my house at some point to prepare ourselves to get on the train (we decided not to drive; multiple felons maybe, but responsible people). At what must have been 4:00, we had a huge discussion over what time it was. We were sure that it was nearly 7 and we had to go back soon to get ready for the show. We smoked a bowl and headed back to my house. Well, it turned out that it was 4:30 when we got back (meaning we smoked up at 4:20 - very cool, very cool; we can never make 4:20 unless it's accidental for some reason). After we realized it was early still, we headed back, but the entire rest of the day, time kept doing odd things to us. 
608	We decided to go back to the store, because we had smoked all of our cigarettes (we went on chain-smoking mode once the trip started) and we wanted to buy some candy to eat as an experiment. I found, however, that being in the store was more then I was prepared to deal with, so I told Tom I'd be waiting outside, gave him money to buy me cigarettes, then went outside and smoked the only cigarette I had left from before. Once I was alone and outside, the world changed gears. It went from being extremely small and centered around me to being very large. I suddenly became aware of every single person who walked by me and what they were doing. Then they all seemed to be looking at me. I decided it was all in my head - all paranoid delusions. I tried to find Tom in the store window, and I succeeded. I watched him pay for the gummi worms (our testing material) and cigarettes, and noticed how he avoided looking at and talking to the clerk. I found it very amusing apparently, because I started laughing hysterically. At that point my brain reminded me I was all alone outside and I said, very loudly, 'Oh shit...', turned around, and saw some guy legitimately staring at me.
609	Bad vibes overcame me, but they were soon gone. Tom got out of the store and tossed me a bag of gummi worms and a pack of cigarettes. Bliss. Usually when tripping I find eating is generally out of the question. When I think I'm hungry, I get a ton of food but then I can't eat it, or something goes horribly wrong in the process of getting food. No matter. Gummi worms aren't exactly food, more like fun, weird, strange globs of chemicals not entirely unlike the ones I had in me causing all these effects in my brain. The gummi worms were great. I puzzled over their movement, their taste and texture, and had a very long conversation about it. 
610	The store is across the street from the park on the other end of the park from my house, so we went back into the park and sat at the end in an area that was circular with benches around it. In the middle of the circle was a tree with a fence around it. We each sat on our own bench and stared at the tree in the fence. Suddenly, in my brain Tom was gone. He was out of sight and out of mind. I checked my limbs for a status report but I couldn't really control them that well, so I gave up. I started to hear my heart pounding loudly and then the tree started to seemingly dance. It was skinny, small, and without leaves. It was twirling and rippling and the fence surrounding it was bobbing up and down. The rush I spoke of earlier intensified. Suddenly, there were church bells. The church bells played a strange, enchanting sound. I can't be too sure how long I sat there watching the tree and fence, listening to the church bells in my own little world. Suddenly, though, I realized Tom was sitting on the next bench over. I had actually completely forgotten about him, but I didn't want to break up what was happening. In my mind I explained it as a pure trip, that is, what was happening to me right then at that exact moment was everything that acid should have been. Of course, this was probably just the drugs speaking, but it sure felt that way. The combination of sight, sound, and taste sensations had overwhelmed me with goodness and I was lost. I wondered to myself if Tom was experiencing the same things, but he looked bored when I finally looked over at him. I made a really quick attempt at explaining it to him, but it didn't work at all.
611	Anyway, eventually 8pm did come and we had to leave for the show (after smoking some more pot). At this point I was still tripping, not as hard as earlier, but the acid was taking its toll. All the people on the train seemed to be detached from me and Tom, and they also seemed to be staring at us. More paranoid delusions. I had a quote of HST's running through my head all during the train ride, trying to keep myself grounded:  'ignore this terrible drug.' Unfortunately, it wasn't that easy. Everyone I looked at had big, buggly eyes and was leering at me. I had decided that they all knew there was something wrong with me. I could pass it off as being drunk tho, and that's not that bad for 8pm on a Saturday evening. 
612	We got to our desired T stop at 8:30 and that left us half an hour to kill. We wandered around with no particular direction, half strung out and half still tripping. Now, Boston is not a town for psychedelic drugs by any means, but I've survived peaking in Boston so there wasn't much in the town that could throw me off, or so I thought, but instead, out of the blue, two people offered to sell Tom and me two different drugs (one was e, and the other was called 'charley,' which I think is heroin but I can't be too sure). That got me extremely paranoid and anxious about going to this club, because i have spent a lot of my life in Boston and I find it incredibly hard to find anything around here. Odd. 
613	But, by the time doors opened and we got in, the acid was pretty much completely gone and the dope had worn off long ago. I had a slight headache from dehydration but I danced my ass off anyway. All in all, a fun day and a great trip, maybe the most intense I'll ever have. I got home and passed out first thing. Woke up and went to work for some overtime to pay my way through next weekend.

615	I am an old head. I have not taken large volumes of LSD, as it's potency seems to revolve around your potency. It is the only drug that is impossible to abuse. Respected, it can be dreadfully strong. It operates on your system primarily as a sensory amplifier, when potent, to the point of distortion. 
616	As a professional musician, I can say that it's Inspirational,but to be respected. When used as a tool to gain advantage over booze and other situations, it is at best extra legs. Over-use leads to depression. The power to trip is in you: LSD is only the catalyst. While you are young, you can dig it the most, it uses up the vitamins and enzymes in your system, which are replaced by time and nutrition. Have respect. Do you see God?.....Of course!!!!!! By opening your eyes wide and gaining empathy with His creation! Do you become God???// No way.  
617	You must repent. It is not wrong to experience LSD, it is a privledge, and a joy. How can you get tied up in an experience that is only temporary.? By taking what you've learned to the test. That's Life. Love, Stephen

619	I have used LSD 27 times so far this year, I only started this year.
620	Here were I live LSD is very expensive and sometimes you don't even get your trips, the dealers steal all our cash, So sometimes I would get a half but not less! Well It seems that every time I trip out something stays with me I don't have hectic flashbacks but strange visions eg: I have a permanet trail shadow following my hands when I move them around and at night all the shadows in my room moves like ghosts! 
621	Its not really freaky but I think thats what LSD is suppose to do 'FREAK YOU OUT' anyways when I drink coffee the effect is worse and the longer I go without tripping the worse it gets. So when I take a Trip the effects are gone for about a week , but the hands still makes trails! This all started happening after about 6 trips! They were manily SUN FLOWERS, HOFFMAN'S & MARILYN MONROE's!

624	        Wow, first acid trip in 8 months. This dude I know from on the
625	Internet sent me two hits of Red Sun acid, and I took them both. It hit me
626	fast, in about a half hour, and it hit me hard. I played guitar and talked
627	        It was an interesting trip. It hit me a little around midnight of
628	the 20th. I took a hit of pot right at midnight to celebrate the first
629	minute of the first day of spring, and that kicked in the acid. Around
630	1:45 things were real intense so I decided to get off the computer and go
631	lay down in bed. The near-full moon was very bright and shining in my
632	window, with clouds swirling unnaturally fast around it. The bars of my
633	window frame were flickering around, and the still bare tree branches
634	outside were dancing wit their own life. It was very visual, and too
635	intense to look at for long, so I pulled down the shade and closed my
636	eyes, and went to that inner, chaotic, cut and paste universe of vivid
637	imagery that I hadn't been to in years. Cartoony voices seemed to be
638	saying nonsense words from every direction as I floated there in
639	hyperspace, saying things like 'Zlerty-zot meep awwww znew' or 'Sbpack
640	Sbpack.' After a while, the chaos organized somewhat, becoming a jumbled
641	collection of imagery and themes that seemed to come from Jewish culture.
642	Flash to images of a baby in a crip, this feels something like a memory.
643	This gives way to images of people I know now, only I see them as they
644	would have been as small children. Eventually things spiral down to more
645	coherent imagery, and I lay in bed thinking about life until around 4:30
646	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
647	 I was 17 at the time and I remember getting back from school and calling up one of my boys and asking what was up for the night.  It was a friday. He told me that he could hook up some acid, so I said let's try it. So me and my twin brother went to his canton 20 minutes later and he already hooked up 10 tabs for 25 bones, so we gave him our share and we all took 3 tabs each. He saved 1 for the next day.
648	I drank a big cup of orange juice to help kick in the effects (I don't know if that really works) and waited. Twenty-five minutes went by and I didn't feel a thing. I thought we got ripped off and my homie says, 'He said this shit was potent.' And I said, 'Man, we took 3 doses and I ain't feeling shit.' Five minutes went by and I realized how wrong I was. This shit had me on a 14 hour trip. In the peak I saw everything in a glittery glow and everything I looked at began to melt. My bro and T said they felt it too. They said they saw tracers and my brother said that he felt like he was melting. It was insane.
649	Anyway, I was listening to my walkman and I go outside of my homie's pad. It was already getting dark, but then I started to notice that everything began to move with the rhythm of the music (I was listening to some Jimi Hendrix). It was so intense how the timing was just exact, it would slow down then pick up pace. The sounds I heard in the music resembled life, it was like reality was represented by the music and I could feel myself floating. I let my eyes go out of focus and then I saw hundreds of little pictures of me right in front of my eyes, like I was staring at myself from behind while I was looking into a mirror. I looked to the sky and I saw the stars forming geometric shapes. I have never had an LSD trip like this before, this was something else.
650	I saw a cat calling for me and I looked into its eyes and realized that I began to communicate with it. I really understood what it wanted. I think it was a stray cat and it seemed to be lonely. I could see what it was thinking, and it undersood how I felt. Let me tell you, I'm not a cat person, but I started to pet it and it felt grateful for my company. All of a sudden it sounded like it was whispering words to me. Though I couldn't understand what it was saying, I felt it was speaking truths. My bro and T were just sittin' there on the couch just tripping, laughing at everything, man. But I saw this and it seemed as though I knew why it was like this and I couldn't explain it. I could still hear the cat then I said, 'Farewell, little guy and good luck.' I went back into the room and tried to tell these guys what was happening, but they were laughing too much, so I couldn't blame them.
651	I sat on the couch and listened to my walkman. I felt like I was in the music. I couldn't see myself anymore, I could just hear the music all around me. Then I closed my eyes and opened them to what seemed to be a universe and all this time I could hear music playing in the backround. I lost track of time and it seemed like an eternity, but when I closed my eyes and opened them again, I was in my neighborhood walking and it was daytime. This all on the kraziest 14 hour acid trip of my life. I tell you, this really was something else. Almost like a dream in reality.

653	When i turned nineteen (summer of 98) i was a heavy acid user.  i had just found out that i had impregnated  my ex-girlfriend and was somewhat of an alcoholic loser.  However, we were getting really good lsd mailed from out west, and i was eating a fair bit of it.  over the course of the year i ate it about every weekend, usually 3-8 hits.  i would constantly feel someone hovering over my shoulder and whispering something in my ear.  i couldn't tell who it was but knew it was a girl. this happened approximately 5-7 times over the course of the year.  
654	the following summer me and my friend got drunk and decided to injest 30-40 drops each.  it was scary but interesting.  the same thing happened but this time i realized that it was my ex-girlfriend because i could see, feel, hear and smell her. i had gone to visit our child that day for only the second time in 3-4 months. within two weeks i cut my hair, got a job, and started working on getting my girlfriend back.  
655	two long months later we were back together, but the coolest part was about three months after that.  When we had just finished making love on a
656	january night she whispered the same thing i had heard those many lsd-induced times before.  we have been together ever since.

658	LSD (2) : General (1), Mystical Experiences (9), Unknown Context (20)
659	It was a friday night and after my friend and I had gotten back home, we decided to trip.  Well, actually we had decided to two days ago, but that was just the point-of-no-return per se.  Anyway, I had 3 hits in my posession.  1 white blotter with a star on it, and two sweet tarts that had had liquid lsd dripped onto them.  Around 12 I took the white blotter and my friend took one sweet tart.  We waited, and waited, and waited for what seemed like forever.  
660	My friend mentioned that he was hungry and so we decided to get some midnight snacks.  We went into my kitchen and made some popcorn and sandwiches.  For some odd reason i started staring at the popcorn and when i realized that i had been staring at the popcorn for some time, i realized that my friend was not in the kitchen anymore.  So, out of fear that my parents or younger sibling would discover him tripping balls, I started whispering out his name, and after what seemed like an eternity of searching i found him standing in front of a mirror in my entry-hall and all he said was look at the mirror.  Now this is probably my only regret of the night, however, I have grown from this mistake and I am sure that it is only specific to me, but I decided to look in the mirror.  It was AMAZING, my face suddenly became nothing and then was immediately an 'aliens' head (those grey ones that are commonly depicted on TV).  This scared the crap out of me.  So my friend and I decided it would be best to go back into my room.  
661	I felt extrememly uneasy and anxious almost paranoid.  I decided to get on IRC and talk to some 'experts' I knew.  As indicated by a so-called 'expert' i started watching Tom and Jerry.  My friend started laughing his balls off, while I could only think of how bad it must be to be the little mouse helpless to such a predator as a large cat.  However, again this i believe is only specific to me and furthermore sprouted from an incident that occurred only a month before.  Anyway i felt that what i needed to do was just lay down and relax and listen to some music.  So I got in my bed and realized that it would all be over soon and that i should just enjoy it while i could. So I just relaxed and listened to some Bob Marley and closed my eyes and looked at all the patterns and amazing visuals that I was seeing.  There were so many that I cannot remember them all, however, there are two that stuck out in my mind.  One occurred after my friend had insisted on turning out the lights and turning off the TV.  I was staring at my wall and noticed how it looked almost like liquid, so I decided to touch it and when I did, it rippled and some of the 'liquid' came off on my hand and quickly started engulfing my entire hand, I loved this, it was right out of the matrix.  Another wonderful visual that I experienced was when I suddenly felt this urge to stare at my fingers.  My index and middle finger suddenly turned into cartoon baby blue-jay's. 
662	Contradictions and Additional Notes:  I forgot to mention that around 12:45 after feeling no significant effect, i took the third sweet-tart.  And also, my 'friend' who I was with insisted on turning out the lights and TV, which pissed me off, but because of the fear of inducing a 'bad trip' i didn't argue.

664	I was 18 the first time I experienced what would forever change my life.  My friend had done acid before, and I was intrigued with how a small piece of paper could cause some of the things she described.  She led me on my first trip...
665	We were walking from a neighbor's apartment to our apartment, which was only a few yards when the effects started to occur.  It seemed like it took days to walk the short distance.  The hairs on my arms began to stand up...the air felt light...I felt like I was gliding along...noticing things I had never noticed before.  Lights had multiple colors, not just the white color I had only seen before.  The wind made the most incredible, exciting sounds through the trees.  Words are insufficient to describe the experience.  I felt I was in touch with the universe...like I was one with my friend...we could read each other's thoughts.  Life made absolute sense.
666	I have described it to people by saying that the 'walls in my mind were torn down.'  I have never since seen life the same as before the first experience.  There is more reality now, be it good or bad, REALITY.  It is this continued perception that makes me believe one never comes down after doing acid.

669	The second time I tripped, it was with my friend, and boyfriend at the time; we'll call him J. It was way more intense than the first time, but I felt worse after I came down. We got the acid from another friend and took it at her house at about 8pm. J and I were with a third friend, W, who wasn't on anything that night. We were driving out to J's house and we picked up some fast food on the way and ate in an empty parking lot near J's house. While they were eating I started feeling the acid. I felt tingly all over, and then it felt like when your foot falls asleep, but all over my body. J and W walked around the parking lot smoking a cigarette and I stayed in the car because I was cold. I was looking at the car seat and it looked like it was breathing, very gently. 
670	Then we went to J's house, and talked to his parents and grandmother for a while. I was really feeling it by then. I felt detached and kind of unfocused or tranced out. We went outside and we were leaning against the above-ground pool. Water looks really awesome when you're tripping. I was leaning against J and we were entranced by the stars. The clouds appeared to be coming in closer and closer. J was trying to explain it to W and we waved his lit cigarette across the sky. J and I both saw it leave a bright trail and we were like, 'Whoa!!!' W just said, 'Okaaaay...' (He's been with me both times I tripped; he finds it hilarious to watch people on acid.) We went inside and were watching Outbreak  on one of the fifty billion movie channels. The sick people looked really disgusting. 
671	Then we went outside; it was December so it was pretty cold. J and I smoked a joint and we were just having fun being fucked-up dorks. W was having fun watching us be fucked-up dorks. Me and J spent a lot of time looking at the sky; we both saw a cloud that looked like a man's face moving around. At one point I was holding the joint and the wind blew smoke into my eyes. Everything look beautiful and swirly for a second. It was just a screen of white opalescent smoke. J, who doesn't exactly live in the best part of town (he calls it the ghetto but it's not too bad) was telling us about all the neighbors that went past. Then we saw a dog across the street. J went over and started barking at it. It barked back once, J barked back louder and ran toward it, and the dog hauled ass down the street. It was really funny. We went back inside, and by then I felt like I was just drifting through everything we did. 
672	All of a sudden, all my thoughts, everything just made perfect sense. Everything seemed so right, and I was thinking that this was how it should always be. J was holding his baby niece for what seemed like a long time, but my sense of time was way distorted, anyway he and the baby just looked so content and peaceful. That added to my thoughts of how right everything was. W and I had to leave soon after that (we're still in high school, we had a lame curfew). On the way home, my sense of time got even more out of whack. The clock would say, like, 11:30 or something, for what felt like ten minutes. Then I'd look back what I thought was 2 minutes later and it'd be 20 minutes later. Before the tripping started, J and I told W to let us listen to 'It's On' by Korn when we started tripping. So me and W listened to it on the way home. It was awesome. If you've never heard it, it had kind of weird, fluctuating noises at the beginning. 
673	I was at my dad's house for the weekend, and of course I didn't want him to know I was tripping, so I was trying to avoid him as much as possible. I wanted to go to bed because I hadn't peaked yet and I was afraid I'd act too weird in front of him. There was a towel on a rack in the bathroom that look like it was contacting in and out like an accordion. My dad asked where all we'd gone, and for a second I completely blanked out until I remembered we were at J's. I told him i was tired  so I as going to bed, but he was in a talkative mood. I was beginning to have visual hallucinations so I finally locked myself in my room for the night. The walls were moving. My dork little sister had hung pine tree garland things all over in honor of Christmas, and I swore they were breathing. There were also foil garlands that looked like liquid that was dancing. It was cool. 
674	Then I noticed the ceiling. It's wood so you could see the grain and where the paint is peeling, and the patterns it formed were moving all over, like a flat lava lamp. I watched the ceiling most of the night. At one point the design changed to bugs and scorpions but I didn't freak like I thought I would have. The bed was the softest I've ever been in. I was floating. My deep thoughts returned; over anf over in my head was a mantra of 'Everything is now.' I was thinking that we spend way too much time obsessing over the past and future, and we should just chill and ejoy everything now. I finally got to sleep for an hour at 7am. It was a better trip than my first, because I didn't see things that much the first time. But next time, I'll probably do it during the day. 
675	This was the day before semester exams and I need sleep! Since then I've kind of kept in mind the 'revelations' I had; I quit worrying so much about what I could have changed of the past and I don't freak about the future, I just kind of go with the flow. Which isn't a bad idea, I found. See, drugs are good for some things!

677	So there's this thing that came through my town called the Omegafest and my friend buys several bottles of the pure liquid that allegedly starts the national chain of illicit lysergic acid.
678	This stuff is so strong and pure that I fill a by-then almost empty food-coloring bottle with tap water and swish and gulp... Blugh! I've never really tasted acid to such an immeasurable degree, and I soon discover that despite my self-proclaimed guru status I have never dosed like this before.
679	So we're (my friend and I) winding back to our origin of consciousness and we're discussing trip stuff. After awhile I realize that my consciousness is completely delocalized and quantum reality is surging through my brain. I have to think really, really hard to figure out what room I am in and by midnight I have forgotten everything that I had done earlier that day.
680	This is where it gets weird... I come to discover that me and my friend are of the same genetically evolved species, except I'm the active component and he's the passive component. He had mastered the trip from the past up the the present and I knew the trip from the present into the future. Anyways we finally succeed in smoking pot and I am suddenly absorbed in what I swore was post-terrestrial existence.
681	Everything I saw moved in ray-traced slow motion and all light appeared to be pixellized. This is where the missing moment begins. We are walking in perfect circles in his apartment living room speaking back and forth to each other without thinking about it at all, utilizing the vehicle of our heightened consciousness to communicate. Then, I bump into a chair and it fucks with my orbit. I obliviously pick the chair up and heave it as if it was the oppressive force I've experienced my entire subjective existence... right through a gigantic sliding glass door.
682	My friend looks at me astonished, but I assuage his anxiety by proclaiming 'Hey man! It doesn't matter anymore! We're creating everything we perceive with our minds and now you and I are going to infuse our thoughts and make the universe contract into the big stop! Finally! We're god now!'
683	How incredibly naive. We proceeded to break a lot of other things in his home, spit on the walls, pour beer everywhere, unleash gigantic bags of tea into the air, and cover all of the walls with psychotic gibberish in crayon. Actually, I only broke the glass door with the chair and my friend did all of the other stuff while I lay in the bottom of his shower... water blasting, curled up naked in a fetal position sucking my thumb. A baby once again...
684	My subjective cognitive reference point had completely vanished and I was thrown back into infinity... Simultaneously existing in a 3d shell with my mind expanded into the entirety of the fouth dimension. Mentally dead but physically alive. I was still waiting for us to somehow shed our old skins and enter 'thought-world' but I started coming down instead.
685	I realized that I was not, in fact, existing in a place made by my thoughts so that I could unify all things into one, but that I had just tripped harder than I've ever tripped on LSD and that now I would have to pay for the shit I broke. Kinda bummed me out that I had tripped once again only to put more polish on the paradigm and not to cross myself over into a greater form, whatever that might have been.

687	LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
688	This was one fo my first experiences with the drug and by far one of my fondest, if only for the variation in moods and thoughts and how I was able to cope.
689	The incident happened in 1993 at a MegaDog gig in London.  Similar to a rave but more trancy tribal music and with better visuals.
690	We (my friend and his girlfriend) had purchased our tickets the day prior to the gig and had spent the rest of the time what gear to take and use.  George (as he shall be called) had already gone to Amsterdam and obtained a thousand 'groucho marx' (rectangular tabs) and was hiding them from his mum in his computer.
691	A few hours before entrance we had gone to a couple of pubs and had some alchohol (I've never seen too much of a hazard of mixing small amounts of drink with other drugs) and managed to have ourselves a bit of a smoke.  I had to smoke via a pipe coz I can't stand tobacco so I'm Mr Neat.  George prefers Skunk so Skunk it was.  
692	By the time we arrived at the que for the gig we were feeling mellow but happily nervous with anticipation.  We didn't even take much heed to the intensity of the cold of the night (November).
693	After the obligatory hands-up-search-for-anything type affair at the door and then sorting coats and tickets out we all went off to check out the venue.  We'd been there before but its always the thing to do.  The music was already thumping from various rooms and there was the feeling of adrenalin in the air.  The main arena was warming up with the likes of Astralasia with deep base sounds that reverberated around the walls and straight through you.  That was good in itself.
694	Soon afterwards we met up again and decided that we would take just half of a trip for now.  Because half was the size of a normal one I knew at some point I was going to come up pretty hard.  One by one we filed off to the loos and dropped our gear.  
695	I ALWAYS have a nauseous feeling when I swallow the tab.  I think its due to the anticipated nausea that some of us get when coming up.  So after swallowing I did the innevitable body shiver with a screwed up face and went to the bar to get some water.
696	The next forty five minutes or so we spent leaning against the wall nodding our heads to the music and occasionally taking swigs of water.  We all do it!  I think I was the last to come up and when that happens you automatically think you've got a dud.  But low and behold I remember the first twinge of slight sickness.  It made me shift my position and then I felt the warm sensation in my stomach.  this made me breath in deep and I felt my cheeks redden.  Loverly!  The smile stretched across my face and I just let it take control.
697	It came in waves and eventually remained a constant.  My weight was lifted and I felt light as a feather.  Goose bumps flittered up and down my arms as I felt the steady thump of the base pulsating through my body.  Ten minutes later and I couldn't resist the urge to dance and I was off!  Eventually I was at the front of the crowd near the speakers and the stage where the djs were and loving it.
698	Every now and then I would come off for a breather.  Sometimes I found George and his girlfriend sitting down with huge grins on their faces.  We would exchange slow nods and smiles (all that's needed) and do our own thing.  I remember that when I danced my arms and hands seemed to move in a slow motion with my eyes and head following their movement.  It seemed much slower than the music was going but I seemed to be hitting the beat every time.
699	A couple of hours later and I was absolutely caned - I was sweating buckets and could hardly speak.  I would walk through the crowds as if drifing or floating and the people would just melt out of the way.  There were no sudden movements from me - well of course not, I could predict the entire movements of everyone in the building and new exactly when to turn or glide this way and that.  I was dancing a routine through the crowd that had been pre-written for me - it was fantastic.
700	The first hallucination I had was when I entered one of the chill out bars.  The very first thing I saw was the stone slabs that they used for the floor.  Then I saw the some grungy people with green army coats in the corner and then a spilt drink to my right.  It was dark here and quite crowded.  In that split second my brain had already made up its mind on where it thought it was.  Quickly the bar melted and revealed the dungeon that I was really in.  I moved slowly through looking at the dripping water and the rats that scurried out of my way.  Prisoners of some other era lay dormant in their green macs in the corners.  The stone walls had green alghi and other damp patches everywhere.  I had to shake my head before the bar materiallised.  'For gods sake' I reminded myself, 'its a fucking bar'.  As I ordered another bottle of water the images kept repeating.  I didn't panic though - it was interesting and I remember thinking how it could happen that anyone could possibly get from a bar to a dungeon cell.
701	Later I bumped into another friend who was smoking some skunk as he always did.  He seemed able to talk fine and was asking me various polite questions.  Unfortunately,  with every word he spoke I was thinking of a thousand answers and when I eventually opened my mouth to speak, a million words tried to form but ended up in alot of giberish and a few audible 'erms' and 'ums'.  This worried me a little as I was becoming increasingly aware that he could tell I was off my rocker.  I had to control the panic welming inside.  Was he looking at me strangely?  Was he giving subtle hand signals to others to suggest I was stupid? Was the group over there giggling at what I was doing, or wearing - or NOT wearing?  I looked down to check if I my trousers had disappeared.  Again, I had to shake my head.  No-one was taking the piss out of me so calm down!
702	I met with George who asked if I wanted to up to the balcony to calm down.  I nodded and followed like a zombie.  I passed a couple of people collecting for children in need who collered me for money - I think I gave them a fiver - they knew I was totalled and slapped a sticker on my chest.  I remember they made it cover the face of mona lisa I had printed with fractals and a spliff.  They thought it was funny.  I just wanted to get away from their voices that were changing pitch from high to low and back again.
703	Upstairs everyone was lying or sitting down.  I had to pick my way through all the bodies and sit down.  We sat for a while and I was able to cool down a bit.  Someone tapped me twice on the shoulder.  I looked round but noone was even near me.  I freaked!  I wasn't bolloxed enough that I couldn't mistake that tap.  And I sure as hell knew that no-one was near me.  'What's up?'  George asked.  'blddysbbbllblbl...um'  I replied in good effort and then pointed to my sticker on my chest.  It had gone!  Oh my god, had the mysterious tapper pinched it or had I imagined those people downstairs?  I hadn't imagined the fiver that was for sure.  Panic was on its way back again. 
704	I got up and decided to go back for a dance - yeh dancing would get my head back to noddy land.  within a few minutes I was leaping around madly fallowing the green and red fractal designs that my hands were making whilst courting with the flashing lights.
705	Now, George had warned me previously about some type of Ether that companies were putting into their smoke machine during these times.  He'd said it was like Amyl Nitrite in that it brought everyone up in seconds without them knowing and then they'd have a really ace time and tell all their friends about the gig - thus more gigs.  He also said that it had a habit of multiplying the effects of any substances that you were on by about four times.  Looking back I think it was some urban rumours that were going around - but I still think about it.  Anyway, I remember at one point (when Eat Static were playing) at a crux of a tune the smoke machine let out loads and ingulfed everyone.  In the next few seconds I watched as if not part of my body, as EVERYONE became one moving body.  Their eyes all widened and searching forwards.  it was like a huge wave of bodies all under one control.  Then, all of a sudden I felt my left upper leg lock in intense cramp.  I dropped like a sack of spuds and then really panicked.  No-one had even noticed I was writhing in agony!  If anything, they all seemed to just dance on me.  I picked a direction and crawled through the feet of the possessed crowd until I came to a door.  Stumbling through I was in a corridor and managed to slump myself down on a chair.  
706	Whilst massaging my leg I remember that my leg was starting to fade in green and red fractals and the floor was alive with sparks of these patterns.  All I could think was 'oh for gods sake not now'  I didn't panic then and was more pissed of that I couldn't benefit the picture because of the cramp.  A girl materialised with a glass of water-'...just as you asked-'  I smiled and wondered when I had asked her.
707	The pain subsided and I calmed down and I sat back and watched the patterns for a while.  Green and red sparkes were shooting across the floor and all over my hands.  The walls were pulsating and shifting colours and the music was altering its pitch chaotically.  Sitting there I could at last appreciate it for what it was and desperately wanted to work out how it happens.  At that point George came through the door with his girlfriend and they didn't look to pleased.  They asked it I'd noticed the change on the dance floor and George kept on saying about the Ether.  We all agreed to go outside into a square that was part of the building's grounds.  Here we were able to cool down.  I didn't bother speaking but just listend to the whispers of other conversations all around me.  The sound was like the noise of the sea genlty rolling on a shingle beach.
708	Soon we decided to leave.  I had to be led as I could no longer steer myself in the mathematical fashion I had done before.  I remember walking onto the street and seeing the cars.  The tracers that the cars left behind made it seem as if they were moving at high speed.  Watching them it seemed like they were moving at one mile and hour.  The noise was jingle jangle of squeaks and mumbles.  Getting a cab was the funniest part as neither of us was in any decent enough position to speak properly and we had to enter an office to order it.  It seemed like it took twenty minutes to get the words out and then we were in the car-I was sitting in the front.  
709	In London the all night cabs are driven by dodgy people with their own cars.  It suddenly dawned on me that we could be taken advantage of here.  None of us would be able to put up a struggle.  I didn't even know where the hell I was let alone put my fists up.  My door was opened and a man started shouting.  This was it, I thought.  We're gonna get mugged and I'm supposed to be the tougher one.  I started laughing.  As it turned out the guy thought our driver was taking his fare.  A few seconds later and we were off.  We stopped under a bridge briefly so that I could be sick out of the car.  George was putting it down to the effects of the Ether - again.
710	When we got back I got the cramps again and George's girlfriend got me some salt/sugared water which worked a treat (strongly suggest it for dehydration) and I lay there quietly tripping and slowly coming down.
711	With no sleep, I was up and had left by six thirty in the morning.  I had to travel the underground to Victoria and then down to Brighton (about sixty miles) to work.  Needless to say I was completey plastered and still a little bit tripping.  My boss was not amused.
712	That's it.  It was, looking back on it a great time and well worth it.  For since then I have been able to work out my own personal dosage and have developed a good understanding of hallucinations and what to expect.  If ever I take trips now its usually about a quater of a tab at a time.
713	One good thing about trips is the ability for hand-eye co-ordination.  I have learnt some of my best tricks whilst tripping.

715	A few weeks ago after a local concert a friend of mine named Chris and I had nothing to do, and it was about 1:30am. I offered him to trip with me and we both dropped a ten strip of pink elephant blotter. We are both experienced acid heads who've done that much before, so we weren't expecting anything out of the ordinary which is why we didn't get a sitter.
716	At about 2 while I was buying Chris some cigaretts the acid began to work. As I walked into the CVS, the shop lifting detectors started to go off. This got me really paranoid and I thought that someone was going to arrest me so I ran out of the store and threw anything in my pockets that would've set off the alarm, and went back in. This time it was ok and nothing was beeping so I bought the cigarettes, and when I gave her the money her face became colored with what reminded me of indian war paint. I got to thinking that, I was in store for a really intense trip, that I wasn't prepared for.
717	We got to Chris's house and sat in my friend Shaun's van, I asked Chris how he was doing and he said he wasn't doing that well and he thought it was a little too intense too. After talking to Chris for awhile I looked out the window of the van, and saw a pit of alligators and other lizards where grass normally is. I thought this was amazing and couldn't believe how real they looked, and all of a sudden a man riding a horse was charging down the street. Holy shit I thought, he's coming for me. Then he was gone I look all around and the alligators are still there. This isn't good my visuals usually go away after blinking or looking at something else, but this was different they wouldn't leave, are they real or fake I couldn't decided. My mind would not tell me. 
718	I tell Chris whats going on he isn't doing well either but by far better than I'm doing. He tells me to go with him to see Shaun. I don't want to leave the gators were still there, he convinces me to go with him somehow. Inside Shaun's house the concrete floor is nothing but crocodile heads, and then blue and orange snakes apear and I can feel them crawling beneath my feet. Finally, Shaun shows up my whole body is shaking and I've chewed a straw into almost nothing. Shaun trys to calm me down but he can't help. So we leave.
719	Next thing I can remember we're in a soccer field sitting on some bleachers the aligators are still there, but I've found out they don't want me, right now all of the alligators are fighting and fucking each other and are ignoring me for now. As we walk into the field there is a force field constructed by diamond shapes and as I walk through I can feel it. The stars in the sky have turned red and are shooting out white light. I look across the street and see dinosaurs, I ignore them. Holy shit there are 2 cars pulling into the field, are they cops? My friend assures me they are not and I hear a robotic voice yell 'get over here' Chris tells me he didn't hear anything. I begin to power walk back to Shaun's. 
720	That is all I can remember from that night, but I know I spent a lot more time shaking and being frightened. I think I had such a bad trip because of two things, one no sitter, and two I couldn't decifer what was real or fake. The whole next day I didn't sleep at all and spent most of the day silent.

722	LSD (2) : Various (28), Bad Trips (6), General (1)
723	I went away from my job in Pittsburgh for the weekend of July 4th.  I met up with some travelers at the Pittsburgh Intern'tl Airport and we drove up to Ridgeway Pa in a rental car.  I was there for the weekend, and while camping down in the Bear Creek valley I heard that somebody was throwing a rave up in the main 'Owl's Nest' parking lot.  I chose not to go.  The night of July 4th I was walking with a good friend i hadn't seen in a long time.  He had been a soldier for the US army until he got kicked out for smoking pot.  
724	Anyway, he convinced me to go up to the rave that night in the parking lot.  He and I walked up to the A-camp that was nearby to get a ride to the main parking lot about 2 miles away.  I bought 2 hits for blotter from an older hipped out brother and gave one to my friend.  We were speculating about the authenticity of the stuff i'd just bought when some dude and his passenger asked us if we wanted a ride. We hopped right in and drove off for the parking lot where the rave was.  
725	We were crusing along with some strangers who were probably already tripped out, and here there was some other guy walking along the road.  The driver stopped and asked the guy if he wanted a ride.  So this other dude with a bookbag gets in the back seat with us.  He was rather 'studious' looking.  He was wearing glasses and had a button down shirt with a collar.  After we had went along a bit he asked the driver if he wanted any 'dose'.  The driver and his passenger declined.  My friend Hayden and i looked at each other and i then asked if we could have some.
726	This dude pulls out a chemistry lab storage bottle with a dropper at the top of it.  This bottle was brown glass and probably about 1000mL.  He says 'This is the washout from the basins that they use to make LSD.  Some elders gave it to me and told me to pass it on.'  
727	My friend and i thinking it was diluted each took about 2 droppers full of the liquid.  I distinctly remember swishing the liquid around in my mouth. 
728	So hayden and i were dropped off at the parking lot, and i began to feel the effects of the L starting to kick in.  We found out that we had quite a way to go to get to the party.    Hayden walked off and i sat down beside someone's dark green Vw bus.  I enjoyed laying there and i felt it's personality communing with me.  
729	I got up and went to walk down the road to the rave.  The effests were coming on strong now.  A group was a little bit ahead of me and someone had some glowsticks on a string spinning them around.  I kept thinking that they had lightsabers.  I caught up to the group, and i could hear a girl breathing across the road from me.  I moved closer to her. I felt that i needed to protect her.  I was her bodyguard.  I had no idea who she was.  I asked her name and she told me it was Amy.  
730	We walked further down the road.  Where was Hayden?  The moon was full, the silver light casting everything in a spacey glow. What a wonderful time i was going to have!!
731	I was a little scared form time to time, but the fear faded quickly.  The thing i was most concerned about was becoming confused and disoriented.
732	The group i was walking with finally got to the rave.  There at the entrance to the litle space off the road was Hayden.  I hugged him and he laughed.  He kept poking me to see if i was really there.  He said something to me about being naked, so i walked over behind the setup.  There was a u-haul and a gasoline generator with a tent canopy set up for the DJ booth.  I walked behind there and took off my clothes.  That's when the thoughts invaded.
733	Hayden had been in the Army.  He had been in communications. He had somehow taken contol of a government communications satelite. Here he was playing techno music on the world communication network!!!  He was the DJ!!!  I was running around naked yelling at the people over at the DJ booth to leave him alone.  
734	Then i thought that I was in the making of the next Star Wars... Episode II.  Frank Oz the voice of Yoda had died, and i was the only one who could talk like Yoda. I was running around talking like Yoda.  I thought my friends Laurie and Melissa were there.  I remember talking to a girl who i thought was Laurie.  That's when the corporations too over.
735	Since hayden had stolen the satelite, the top companies of the world wanted to restore peace.  An asian girl sat near me and mentioned somethign about Ford.  She was the daughter of the top Ford exec!!!  For some reason she got mad and went to walk away.  I tried to get her to stay there.  So i followed her to the entrance.  And there was Hayden!
736	He talked to me for a little bit and i asked him to help me find my clothes.  after a while he looked down at me and exclaimed 'You don't have any clothes!!!'  'I know!!! Help me find them, they're lost!!!!'
737	I did find my shoes, and i walked back out to the dirt roadway.  I was looking at the moon, and i kept seeing a laser beam shoot across my vision ala Dark Side of the Moon.  So i walked off in the direstion i thought leaded back to the main parking lot.  I was walking over near the edge of the road, and i entered the woods.  I was feeling kinda funny.  I stumbled into the brush, and i remember crashing over and falling down.  I was dying.
738	My mind drifted off into a Tolkien book.  I could see the words written in that elegant text.  I was part of the earth and my body melted (rotted?) away and for a thousand years i was a hillside.  Then water and wind pushed away the dirt and i was flat again.  It was like i was reliving that part of the earth's memory.  
739	I became concious lying on my back staring up at the stars through the canopy of leaves.  I had the feeling i was lying in a net.  Some people were talking to me.  This was a test.  I was being trained for the special underground organization that Hayden belonged to.  I was held in a net and i felt my mind drift away.  I became a two dimensional object.  I was a 'downward spiral'.  I was spinning and spinning and drifting downwards.  Images came to my mind of two seperate entities.  A goat an a dove were pulling in opposite directions.  I had a message sent into my brain.  
740	'There is no greater wrong than a child torn between the parents of two different religions'
741	I spiraled off some more and i became the film of oil on a stagnant stream, and i looked up to see a dragonfly land above me.  It's compound eye glittered in the sunlight.  I then became one of the facets of the eye.  The words of Albert Einstein entered my mind.  'I just want to know the thoughts of God. Everything else is just details.'  I saw Einstein as he arrived in heaven. He asked God what the answer to life was, and God said 'YES'.  As i became coherent i thought that God had let me travel back through time and space.  I had been allowed to go back to 1978.  I was allowed to travel to San fransisco, California in that year.
742	I got up and broke free from my 'net'.  As I walked out of the woods i thought i could surf.  I ran down the road as fast as i could, and i stopped a guy standing beside the road.  'What year is it?'  He looked at me kinda funny and answered '1999, dude'
743	So i tried to find my clotes again, but no dice.  At least i had my shoes.  Now, if i could only find which way i was supposed to go.  I walked for a bit and ran into a 'DEP' officer.  I walked over to him and asked him how to get to get to the parking lot. He issued me a ticket.  I didn't have any pockets, so i slipped it in the window of a parked car along the road.  I kept walking, and if i saw a car approach, i would hide in the woods.  I stopped by another car along the road, and i asked a guy that was camping there  for a pair of pants i could wear.  He hooked me up with some pajamas pants.
744	I finally made it to the parking lot after an eternity of walking.  I had lost Hayden, but i knew i'd see him again. I went over to the rental car i had come up in, and layed on the back window.  I looked up at the stars, and i saw the milky way smeared across the darkness. I fell asleep glad to be out of the whole mess.  Someone nearby was playing some Grateful Dead on a car stereo, and i fell asleep to Jerry's guitar.  
745	I woke up a little later and i was freezing.  I got up and walked around.  Two cars over someone had left their window down.  I looked inside and decided that they wouldn't mind if i slept for a little bit inside.  I opened the door and crashed out again on their back seat.  
746	When i woke up in the morning, i rolled up the window of the car and walked down to the valley to meet my traveling companions.

749	I feel a little guilty about submitting this since I haven't been able to read the entire experience archives and have no way of knowing if this is a rather common experience or not.
750	I love acid, but I usually have a problem finding time to have a whole trip Micro dots are like litte aspirin pills of acid and they can, we realized be crushed up and snorted.  This way the trip hits a lot faster and lasts a lot less time.  something to try if you ever get a hold of some dots.

1	MDMA (3) : General (1), Depression (15), Hangover / Days After (46), Relationships (44), Small Group (2-9) (17)
2	Every time I've done E I have had a horribly excruciating headache the day (and sometimes several days) after. I decided it was worth it anyway, after a couple times of use because I can only be open and honest when I'm rolling. About the fourth time I did E, everything was great until I started to come down (I was about two hours behind everyone else, so they were already asleep). I felt like I could never be happy again and I hated myself. I felt so lonely and hopeless that I just sobbed and cried for about two hours until I finally fell asleep. It was horrible. I still plan to use E again, and I am hoping that was just a one time experience, but it's not something I wish to repeat. I cried on and off for the next couple days for no good reason, too.

4	MDMA (3) : General (1), Retrospective / Summary (11), Difficult Experiences (5), Hangover / Days After (46), Unknown Context (20)
5	Basically the day after I've taking MDMA I feel quite drained and lazy, however I mainly put this down to the fact that when I use this drug it is very late at night and tends to run into the small hours of the next morning (6-9am).  
6	Also when I decide to call it a night I have great difficulty in getting to sleep, mainly due to my imagination thinking up the biggest load of crap which gets quite annoying.
7	The next day and days after I have never felt any depression, after I've gotten some sleep I feel perfectly normal.
8	I've been taking this drug on a regular bases from I was 17 and I'm now 22 just incase people wanted to know what effects it has over the years on a regular user.
9	Over all when the night is over and the sleeping is done, I feel quite normal, maybe dehydrated or chapped lips but thats the worst of my symtoms.

12	Alright, first off. I've been using speed for most of 2 years. I've tried just about everything thats readily available on the street. One day I'm talking to my friend (D) and he says he can get pink dolphins...So being the curious person I am I said hook it up, so his friend talked to me and I met him somewhere and picked up 2 pills. Got home took one and waited...then I cut some of the other pill and cut it up and snorted it..then decided to just eat it....After that it was shower time..I felt a little wierd but nothing specific..then I got out of the shower and noticed everything seemed very clear and warm...I went out to have a cigarette and thats when the fun began...life was just pouring into me, I could taste,smell,feel,hear and touch everything good in life. I finished my cig and went inside....everything felt fake,like I was dreaming..I never expected it to be like this. I played some guitar and I could feel the music, like the guitar was part of me, and it almost became too intense. Overall I feel one with the world...life is vivid and full...the world is my oyster and I'm about to slurp that sucker down

15	First time using MDMA. Used about 350mg in a 6 hour timespan.
16	Effects were terrific euphoria at first, and a relaxed comedown after that.
17	Day after: still somewhat trippy, compassionate with others, unable to focus on complex subjects, restless, no appetite.
18	Day 2: somewhat restless, tired, limited appetite.
19	Day 3: appetite returned, somewhat 'down' feeling, dizziness and 'brain zaps', difficulty to concentrate on subjects requiring focus of mind.
20	Day 4: dizziness and brain zaps, other effects remained although lighter than before.

22	MDMA (3) : Not Applicable (38), Hangover / Days After (46), First Times (2), General (1)
23	Alright so I peaked right, well I don't think my 'crash' is like most people's ya know?  It doesn't actually hit me until the day after the day.  I think it's because I roll late at night since I work until about 11.30 or sometimes 1.30.  So I roll late then the next morning (about 6) I'm starting to come down.  So it doesn't set in until a day after that.  My crash isn't as much of a crash as it is a numbness.  It's not that I feel bad, I don't feel anything.  I guess I appear to be in a bad mood since I don't really feel like talking to anyone.  The truth is that I'm not in a bad mood, I have zero mood....no good emotions no bad ones.  It's the most severe case of indifference ever...and it's really not all that bad.  I would say a hangover on alcohol is way worse...

26	Being no stranger to the wonderful world of esctasy, I finally did what had been suggested. I ground up 1 pill. Put it in a Plunger (the kind you put medicine in when your child is sick) Sucked in a little water, mixed the mixture up.  Put a little lube on the back door, carefully inserting the syringe about 2-3 inches in, and plunge. I only added about 3ccs of water. This is approx. 9pm 
27	Normally, e takes about 1 hour for me to start feeling it.
28	9:30pm starting to feel the come up. 10pm had 1 mixed alcoholic beverage.
29	10:15pm wow - Much more intense than I'm used to. 11:30pm Another Drink Please! Feeling Great! I have downed 2 bottles of water by this time.
30	Feeling awesome until the club closes at1:30pm. Head home, some a little weed and go to bed at 3am
31	All in all, I will do it this way again! very clean, no mess and wow, it was like taking 2 pills orally!

33	We had been preparing for my friend R's 16th birthday for about a month. We were all going to roll, some people for their first time. The party was planned entirely for an ecstasy trip. I couldnt wait until 7:00 (when the party started) so I crushed a pill after school and drank the powder. When taken this way it kicks in a lot faster and harder but lasts about 3-4 hours. I was still rolling when I got to the party, but I took another pill. I never dance, so I wasn't sure what kind of things I would do, but it was fun and I think I made an idiot of myself when I talked to people that weren't rolling. I had this really weird feeling of connection with this girl, B, I had never met. I haven't seen her other than at the party, but at the time she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. I was going to talk to her when R tells me he just asked her out. Immediately the thought of wanting her changed to being incredibly happy for them, but I was also envious of R. After dancing, I sat by the fire with R and B and we just talked about random things. I had a reason to be connected with R, who is my good friend, but I now realize I dont even know B. Sometime during the party, my friend A gave me a small dose of ketamine, which I snorted and got threshold effects. 
34	When I got home at 11:30, I crushed another pill and drank it. 7 of the 10 people that rolled were sleeping at my house. We all hung out doing random things and I snorted 1/4 of a pill. My dad came home with his girlfriend at 3:30, so they took 2 pills and I took another one. His gf crushed 2 pills and drank them at once and said she hadnt been that fucked up in 10 years. The 4th pill didnt hit me very hard even though I had taken the same one earlier, but I did feel a meth high. At 5:30, we came to the conclusion that there  might be some meth in the pills. An hour later we decided to snort 1/3 and GO TO SLEEP!! We were gonna go to sleep after snorting pills with meth in them and nobody thought it was weird. The three people who snorted the 1/3 never slept and the people who did only got a couple hours.
35	We were so fried the next day that we forgot what we were saying in midsentence and we couldnt follow thing that were normally simple but now seemed complicated.

37	There is a very important fact about crashing on mdma I would like to share with you! About a year ago when I first took mdma . After the initial (fantastic) feeling ended I began to feel dreadful. I sat in the corner in my friends apartment quietly as my two friends continued to dance as we had been doing for the last 3 hours. Suddenly I told them' listen , dont get me wrong , but I think I hate you guys'. One of my friends, who was very experienced with the drug, quickly said '  go right now and take a hot shower'. I at first told him no thanks but he insisted and said further that it must be incredibly hot, as hot as I could take. I proceded to shower and not only was the shower great but when I came out I felt my high had returned! It was less powerful than before but nevertheless back! It is the best cure against crashing and a shower every time I feel like I'm coming down hard will lead to a gradual and even pleasant fall from grace. Unfortunately this cure for crashes dos not keep away day after and week after hangovers from the drug, and I say that from experience.

40	I've been using MDMA on and off for 9 years now. Its an amazing substance.  In my quest for data, I recently measured blood pressure and body temp prior to dosing, and then T+1:30.  
41	None of this is surprising, just thought I'd share a data-point.
42	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
43	This year I decided to go to monster massive and before hand I got some capsules from a buddy of mine. He assured me it was pure MDMA and in my opinion I believe him. So we get inside and I take two capsules while my other friends took their pills in line. About an hour after getting there I start to feel it while I'm dancing, I feel a rush of energy to my head as I look around at the lights, they were so glorious and bright. I start playing with some glowsticks when they start to kick in, the glow sticks start to get blurry and I felt extreme euphoria. At one point while I was dancing I looked up at the stage and bright white light fell on me and I felt as if I was in heaven. I could not resist the urge to dance. About half an hour later I decide to sit down with my buddy who is stuck sitting down at this point in time and I can't help but talk to all the people around me. I was told I had a giant grin on my face although I had no idea until that point. As I'm sitting all I want to do is soak in the music and enjoy the roll. It felt extremely good to be touched by anything and I felt absolutely amazing. Then alittle bit later my jaw would be chattering up and down without hitting my top teeth, and I had absolutely no jaw clenching. Later on I danced and danced and just loved the music and people that I talked to. That night I slept like a baby and got up around 9 in the morning. I had no negative side affects through out this entire period.

46	I spent about three days taking blue dolphins and other tabs.  The high was fantastic, but when it finally wore off, I became sad enough to kill myself.
47	The strongest feeling I had was that I was a terrible, worthless person, and that the world was sad and dirty.  I found myself pacing and crying and fidgeting.  I could not close my eyes to sleep, and I very badly wanted to be held.
48	My mind replayed every 'bad' or stupid thing I'd ever done, over and over, and I felt like I deserved to die.  
49	I found that taking a low dose of Prozac as I was coming down helped lessen my crashes.  I have clinical depression, so any break from my gloominess, like the one Ex provides, works really well.  When I'm depressed and coming out of a happy experience back to my sadness, I guess a crash is to be expected.
50	  Four tabs is a bit much for me, and after the second, the effects just aren't as strong.

52	While it may be that the substance described is pure MDMA, Ecstasy/Molly tablets and powders are notoriously impure, misrepresented, or adulterated. Ecstasy sold in retail contexts such as festivals or parties often contain chemicals other than MDMA.] 
53	First of all, I'm from Holland, 18 years old and you could call me a typical Dutch kid: the first time I smoked weed was at 12 years old and I didn't stop ever since. I knew, in the future, I was going to use drugs and when I was fifteen, after some online research, somewhere in june I had my first mushroom trip and it was great. We had dried shrooms(can't remember what kind)and I took about 5 medium sized ones. Since then I used mushrooms every one, one and a half month in summer and once every three months in winter(something like that). 
54	At the end of july I had my first XTC experience. Me and my ex-girlfriend both took one green 2000 tab wich I stole from my mother. I still think they had some MDA in it because I had some pretty funny visuals: I stood half naked in front of a mirror and while looking at my muscles I saw myself turning into a H-man type of character, wich was really surprising. The pattern on my girlfriends shirt changed and at some point we looked at eachother and we both saw sunglasses on our heads. Also the whole night it seemed as if the room was smaller(or I was bigger). The year after that we did it nearly every month but in a more easy way: never more than half a pill at a time and we just sat at home talking about our problems, analyzing and trying to solve them. The next one and half year I worked as a cook(40-50 hours a week) so we couldn't party to much. 
55	Then we broke up and since I used to live with her I suddenly was free to do what I wanted, and being without a job, that's what I did. I started doing pills every two weeks, sometimes with friends but to many times alone. And then new years eve came....
56	I was at a party in one of my best friends(I'll call him E) house and I had 3 pills with me, another guy had 2 and we shared them with four other guys. It was the first time for three of them and we had the best night ever. My parents gave a teKno(lotta noise) party wich ended at six o'clock in the morning, aftering at my parents house and we were all(me, my mother, stephdad and friends) fucked up. And it was great!
57	We did nothing up to two monts after new year, and then we started the fun times wich started with the experience I want to share with y'all. 
58	It was friday and we decided to have a party. There was a new phone number(...) so we called it and made an appointment 1 hour later. I gave the guy 20 euros and I expected to get about 8 or 10 tabs(normal price here) but after we meeted I looked in the bag and we got 20 tabs!!!! It were very large white ferrari horses and, as I was told, they were 110mg MDMA. Trying to be responsible we all took one half to start with. But after half an hour we took another half and than a whole one, an hour later. We were in the centre at a bar and we had a very good time. We left before closing time and we just started walking trough our town, smoking a lot of weed(a standard when were fucked up), running around doing all kinds of crazy shit.
59	I can't really remember the next two hours but my friends all went home at about four o' clock. I invited E to my home to smoke some more and to let the easy's wear of.  
60	My parent's house is great when your fucked up: there are 3000 cd's from aphex twin to buena vista social club, from the Wu to Bob Marley, there's a fire place with a matrass in front of it and I am allowed to smoke weed inside. The last pill we dropped was at two and we were still high as ever. So naturally(...) we took another half, rolled a joint, aphex twin in the cd player and kicked back on the matrass in the centre of the living room(we didn't lit the fire place) and just started talking. This was really difficult because every 10 minutes we forgot what we were talking about. I had really clear visuals like red stripes on a cd cover wich I looked at for a minute and after looking again disapeared. Also the ceiling had a zebra type of pattern wich was very similair to what the pattern on my exes shirt looked like. So now my question is: who's had green 2000 tabs or white ferrari's and what was in them?!  Could be a combo between MDA and MDMA or maybe it possible to get visuals from just MDMA.

62	MDMA (3) : General (1), What Was in That? (26), Various (28)
63	I recently had my first experience with Ecstacy, and it was life altaring.
64	It was about 8 o clock on a saturday night when I first took the pill. I was sitting in my friends room with friends play video games, chilling listening to music with blacklights and neon lights everywhere.  About a half hour passed and I didnt feel much different but I could tell it was coming.  About 9 o clock, it hits me hard, and I'm just sitting there listening to music and chilling.  I was the only one rolling so when everyone noticed me there were laughing and I just wanted to hug them all.  I started feeling like my friends were the best thing to ever happen to me.  About 10 minutes after it hits me,  we deicided to walk to the next town over and hang out with some kids.  So I got my Ipod. And started riding my bike.
65	I got about half way there and I saw like 20 of my friends all sitting in cars on my friends front lawn,  I went up to them and they all started hugging me and rubbing my head and this girl gave me this spinning light show for the ride there,  I was ridding down the rode listening to the gorrilaz and staring at the light show, and it was the most intense ride of my life,  I loved everything, I didnt care about one thing, all I cared about was my music.  I finally get there and we go to this fort in the woods,  theres about 10 kids there all just hanging out, smoking,  having a good time, I just got up and went out side the first and danced and ran around for an hour and it was so much fun,  I hugged a lot of people and it made me really happy.  Its now about 11 and we go back to my friends house to meet up with him,  I'm still rolling pretty hard.  We get there and I give him a hug and he says'Fuck you! I'm so jelous!' and we just laughed.  He turns off the lights and puts on an amazing playlist for the night,  and I just take my spinning light show and start dancing, I didnt care who was looking or how dumb I looked, all I knew was I was having an amazing time.
66	At about 11 30, I was coming down a tiny bit but still have the time of my life,at this point I started grinding my teeth, so my friend gave me some gum to chew on because he said thats the worst thing to be doing.  So at about 12 o clock everyones gone except me and two of my friends one passed out and the other with a joint in his hand, he comes up to me and says 'wanna go smoke this?'  so we go in his backyard and me and him are just talking smoking a nice joint having a really chill time,  at that point my roll started to come back because everything was just so chill and so easy going.  Everything went right.  At about 1 o clock I started coming down again,  I was coming down very smoothly and I didnt crash at all.  But I still felt like going out and having a good time with friends.  
67	  This drug was life altaring,  after my experience, I think a lot more and understand things a lot better, it made me realize the good in everything.

70	Every now and then me and some friends just roll for the hell of it. My friend warned me about the tablets being pretty strong but I thought to myself I have taken 1 and a half pills before I'm sure 2 wont matter much. Well the time I was high was really amazing felt fuckin insane in a good way lol. But the crash was HELL I was laying on my bed weak, sweating, nauseated and aching all over. I finally had to go throw up, I stood up and walked out of my room heading for the bathroom but then everything started turning black and I passed out right then and there. About 1 min later however my sister shook me awake and I went back to bed. Nothing worse happened but just learned that, I should be more careful when dosing Ecstasy =]

73	I took the 2 epills at like 2:15 and they kicked in real fast because I hadn't eaten anything but a bagel and a piece of fruit. I was with others who were rolling as well, but my high was definitely coming on harder and stronger and I couldn't deal with their fast talking. I turned some dvd on earlier that I thought may be sweet to watch rollin and tried to focus on it but it felt like my vision was darting back and forth and I needed to close my eyes and try to chill.
74	After regaining composure, sort of, I opened my eyes again held my knees close, blocked out the voices, and actually enjoyed the hilarity of what I was watching even though I was shaking and kind of freaking out as the e was coming on stronger. Then the voices of my fellow rollers starting to get to my high and I definitely felt like I had to vom, but I felt like I had control over it. I just went downstairs and vomited in the toilet down there (which is what happens basically at the beginning of whenever I roll) and felt better. When I came back upstairs I felt like they were on my level and we all chilled in the dark with the computer playing music and watching the screen. We'd drink water ritually and made sure to do everything together at the same time, and make sure we were all feeling good and were comfortable, but it really just felt like we were all freaking out and I wish it could've been more chill. When we came down from the e we took some sedatives to make it less painful, but the morale of the group then plummeted and the other people I was rollin with were miserable and it bummed me out big time. I just wanted to be alone. 
75	Once I got home I still felt ok, but after I took a nap and woke up I felt miserable. Absolutely  miserable. Nothing was good everything was bad and I felt so alone.
76	I eventually got to feeling better after I took more sedatives and smoke more weed but was still sore and the sadness still lingered.

79	We rolled on some molly a few times here in town that looked like a light brown almost tanish yellow colored shards that looked like smashed up fine glass, I prefer the parachute method in taking my molly. But the roll was amazing, definitely one of the most fun drugs ever. Impossible to not have fun, I actually rolled hard enough that when I was peaking I was kinda tripping, everything was shaking and I couldn't focus perfectly with my eyes. The body buzz was very very tingly and intense, my senses got enhanced alot, especially colors, and brightness, tracers, and touch. I wanted to constantly share with every one, a few group hugs felt right. Very fun times. Dubstep is awesome as fuck on molly!

82	Me and my friend did ecstasy on Friday. Today is Monday and I'm just crying for no reason. It is terrible... The depression is just so big I don't know what to do... I'm just crying. I swear I will never do it again and I just wish to get back to normal. 
83	I had done it before, too, like about 10 times, but never that much. I had taken 3 pills on one night the most. But this time I took 5. Very bad decision. 
84	My girlfriend told me she was also crying for no reason once she had amphetamine hang over. I didn't understand. But now I do.

87	I've done Ecstasy 3 times now, on my third time I took two pills at once.  My rolls were harsh on my body, grinding my jaw on straws was all I could do to keep from breaking my teeth.  My eyes wouldn't focus, and everything felt amazing.  My blankets around me felt like a euphoric cocoon.  I layed outside in the grass for hours feeling its cold against my skin.
88	The come down is tough though.  Next day I wake up im still shaking severely and I can't focus.  My head hurts.  My spine hurts.  My stomach hurts.  It was worth it.

91	'Do you want to try some X tonight?' I replied in a low tone, my heart pounding, and my body filled with energy as Alex Braxe spilled from the speakers in my car, Yeah I do.
92	The first time I tried X I was very afraid. I had seen commercials about its effects and one particular that stayed in my mind was one of a girl who had died from it. I wasn't a so-called 'druggie' I had done the obvious kinds of drugs in high school but nothing hard like X.
93	My brother is a DJ in the rave scene in L.A. and San Bernardino. He invited me to go with him one night if I agreed to give him a ride to the party. I agreed and brought along a childhood friend to come with me. Her name is Sebra and I brought her because I knew that if I were going to drop on X she would do it with me too.
94	When we got there, around 10pm, I saw groups of friends dressed in colors and beads greeting each other like family. Sebra and I walked hand in hand as we went inside. The building was small and there werent many people there. There was a guy spinning and the speakers were booming with loud beats. My brother Gabriel introduced us to some friends and we were soon recognized as newbies for the night. I met Lyric a small girl with a stuffed animal backpack and back rimmed eyeglasses. She reached in her bag and pulled out a string filled with bracelets. She proceeded to find one she said she had made for me specifically. She asked for my hand and held the bracelet on her fingers. As we held hands she curled the bracelet on to my wrist. The bracelet had beautiful, purple, magenta, and green beads in circles that resembled grapes. I love it!
95	Around 12am my brother approached Sebra and I with a bottle of water and placed a tablet in our palms. I looked at Sebra and almost wanted to cry. I had not even taken it yet and I was already happy. I looked at the light blue tablet; it had a crescent engraved in it. I placed it on my tongue and gulped the water down. Sebra did the same and then we hugged each other so tight and told each other that this was going to be a good night. 
96	The music and lights glowed friends crowed my brother as he span. Sebra and I danced together like no one was watching. All this was fun oh sure except that I was certain that while Sebra was in her high I was not. It was now 2am and I had not felt anymore different than that of 2 hrs ago. I began to become disappointed and the party was becoming more and more crowded. There had been another party that same night that was crashed; the remaining partygoers were coming to the one I was at. 
97	I wanted to leave for I was becoming claustrophobic in the room.
98	We said goodbye to everyone while Sebra and I walk to the exit. 
99	Just as my foot stepped onto the Los Angeles sidewalk it hit me like a bird crashing into a window. I stopped in my spot and looked at Sebra and smiled huge. She knew and started to laugh. I hugged her tight as we walked to the car, my brother behind me catching up with us.
100	I started to talk about things and people. Gabriel told me that I was talking about everything so beautifully. I put on Stereolab and felt the music flow though my body entering my fingers and caressing my face. I kept rubbing my knees and singing the songs. I thought about my world, my family, my friends, my ex. I felt happy and safe. I never wanted to leave the state I wanted to stay in my small xA and talk with Gabriel and Sebra. We brought orange juice at 7-11 and decided where to go at 3:30am in Los Angeles. I recommended Griffith Park so we went. I knew of a back trail and in the night we walked high up the mountain to a spectacular view of the city and its neighboring hills. The lights glittered like a million candles glimmering in a dark room. The tall homes under us were so close we could see the backyards. I felt at peace up there in the high sky looking down at the city I called my home. I though about my ex-boyfriend and how it took X for me to feel the feeling of let go for him. I was so happy and although I know the next day would be another challenge it was worth it. Worth it so that I can live and be awake to witness the beauty of the world and all it has to give to me as I to her.

103	Back in 2006 I did my first dose of many of MDMA.
104	Setting, London, more precisely Camden Town, at an underground rave party in a squat under a railway bridge. The music was booming and we bought 1 gram of MDMA for 4 of us at a very descent price. I made 2 parachutes of 125mg of MDMA each, it was an off white crystal, and down went the first parachute.
105	Fast forward half an hour and I'm feeling abnormally happy, I can feel the music in my stomach, as the techno booms away. Everyone is hugging and kissing each other, so I join in, definitely feeling the love. I dance away the night, and explore the squat. I feel like a million bucks. I dropped my second 125mg of MDMA about 5 hours after the first, and its around 5 AM. I throw up 45 minutes later, but I think most of the MDMA has entered my system. We continue raving away with my friends until about 9AM when the music stops.
106	I then leave the squat say goodbye to my friends and head off to get the bus back to my small university room in canterbury. The sun shinning is astonishingly bright, and all the colors look magic, however no luck, the bus fare is 11 pounds and I only have 6 pounds, so I have to beg in the bus station for 5 pounds to get my ride home... Luckily a couple of students help me out and I can get home. I put my mp3 player on my Drum n Bass playlist and dig the music for 2 hours on the ride home.
107	I get home and put on some music very loud in my room and dance by myself waiting for my friends to wake up. But I wore myself out so much over the past 24 hours I crash on my bed and sleep like a log for 24 hours.
108	This will be the first of many experiences with MDMA/XTC

111	I used X while I was at a rave, at the time it was the best feeling I've ever felt, but, now I greatly regret it, ever since I took it, 2 weeks ago, it has made me very depressed, and has also been the cause of me worrying excessively about things, 
112	I also have found myself crying for unexplained reasons and have never felt this bad before, I just hope it will get better and that people reading this will have an effect on their decision to take ecstasy.

115	When I take blue stars it always kicks in around exactly 40 minutes. I took it at 2:20 PM and it kicked in right around 3:00 PM.
116	I felt very energetic and horny. I took a 5 minute, extremely fast and energetic power walk to my friend's house. I had a strong urge to hug her and tell her how pretty she is. I layed on her couch and experienced intense vertigo. 
117	At 4:20 PM I took my second pill before I left my house to catch the subway from Brooklyn to Nyc. At around 5:00 PM on the train the second pill kicked in. I experienced EXTREME nystagmus and trisma . I saw two of everything. I couldn't bring my self to move. 
118	Around 6:00 PM I got off the train, this time I was walking VERY slow. I was not energetic but extremely sluggish. I walk to the store in the subway and got a straw and started chewing it right away. I was walking down 31st street at an incredibly slow pace, staring straight ahead seeing doubles while listening to comfortably numb. I had traffic piling up behind me. It took me 25 minutes to walk 2 city blocks. I was chewing this straw like an animal. People were staring at me as they went around me due to my abnormally slow pace. By around 7 I was coming down. I wasn't tripping, but I wasn't sober. The next day I felt great, happy, no soreness, no nausea, no headaches.

120	My dorm mates and I took quite a few drugs during our first year in college.  This included acid, mushrooms, lots of marijuana and XTC.  
121	The latter was by far the most pleasant experience any of us had ever had.  My experience with the substance is pretty much what I see mentioned elsewhere.  However there was one difference.  All of us experienced painful backaches the next day in addition to the 'wiped-out' feeling normally experienced.  The backaches were centered in the lower portion of our backs, and lasted for approx 18 hours.  After about a year of this, we concluded that MDMA was simply too dangerous and we gave it up.  
122	I'm 38 with four young children, and I still sort of miss that drug.  I haven't taken any drugs in 15 years.

Comparable to mushrooms. High lasted 45 minutes. Feelings of stars colliding and earth dismantling. Then a Drive home with friends.

128	I have used for about 15 years now.  I had normal healthy food on all occasions and work out regularly and am physically fit.
129	The come-up on .5-1 gram is slow. After 1 hour I take another hit.  30 minutes later the teeth are grinding.  I stand up and know whats after all this: The come down. 
130	I had nothing happen in the first 48 hours.  I went to bed and there was a sharp ringing in my ears while lying there.  It was persistent until I finally fell asleep hours later due to exhaustion.  
131	The next morning was fine.  About 12pm vertigo kicked in for a moment, briefly I have the shakes and still am having hot flashes that cause sweating.  I then went about my day.  In the evening I took what was left of my party favorite, and felt great sipping on some ice water watching a movie.  Sexual thoughts are at an all-time high, however the male performance from such high doses are not to my liking :/  not matter what! so charming a woman is great, if I want to get giggled about later!
132	The next day all is well-  16:00 vertigo kicks in again this time a bit longer and more intense.  I feel nauseous but get up and move around - vertigo gone! There are still the hot flashes.   
133	This goes on and on for about 5 more days.  The ringing stops at night.  The vertigo persists.  Day 9 still vertigo but not as frequent.
134	Day 10!  mild case of vertigo, but all in all feeling better, more concentrated and the mind is more clear than ever.  I am ready to do it again, but I noticed that after consuming one alcoholic drink, I had a killer headache.  
135	I have now had this 5 out of 5 times. and still the vertigo!  I hope I didnt finally overdo it.  I go to the doctor in a few days.

138	Dosage was a bit higher than last attempts (previous ingestion dated 2 weeks back 0,1g ). Because I was not satisfied with length of magic during that session. The flow of trip disappointed me with less spiritual fx. It is so sad :..(( Just a rollercoaster excitement and common excuse for audacious actions.  But that was just like camouflage. In fact I didn't feel extra cute (as I used to on MDMA) thoughts were distorted, speech damaged enough. And the worst thing is that I almost don't have point to doubt if it was not MDMA indeed. I'm really concerned to recover magical abilities

141	I had been using E for 3 years exactly. It was my first hit anniversary on Halloween, and I was at a private E party. The best DJs in this part of the country were spinning in my friend's living room that night... I was dressed up as a techno cat and having a blast, when this guy shouts out in my ear... He wanted me to give him a tiger balm massage. Between my brothers I'm always the one bringing the essential tiger balm... it's kinda my job... So I said sure... I gave him a big massage and then he did the same to me... He was so hot looking... wow... I was blown away... He was the only one at the party that I had never met before, and boy was I happy I had met him.
142	It has been two years since that party and I now live with the man of my life. Each time Halloween comes by we celebrate by popping a few tablets and partying at our already organised party. I believe that without E I never would have lived such a fully emotional filled life... disregard all the nasty things that I hear about the drug, just one look at my man and everything is left behind. I love him, and I love E

145	I was at this big celebration last week and lo and behold, someone handed me a capsule and proclaimed it was derived from Sassafrass root!
146	'Sassafrass!?, cool...that's my daughters name!' so I popped the capsule a prepared for the magic....
147	After awhile I was sure that there would not be much of a consciousness shift, but I was feeling good and staying open, and enjoying the band and the people.
148	BACKGROUND: On the way to the party I was walking with a woman who I had just met. She was an Israeli woman named Aviva, and is about 15-20 years my senior (I am 28). For some reason, i was feeling very open to her and during our walk, i revealed many
149	of the details of my personal life. One of the things I mentioned, was my past experiences with polyamory, and how that lead to the end of the relationship with my X-lover...I ended the conversation with...'that's why now we're staying pretty much 'monogomous'.....
150	I went inside for a drink, and i was standing against a wall, observing the people, vibes, etc, when Aviva walks up to me....
151	'FRee, excuse me, I don't mean anything by this, and I'm not sure, but I think there is something missing from your story'
152	'Well....where does Clay fit into the picture?'
153	Bingo. She is a very observant woman...though Sophie and I claim 'monogamy', it is really because we are very cautious. Clay is a close dear friend who is helping us raise our child and is, in essence, our lover....
154	I said, 'We snuggle with Clay alot, and he sleeps with us sometimes, we have another friend like that name Cosima...she and Sophie like to kiss alot : ) '
155	Those words were so sincere, and we looked deeply into each other's eyes. After a good few seconds of connecting, I naturally dropped my gaze.....
156	'You cannot look in my eyes for more than a few seconds?'
157	'I think I can' (gazing begins again), 'it can be scary'...
158	WOW....we stayed there in each other's eyes for what seemed like an eternity!! I have always been a big fan of eye contact....but this was ridiculous....it was so intense I couldn't believe it was happening. Soon only her eyes remained and her face was changing shapes and sizes.....and then WHAMMO....
159	'You know' she said, 'When you stare into someone's eyes like this, their face will begin to change, and you will see different faces, and different people, and they are the faces of history, and they are the different faces of ourselves, and some of them are even alien creatures...'
160	I was seeing 'em all! This was incredible!! Here she was giving me the most powerful tool i have encountered for connecting with people....in alot of ways it's better than sex!! (of course there is always the eye/sex combo).
161	'Let me tell you', she said, 'I feel that this is some kind of Initiation....not of me initiating you, or you initiating me, but it IS some kind of initiaion..'
162	After a minute or so more, we finally broke contact...it had been a good half hour of gazing and I was so thrilled and rejuvenated I had to go a boogyin'!!
163	Sometimes it's clearly the set and setting and not the dose that gives you the experience : )
164	P.S. I've done this looking thing several times since then with no chemical catalyst and it works great.....also...if any of you have not read the book 'The Little Prince' try it out, Aviva recommends it. : )

167	I use a very low dose (40-50mg) a night, if I take more, I take a second dose 1 hour later than my first. This keeps me going all night, and the come down is as good as none. First of all, I recommend this to all users: Learn to take small doses. You can get just as ecstatic EVERY time you do it! My friends do as I, and it works for them to!

169	I have a million of these stories, none of which I'm too particularly proud of, but this one above all others stand out. I will never forget that night....
170	Friday night myself and three college buddies decide to go check out this new rave club called 'Velvet' that just opened in downtown Austin, TX. Now, my friend of importance here is named Joe. As the norm, we indulged in some ecstacy that night.
171	11:00 Myself, Joe and my other two friends each took our first tab as we were driving down to 'Velvet'
172	11:15 We arrive at the club and start to roll during our long wait in line.
173	12:00 We finally get in. Joe finds a women that catches his eye and wanders off to go talk to her. Me and my other friends start trying to devise ways to obtain alcohol from the bar (being we were underage). At this time we were just starting to feel the effects of the ecstacy and decide the best course of action is to walk up to people 21+, hand them our money, and ask them if they would mind buying us drinks
174	1:00 Being that everyone else was rolling as well people were more then happy to oblige to our request. Joe is nowhere to be found.
175	2:00 After about an hour of drinking and socializing with various other party goers,I pop another tab and hit the dance floor with a girl I've been talking to for a while and proceed to get my boogie on, while my two other friends hang out at the bar. Joe is still no where to be found.
176	4:00 After what seemed like an eternity of dance mania I decide to call it quits, just before taking my last hit for the night. While I might have thought I was a good dancer at the time, in all reality I was just playing hop-scotch without moving forward. Again, Joe is nowhere to be found.
177	4:30 Joe is found! He comes running up to me excitedly explaining to me how he meet a girl and had taken a total of 5 tabs over the course of the night. By this time our other two friends were ready to leave and go back home. Joe asks us to give him 30 more minutes while he takes this girl back to his truck to hook up with. We agree, since this guy never gets any ass, and we see him run off towards the bar grab a girl by the hand and out the door. Mind you it was very dark and smokey in the club.
178	5:00 We stroll up to joe's truck and are spotted. We give him a few minutes to get his clothes back on and hop in the truck. I'm riding shotgun and my two friends are in the back. I decide to turn around and introduce myself to this girl after Joe says we are going to drop her off at her place on the way home. Now the first thing I usually notice about a girl are her eyes. In this case, it was her ADAM'S APPLE!!. Completly shocked and appalled I somehow manage to utter out the words 'How you doing?' In a deep shy voice he/she reply's 'Good'
179	5:10 The ride home is silent. I look back to see my two friends edgeing away from the shemale towards the passenger side door.
180	5:20 We drop 'It' off at her place and Joe gets it's number and gives it a kiss goodbye!
181	5:21 We can't hold it any longer and burst out in laughter explaining to Joe that abomination was a dude. He quickly protests saying 'That was a girl, I checked' To which I replied 'Then you just hooked up with your first post-op tranny!'
182	5:30 Joe drops us off at my place and before driving off says 'Ok, even if that was a dude, which she was not, don't tell anyone about it!'
183	And so ends 'The Legend of Joe' The moral of the story? 'If your bi-curious and want to keep it a secret, don't take ecstacy while out with your friends'

186	I had experience the pleasures of ectasy for the first time on Nov. 16. I had bought from a friend and had them tested for quality. I had took them at 5 AM on Nov. 16th. ME and my father were flying to arizona for thanksgiving with relatives. It didnt kick in till I got to the airport which was about an hour away. I felt like running through the airport hugging everyone I saw and wanted to know them. We had gotten on the plane and I asked to sit first class cause I was 'chlrostrophobic'.
187	Right before take off I had put on some trance like music and slowly closed my eyes and when it happened I felt like I was moving up 2 god, kissing the sky and riding on the clouds. The water was clear and I saw everything below it in perfect shape, the clouds slowly moved and started to perpetuate colors. I had closed my eyes once again because the high was so intense with the alittude change and I heard my name being called from all around I tried to call back out but no words were spoken.
188	The 4 hour and something minute ride felt like 2 seconds. The time lapse, which was 3 hours behind, had me confused as to where I was and why I was there. I had deboarded and ran through the airport trying to find my ride. An hour past when I finally found my ride and I hugged the limo driver, I was happy he was alive. The mountains in arizona were beautiful, flowing colors and the skyline was amazing. Later on to watch the sun set and bask in its glory I ate another pill and let the sun set. I realized that there was more to life then I have ever before. Everything was so clear in my life. It was the happiest hours of my life.

191	I saw visuals on both nights I took them(red rocket & yellow piranha). Then I saw visuals the night after I wasn't on them.(last night) I have yet to see how long this will last. I can turn things invisible.(easier in the dark) and faces are morphing.

193	Two very close friends and I were staying in a large rented caravan/mobile home for four nights at a small campsite in the New Forest area of England.  The village we stayed in is a tiny, picturesque location complete with a nice country pub and village green, which is occupied by a few wild horses during the day.  Despite coming here twice before, we still thought of ourselves as strangers in this small, isolated, rural community.  It kind of reminded me of old Western films where three horsemen would arrive in a small outback town, causing suspicion and edginess amongst the locals.  Except our horses were bikes  we were there to go mountain biking in the surrounding forest area, you see. 
194	Now Ive set the scene, lets get down to the fun part  the night in question.  We started the evening getting slightly drunk in the caravan and smoking a few joints.  We then headed down to the village pub where we proceeded to drink some more (Jack Daniels as I remember), and make acquaintance with the local laydeez of the village.  Once closing time came we all headed to a house party just down the road from the pub and somehow managed to blag our way in.  There was talk going round of a geezer hanging around outside selling ecstasy, and my friend and I wasted no time in obtaining some of these pills.  Once we had these pills in our hands we began to get quite apprehensive.  It was to be the first time for both of us but there was no going back now so we downed them and had some cheap wine.  Roughly half an hour later, the effects were getting quite noticeable for me and I had the sudden urge to start dancing like a maniac in the middle of the living room floor of this guys house who I didnt even know.  My friend at this point was in the bathroom doing I dont know what so I went into the garden for some fresh air and a brief sit down.  
195	There were some dogs in the garden running around in an enclosed fenced area, and I was getting bored waiting for my friend still in the bathroom, so I decided to feed the dogs.  This involved me carrying armloads of canned dog food from the fridge inside out into the garden to hurl into the dog area.  And this is where it all started to get a bit surreal.
196	I remember making my way out into the front garden of the house and seeing a police car pull up outside.  This brought on a sudden, intense wave of paranoia in me and being the first person he saw, the police officer strolled up to me and started asking questions about noise levels, shouting, things like that.  I blabbered my way through this interrogation with some ease and the officer went inside.  At this point the paranoia really started to creep in.  I had a feeling that everyone was looking for me, for punishing me for every bad thing I had ever done in my life.  Although this might sound like a bad trip to you, I was actually enjoying it as I felt like a James Bond character  everybody looking to kill him, but always staying one step ahead.  The adrenalin rush was like no other I had ever experienced.
197	I was feeling overwhelmed by all the action and so I went back to our caravan alone to get some more weed to mellow me out a bit.  I did this ok but upon returning to the party I decided not to go back in but to head opposite to the village green instead, and watch the action from a safe viewpoint all by myself.  I sat under a tree in total darkness and began to roll and smoke a few joints.  After two joints I remember babbling incoherently like a fool and I must have collapsed or something.
198	I awoke and looked at my watch  it was 5am.  I headed back to the caravan where my friends were fucking around with the TV set or something and I sat down calmly.  I then burst into a full rendition of most of my favourite songs and went to bed.  The singing was especially satisfying as I was feeling like a rock star or something, and that was good.  I like singing when Im wasted anyway.
199	So thats that.  The next day I didnt feel too bad, didnt have a hangover, felt quite good actually, but a bit sick.  Im surprised I can remember so many details of this night but it was all good, like a chapter out of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

202	I'm writing this to share my expirience 'rolling' with some really close friends.
203	My first time rolling was good, I took one pill, to see what the drug felt like, and I liked it.  My second time is when I got the full spiritual and physical expirience of MDMA.
204	I'm not an avid drug user, I do nothing more then smoke pot and drink occationaly.  I have never tried ANYTHIGN else.
205	My friend D was able to get ahold of some assumed really good pills.  I was told they were old school 'White hears with pink specs'.  We used a  ez-test kit, black in 1-2 seconds, very impressive.  This indicates a high ammount of MDMA.
206	Lets rewind to the preview week.  We decided to stock up on some things to be ready for the weekend.  I suggest EVERYONE wanting to roll their first time do this, to be safe, and get the most out of your roll.  Here is the shopping list.
207	5HTP - Can be found at most vitamin stores - Replenishes a chemical in your brain called Seratonin.  This is the chemical used by MDMA to enduce the feeling Extacy gives you.  Take 2 a day for a week or so before you roll.  Then take another 4 3-5 hours before you roll, 1 WITH every roll you take, and then another 2 3 hours into your roll.  This will help you get the full MDMA expirience.  Trust me, it will be worth it
208	Magnesium - Can be found at most vitamin stores - Take 1 an hour before you roll to reduce Jaw Cleching!  This works, enough to where I didn't even notice how mild it was.
209	White Flower Oil - Can be found at most herbal stores and oriental markets - Drop a couple drops in a 100% cotton rag, and inhale it with some friends, very nice feeling.
210	A couple Vicks inhalers - Pretty much same feeling as white flower oil, although the white flower oil seems to be MUCH more intense.
211	Lots of glowsticks in different varities.  I prefered the 15 inch glowsticks my friend was able to get ahold of. Although the standard 4-6 inchers are great to learn on, although I learned on the 15's =).  The trail you will see later on in the roll are amazing.  If someone knows how to use them right, you can BLOW UP from these easily(more on this later).
212	LOTS OF WATER - YOU WILL DEHYDRATE without you even feeling it.  Drink a glass or 2 every now and then, more so if your dancing and sweating alot(I sweat a SHIT loud, we'll get to that later.)  I prefer to keep a nice zephrahills bottle in my back pocket while dancing, to have easy access.  Make sure the water is easy to get too, otherwise while rolling/dancing you will not want to stop.
213	Marijuana - If you don't smoke it, don't start, but being an avid weed smoker, it hightend my roll, and even brought it back a little when it was dying.  Plus its something to do while waiting for the roll to kick in, you usualy want to keep your mind of it.  I wouldn't want to get TOO stoned though.
214	Eat a lite meal a couple hours before you roll - You will roll more comfortably on a stomache with SOME food, not alot, just eat a small sandwich or something.  Drink some gatoraid.  YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EAT ON A ROLL, everyone I know can't eat while rolling, or a little after, so DON't ROLL on an empty stomache.
215	With all of these preperations lets get to the night we rolled...
216	I rolled with a small group of 8 people.  All really close friends, that I trust.  This is the best way.  Raves are nice, but small house raves of 5-20 close people that you know are the best, you will see why when you roll =)
217	We poped at around 10:30pm.  I started with one pill with intension on popping a second one later.  Smoked some weed while waiting, had dance techno going, and prepaired the glowsticks in a nice open space for dancing.  LOUD music is key ;)
218	Started to feel it a little at 11:00pm, these rolls were good, as even all of my friends felt it, most of them being expirienced rollers.  Started to break the glow sticks.
219	Now im a pretty big guy, as in, a little chubby, 5'11' 220lbs.  I'm more of a metalhead and love music.  I really like techno, but never appriciated it as much as I did after that night.  I never liked dancing, and never really have.
220	Around 11:30 it was hitting us pretty hard.  Just enjoying the great feeling, and having great conversation with my friends.  Everything is PERFECT, there isn't a thing in the world I would change at this moment.  I feel very energized and ready to do anything.  Just enjoying life and everything about it.
221	Midnight - We are all getting the full effects now, and I decide to take my second along with my friends.  We smoked a little more pot(doesn't take that much to hit ya while rolling, its really a nicer high too) and my friends began to rave a little as I watched and enjoyed.
222	12:30am  THE BLOW UPS BEGIN!!  If you've never heard of this, people can do things to you while rolling that will make you 'Blow Up'.  This feeling is AMAZING, and if someone who knows what they are doing makes you blow up, then the results are Life Changing.  I will get to my BIG BLOW UP later, when my second roll is starting to hit hard.
223	1am - I can feel my second roll in almost full force now.  I can't stop moving.  The feeling is amazing, I love life, and everyone with me.
224	1:30 am, My friend C stops by just to blow us up.  I'm first.  He informs me of what he is going to do in explicit detail.  He asks me to relax sitting on the couch, laid back a little bit.  He informs me that he is going to have me inhale the Vicks into my left notral, then right nostral, then he is going to blow it in my mouth/nose.  He then told me to hold in the last BIG inhale, and then placed his hands on my throat and asked me to 'Trust him'.  He told me to grab his arms as HARD as I could and lay back.  He cut off my air.  The next thing I knew all I heard was techno music.  Everything was black, I could see I was somewhere peaceful.  It began to come in clearer and clearer.  I was in a state of bliss.  I was in another place i've never been before and never wanted to leave.  My chi and I were one, my spirit was with me forever.  I was under for a good 5-10 minutes before I realized I was back in my friends appartment.  My roll was ready, and so was I.
225	2:00am - This feeling in my won't go away.  I HAVE to rave.  I cracked 2 15 inch glowsticks.   KEEP IN MIND I have never raved before.  My friends couldn't believe how well I did it.  I couldn't stop, I just wanted to dance.  All I could see was the glowsticks, and all I could hear was the music, louder and clearer then ever.
226	2:30am - I was stopped by C.  He was leaving and wanted to know If I wanted to be blown up one more time before he left.  Of course I agreed.  He told me to stand in front of the couch.  He now took a white flower oil soaked wash cloth.  I took one big inhale, he told me to hold it, he picked me up and wraped both arms around the bottom of my back, and rolled his intwined fists up my spine, cracking every bone in my back.  Away I went, into my place, almost as hard as before.  I awhile, chris was gone, and I spotted my glow sticks.
227	3:00am - I took a third one.  This was not planed, I was only going to take 2. but the third one went down.
228	3:30am - Non stop raving, and I was sure to keep alot of water in me.
229	7:00 am, roll is coming down, time to go home.
230	Brought all of my friends home.  Went home, and took more 5HTP, about 3, and tried to sleep.  Finaly got to sleep around 10:30 slept til 5am.  Woke up feeling more refreshed then ever.  It HAS to be the 5HTP because my first time I was completely useless the next day or 2.
231	Rolling is a great expirience, but should only be used SAFELY and RESPONSABLY.
232	I plan to roll in the future, but not for another month or so.  Spacing your rolls will keep you safe from any long term effects.  Just don't do it too much.  Save it for special occations and it will be more enjoyable.

235	I have been having horrific nightmares in the nights following ingestion of MDMA. I want to warn people of these night tremor side effects. They are terrifying me and my friends. 
236	The first time I had a nightmare I dreamed this: A green and brown crystaline tree grew out of my bedroom window and the branches started to grow through the window. At first it was beautiful and fascinating. It turned ugly when the tree branches wrapped themselves around my neck, choking me. I started screaming for help but I couldn't talk. My voice was paralyzed.
237	Then I woke up and the tree was still there! I only dreamed that I had woken up, so I thought the whole thing was really happening!!!!  Finally after being almost strangled to death, I did wake up and I was so disturbed by this that I was afraid to go back to sleep. 
238	I have since had another dream with similar characteristics and so have 3 of my friends. I was sleeping next to my boyfriend the next time it happened, and when I woke up from the nightmare, I looked at him and he was shaking and jerking in his sleep. I woke him up and he had also been having bad dreams. They are similar: somebody or something is trying to hurt you or kill you and you think you wake up but your're really still sleeping.
239	I felt like I was in some weird Freddy Krugger type dream thing, where you need to have somebody watch you when you sleep and when you start freaking out they need to wake you up. This happened to me and my friends, always in the nights after ingestion of MDMA.(but not during use of the drug, it's like the day after the day you take it.)

246	It was New Year eve and I had come home from college.  While I was gone, alot of friends got into the club scene and knew a club owner who was keeping the club open afterhours for people he knew.  After taking one at about 11:00, chewed the pill per a friends insturctions to get it going harder/faster - and it tastes like shit.  Imagine chewing asprin - just worse, and it was a hard taste to get rid of.  It took an hour to kick in, it was about midnight.  
247	It was like a sudden wave of feeling perfect.  I was sitting on these leather couches and all of a sudden I just felt completely open to everyone.  I got talkative, energetic, and suddenly interested in being touched.  I saw this girl with a little vibrating white bunny.  Completely unlike myself, I just go sit down with her and her friends, start taking to them, and talking her into massaging me and rubbing her bunny on my head and face.  Nothing could match the way I physically felt.  I was clear headed, but every sense was x10.  I could feel the bass, I was in a trance to the music, any completely touchy-feely.  I would have been completely content touching everyone and everything around me.  Normally, I am not a smooth person and have some difficulty interacting with complete strangers - that completely changed.  Suddenly, people who I didnt know, I could just feel at home with.
248	And being around friends- it was really moving.  After talking, about things that would never normally come up, I suddenly realized what true friends I had.  Things like, 'You know, I dont thing I ever told you but I...[miss you, thought of you, was worried about you, would have felt so bad if, etc].  After that night, I knew exactly who my true friends were - it was a startling discovery.  I always thought of them as friends, but never as the people who would take a bullet for me.  And it took that night for me to completely realize this.  And I was so excited and energetic after realizing this- that alone would have made my day.  But it was soo much better becuase of how I felt from the roll.
249	And I have never been a real dancer.  Cant keep beat - and I never danced in clubs out of fear of just being one of those people that you just laugh at and say, 'why is that person out there??'   Guess what, that changed too.  At one point in the night, I was dancing with my friends girlfriend in the middle of the dancefloor, dancing like it was my job.  Completely into the music, just flowing through me
250	At 4:00AM, I took a second pill.  Picked me right back up.  Around 7:30AM, I started feeling a like I was going to puke.  We left at 8:00AM and at a stop light, I opened the door, puked, and was fine.
251	I am a better person because of it.  Somehow, I just had a different outlook on things after that.  It may sound fake or stupid, but it was almost like how people who have near death experiences are changed and have a new outlook on life completely.  I felt like I knew so much more about myself after that.  Regrets : none.

254	I did not really have a question, per se, but I wanted to give you some information that might be helpful.  I have had many experiences with pure MDMA.  One thing that I have noticed is that if you take 100mg doses about 2.5 h apart, and you do this three times, by the time the third one hits you you are hallucinating.  I did not think that MDMA was like this.  In fact, I have also done pure LSD and mescaline and I have never seen stuff like I do with this MDMA experience.  LSD and mescaline give color shifts and trails.  I was actually seeing things on dose 3 of MDMA.  People walking by that were not there, faces change from the person I knew into someone else.  Do you guys have an explanation for this?
255	Also I was reading your 2-C-B entry.  One person reported thick mucus build up.  Whenever I do alot of MDMA I get this thick mucus the next day, and I have trouble eating all the next day.
256	[erowid note: A minority of ecstasy users report strong visuals, from patterns to imagery to hallucinations.  These usually accompany higher dose sessions.   See also Liechti, Gamma, Vollenweider's paper which gives side-effect profiles.]

259	   I am 39 years old and have avoided drugs, save for times smoking pot and one line of coke about 15 years ago.  People assume that I so conservative that I would freak out over any drug use.  
260	   My business partner and I have been very close friends for many years. He is 29 and far more liberal than I.  Last June he began several conversations about ectasy.  Because of my responses - 'anyone would have to be nuts to fool with any of that stuff' - he dropped the subject.  Following several more attempts to introduce the subject, he finally admitted in September - 'Don't flip out' that he tried MDMA.  He also convinced me to at least try it.  I did.  Like many the first time was terrifying, 'Oh God, why did I agree to this?'  Vomitting, total lack of control.  I now realize that the discomfort was caused more by anxiety than by the drug. My partner never left my side, even when I had my head in the bowl.  He was very reassuring.  Since that time we have been partying about every two weeks.
261	    The experience has relaxed me and had a positive change on my overall attitude.  I have witnessed girls exhibiting bisexuality in clubs & at parties.  Within the past two months, my partner & I, both straight and married, have become physically closer.  Two weeks ago while our wives were aways we went 'skinny dipping' and ended up achieving erections.  There has been no oral contact, just touching.  Neither of us are awake of homosexual tendencies when not rolling.  Now there seems to be a whole new element to partying. It feels good, it's enjoyable, there's no shame even though it's not discussed when sober.  I have no sense of switching sides, we just enjoy the experience.  I'm wondering if I discovered a side of me that I didn't know existed or is it just an extension of the touchy-feely nature of MDMA.  In the past we have shared girls, but this is new.  I am a very secure person and confident of who I am.  While I wouldn't share this with associates, I thought it may be helpful if someone else has a similar experience.

264	Last Satruday night I was left to my own devices and ended up at the biggest gay dance club here in San Francisco.  I was there the weekend before with a friend and had a blast (consuming only beer).
265	As usual, the line was quite long.  I struck up a conversation with the guy in front of me who turned out to be an E dealer.  The next thing I know, I was buying a tablet from him for $20.  I had only done E one other time, about 16 months ago, but this would be my first time doing it a giant club.  I swallowed the pill around 11pm and waited...
266	45 minutes later, while out on the dance floor, the feeling of euphoria took over me and I was hearing the thumping club music on a whole new level.  I had been dancing with a group of guys who were already tweaking and I was now on their level.  We danced hard, rubbed each other and kissed.  It suddenly dawned on me that just about everyone in the club was on E!  I couldn't remember a better time dancing and every song was my favorite song for the 7 minutes it was on.
267	I took several breaks to walk around the club and rehydrate.  Just the simple act of bumping into people touching them as I walked by was incredible.  At one point while returning to the dance floor, someone grabbed my arm.  I turned around and it was a cute, buff shirtless guy and he said hi.  We started talking and my normally shy nature was nowhere to be found.  The conversation flowed so smoothly.  We went out and danced and kissed.  Kissing must be my favorite thing to do while on E.  The feel of his tongue on my lips was incredible.  I asked if he was on anything and he said he wasn't.  I was a little bummed, because I wanted to him to be on the same level as me.
268	We went upstairs to the lounge to chill and I was the most talkative I had ever been.  Unfortunately, he was getting tired and wanted to go home.  He invited me over and I had to weigh the options of staying at the club and continuing my E adventure, or going home with him which would mean I wouldn't have to drive an hour home.  I opted to go with him.  
269	Back at this place we smoked a little pot and tried to have sex.  Maintaining an erection was next to impossible, so it just wasn't working out.  After a restless night sleep, we tried to have sex, but I couldn't come to save my life.  I spent the rest of the day at home, recovering.  I love being on E...I just wish the next day wasn't so bad!!

272	I have taken ecstasy about 10 times in a number of environments and I feel a loss of magic in the drug.  I remember the first time I took this drug, I was overwhelmed with emotions I have never felt.  It was unbelievable.  But now, its nothing special.  I think it is because i learned to control my roll.  I know how to handle it now.  
273	Before, ecstasy took me over.  I couldn't control myself.  Now, after the 10 times I have rolled, I'm not overwhelmed anymore.  Its nothing special now.  Another factor is the crash.  I feel SO AWFUL after a night on ecstasy that I think I would be better off not even taking it.  As soon as the peek ends, I feel drained of all energy.  I am usually depressed for the next 3 days.  Ecstasy isn't even worth taking for me anymore.

276	I usually start about 11pm. The 1st couple of times trippin were just 1/2 hits. I dont remember any hangover of any type.I think I started having the hangover effect when I got up to 2 in one nite. And when I tripped both friday and saturday, Monday I'd be half dead. real easy to pass out, very weak,could only lie in bed all day
277	I started taking 5 htp to ease the hangover, and then to extend the rolling (peaking). Then I got this vitamen mineral mix for people who do recreational drugs, it's called neuro clear. It seems to help alot.
278	Now I'm up to 5 in one nite, the next day your still tripping, But it ain't no fun at all, because of the physical hangover. I also been getting these canker like sores on my tounge, I think it could be the 5 htp, a friend gets them too, but only since he started the 5 htp. or we were thinkin that it could be from chewing on our tounges.
279	I can't see doing it as much in the future because i'm 46 years old its so bad afterwards, and it costs so dam much.

282	It was a lazy early spring Sunday.  One of those cold and wet days where the only option is to find something to do indoors on your day off work.  After waking up early--any time before 10am is early for me--my friend and I decided we would go do some spring clothes shopping.  We had a trip to California coming up in a month but we had no spring clothes.  My friend (I'll call him Yakko) was one of those kinds of shoppers who will go into the same store 15 times but never find anything he likes, so I knew it was going to be a long day.  Feeling up to a challenge that day, we decided we would take some MDMA along with us to consume before setting out on our shopping excursion.
283	It was about a 1/2 hour drive to the mall, so we dropped the pill at about the halfway point, in hopes that the roll would set in shortly after arrival.  We were set with our bottled water and credit cards and set off towards a few clothing stores.  The onset begain shortly after taking the pill, I chewed mine, Yakko swallowed his.  In about 10 minutes I began to feel mild euphoria, and my pupils began to blow.  In the time it took to walk from the entrance to the restroom, the initial rush set in.
284	I do not recommend allowing yourself access to any form of credit card or ATM. Yakko, who, as I said, was the type of shopper that could spend 2 hours at a mall and not purchase a single item, suddenly became impulse shopper extraordinaire, buying 8 shirts, 9 pairs of shorts and countless accessories.  I, on the other hand, headed directly for Brookstone, with its countless gadgets and contraptions.  About 45 minutes had passed since consuming the dose of MDMA, and I begain having visuals, an experience that I had not endured while under the influence of MDMA previously.  Shopping at this point became, well, not only pointless, but impossible.  Yakko was unable to sign his signature on a receipt for a purchase.  After a peculiar look from the sales clerk, I had to fraudulently inform her that Yakko was epileptic, and he was having a mild hand seizure.
285	We spent the next 3 hours wandering aimlessly around the megamall, unable to drive home, or even find our way to the car.  This left me reason to suspect there were some adulterants in the MDMA.  The batch is known as Cookies and Cream.  It was a rather small pill and the appearance is white, with brown flecks and no noticable picture.   My moral of this experience--get an MDMA test kit, and never try shopping while on Ecstasy.

287	i first tried ecstasy at a friends party in May of 2000, and i had the best time of my life. When the X started kicking in, we smoked some cannabis, so the full effects of the X were cloudy. I didnt seem to notice that things were more 'beautiful' as people say, but the touch and hearing senses were greatly magnified. the total peak effects were about 3 1/2 hrs, then the come down. The next day, i didnt have the mdma hangover, but i did obssessivly want to do it again. in about a week the want for X had diminished, but i did want to do it again. 
288	I recently rolled X again at a L.A. rave, but this time i didnt smoke cannabis, and its a total different experience! Nothing was clouded, everything was 'beautiful' every person who walked by was beautiful, every light, the music, everything. The experience wasnt as long as the first one (peak effects lasting around 3 hrs, probably due to dosage, and purity), but the experience was extremely better. the problem was, i had the mdma hangover the second time around. the day after i was ok, but the second day after, was the most depressing day ever. i was crying all day, most of it was over nothing. when i did have a reason to cry, it was because i wanted to do X again. Even though the after effects are sometimes harsh (depression etc..), X is still my drug of choice.

290	MDMA (3) : Various (28), Depression (15), Addiction & Habituation (10), General (1)
291	It was a Friday night and a male friend of mine picked me up from my house (about 7pm). He said that we were going to go to a small fast food place to 'pick up' - which ment get E - . I had rolled about 2 weeks before that and had had a good time, so I decided to prepare my mind for a really clear X-perience. I tired to expell all negative vibes in my body by tensing up differnt parts of my body and relaxing them in about 10 seconds. I went from head down to toes while I lay in the car seat in reclined position. I felt very at ease. 
292	We got to the place and another friend (female) was there to meet us. She had high-quality marijuana and we smoked it in the parking lot in the car while waiting for the delivery (about 7:45). I felt a strong 'head-change' and was more aware of the music we were listening to. It was trance (a kind of techno) and all the different patterns were getting noticed in my mind one by one. I sat enjoying this for about 10 minutes. I got my small pill and took it with a gulp of water. I knew we would be off on our adventure, so I prepared myself with a big bottle of water, glow sticks to keep me entertained in the car, and a binky (pacifire) because I tend to get really bad lock-jaw at my peak. 
293	A girl that I had never met before, but is a good friend of my male friend who was driving came along. The people who were on E were my female friend, the girl and myself. The new girl sat in the back with me while I waited for my pill to kick in. We all decided to go to this rave where there were supposed to be really good visuals. About 15 minutes later, I started to feel very relaxed and at ease. All the problems of my past week drifted away and the muscle excersises I did previously made my muscles relax. This was at about 8:15 or so. The music in the car had a really strong bass line and the vibrations were going into my hands that were on each side of me. A kind of undescribable 'traveling' sound was coming up louder and louder in the music as if someone was falling in a tunnel. As soon as it reached the climax of that song, I started to feel really strong vibrations going up my spine and into my brain. It felt like someone was 'plucking' my brain and it was wonderful. I looked over to the girl I had just met next to me and I realized how beautiful she was. I am bi-sexual, but I had never really acted upon any feelings I had for other women. I closed my eyes and put my head down on my knees. I really enjoyed the feeling of my head against my knees as if I was menting into pure love for this girl. 
294	(about 8:45) We get to the rave and there are kids every where. I felt like some one pulled some strings in me up like a marionette and I was AWAKE. I stepped out of the car and the earth beneath my feet made me feel very 'at home' as if I was a child re-born from mother Earth's womb. My female friend and I walked ahead of everyone else (due to having so much energy). We talked about how much we loved music and I realized that I had a very strong bond with her. She made me very happy and I gave her a big hug. I felt very content with it and almost sisterly. We stepped into the rave scene and i felt like I had just walked though a time-warp. The music made me very happy to be alive. I took the girl I didn't know by the hand and we went to dance. I don't think I had ever had such a fun time dancing. I didn't care how others thought of me, nor did I care who they were, where they came from, what they wore, etc. I danced with this girl for about an hour and a half straight untill my muscles were telling me to stop. The girl and I went down strairs to the chill-out room where some really phat trance beats were playing. They had these beautiful visuals projected on the screen of peoples eyes. I then looked into the girls eyes and they made me want to dive into them because they were so deep and green. I felt strongly connected to her so I took her hand and put it to my heart for her to know that I am alive. We talked for about half an hour (it's about 10 pm now) about the most amazing things. I felt my mind swell with knowledge about her. She told me that she felt close to me and so we kissed for a few minutes. It felt like something foreign had intruded into me. But at the same time, it felt good, so I stayed. 
295	All 4 of us danced all night and had a lot of fun drawing with markers all over us and sniffing vicks. The markers where like answers to my questions in life. As if everything is too serious, and I need to return to my childhood. I felt at home with this girl in my childish state of mind. Everything was simpler to think about and I felt like I floated away to a cloud. I had found my miracle.

297	My parents were taking me on a vacation to go see my grandparents in South Carolina, for a week, so I decided I wanted to do something the night before, kind of a going away thing with some friends. Well two friends and I asked a friend of my parents to take us to a concert at a club in RI (the show was all ages so my friends and I who are 14 and 15 got in no problem). I was already in a good mood, getting away from school for a week, and just had a lot of energy and a free feeling. I hadn't done E in about a month, so I was looking forward to it. 
298	I dropped the E (a small pink pill shaped like a stopsign) at around 6:45, when I stood up to get out of the car at 7:20, I had the floating happy feeling and I couldn't stop smiling. We were seeing Powerman 5000, so it was heavy, high energy music, and everyone was crowded in the mosh pit. By 8, the music had started and I was rolling hard, with all the bodies around me, it felt wonderful! I started playing with people's hair and jewelery, and had my pacifier there to suck on, though the beaded sting it was on got broken. everyone was smiling at me, I could see right into everyones head, it was as if I was best friends with everyone in there. 
299	I asked a guy to put me up to crowd surf, and let me say this, it was the greatest feeling of my whole life. Hands feeling me everywhere, holding me up, and just being thrown around gently everywhere. The only negative was that by the time the headlining band came on around 10, I was well over the peak of the trip and coming down, which made the rest of the show not that great. Next time I know I'll bring at least two pills, but I highly recomend the punk/rock concert atmosphere, as crowd surfing is AMAZING on E.

301	Here is a funny thing that happened to me on December 3, 1999:
302	I had purchased one tablet of ecstasy a couple of hours before I was supposed to go to my sorority's semi-formal. It was a rather small tablet, with faint spots, and no imprint to give me a clue to its possible name. (Its effects, I would later find out, were almost identical to another ecstasy pill I had taken a few months earlier named 'Kangaroo'.) I dropped just about 15 minutes before arriving at the dance's location in SOBE (at about 10:00 p.m.), and by the time we arrived, it had already begun to kick in a little. I waited a while and then, with the help of a cig, the roll kicked in full force.
303	It was fucking awesome. The feeling that spread throughout my body (and particularly in private areas) is impossible to describe, except for the fact that five minutes later, my friend and I had to leave because I thought I would no longer be able to contain my 'YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' of pure pleasure. What did suck was that I froze my ass off the whole time. We had taken a chartered bus to the dance, and the driver wouldn't leave because we were the only two people on the bus (even though the buses were supposed to make round trips all nite). We sat in the back of the bus, and I wound up curled up in the fetal position, feeling UNBELIEVABLY INCREDIBLE. I don't remember most of the trip home (after we convinced the bus driver that no one else would be coming for a long time), but my friend said I seemed in control and was talking (probably more like chattering) the whole time. It felt simply amazing is all I can say. 
304	Well, time to get to the funny part of this story. I visited various friends during the course of my roll, and was finally headed to my final destination (home) at about 4:30 a.m. When I had left my last friend's house, I thought the roll was pretty much over, but the ensuing shutter vision and zone-outs proved me wrong. Anyways, there I was, driving down a major highway, listening to trance and zoning out heavily, when I came to my intersection. I was sitting there in the left-turn lane for what seemed like forever, and when the green arrow came on, I made my turn. But what to my wandering eyes should appear, fucking COP LIGHTS right behind my ASS! I pulled over right away and was amazed at how relaxed I felt.
305	I knew I was potentially fucked, but I felt completely in control, even though the cop got out of his car so fast I didn't have time to check if my pupils were still huge. I turned off the trance, hid my vicks and glowsticks, and rolled down my window, still surprised a t how NOT terrified I was. The copper proceeded to quickly ask me detailed questions in rapid succession, such as where I had come from, what was the address, where was I headed now, and what was that address. 'Holy shit,' I thought, 'he thinks I'm drunk.'  This raised my spirits a little, as I was glancing warily at the flashlight in his hand, which he was using to take a quick glance at the inside of my car. It still looked bright as fuck to me, and I knew if he decided to shine it in my face I was finished. However, since his first assumption was that I was wasted, I figured he probably wouldn't think to check my eyes. Nevertheless, I was still scared to look him in the face for fear that he would be able to tell, even though my eyes are very dark, and I had not yet gotten my (lifesaving) colored contacts. (Get them, folks--they will save your ass plenty a time. You can blame anything on your contacts--red eyes, etc.) Anyways, after we had gone through the whole 'gimme your license and registration' thing, the cop (a guy, by the way) returned to the car and told me that he had pulled me over because I had swerved from lane to lane twice.
306	He said he had about three assumptions he could make on that--I was either drunk, switching the radio station or eating or something, or just plain tired. Well, since it was now 4:45 a.m., I played on the tired role. Well, it was practically dawn, wasn't it?! Well, this is the great part: as he was flashing his light in my window, he saw the tattoo on my ankle, which sparked a conversation that lasted one whole hour!!! I laugh to this day about that. We talked about everything under the sun, and you know how great coversations are when you're rolling. Even my jaw was still tight, and there I was, chatting it up with this cop who couldn't tell I was FUCKED  UP!!!!! In the end, he gave me a warning and let me go.
307	Although the events of that night were extremely funny, all of you out there should realize I was EXTREMELY lucky. If I had gotten an asshole cop, I could have gotten busted, and I have been told that if I am arrested for any reason, I may kiss my near future career goodbye (clinical psychologist). And let me tell you, one good roll would not have been worth it. So people, when doing any drugs, do not drive yourselves! If you are in the backseat of someone's car and they get pulled over, at least you can play drunk and the cops probably won't care too much about you anyway (unless you're under age--then you're fucked). Happy rolling! Peace Out

309	I've done E several times, and have experienced several diffrent effects ranging from the 'post coidal bliss' feeling to 'I can take over the world' feeling. My most joyus time however was second roll. and my only time rolling with friends. My buds and I slowly toked a beautifully colored glass bong at the home of a freind. Various people were crowded around the bar in the basement. The bong was on fire, and we happily talked as we exchanged hits. Thats when it hit me. The pill I had taken an hour earlier finally began to kick in. 
310	A note to consider, I am not the most talkative member of my group of friends, meaning I'm not the class clown or the joker member of the group which is always conversing and socialzing. I mostly just like to chill and enjoy their company. However, as the effects of the pill became apparent, I enetered a whole new world with these people I'd never experienced. Suddenly, I was the center of attention. I sat in the middle and began talking, began taking charge. Listening to every word with heart and undivided attention I quickly recived the attention of the whole household. Talking louder, I spoke with more confidence and emotion in my words and facial expressions than I had ever before all awhile being and feeling totally sincere. Everything that came out of my mouth was funny, smart, or inspirational. The awkwardness was gone. 
311	I started up funny and friendly conversations with people I barely knew, and would not have even talked to normally. I joked casually with girls I would have never had the confidence to even make eye contact with in the past I had turned from the quiet reserved Brian to the sociable, confident Brian I had always dreamed of being. I had a feeling of confidence I had never experienced. I felt like a million bucks. I took charge of the room, got the group talking, and planned a day of fun for us all, We went to the stadium and watched a game, all along, with me talking and telling it how it was. It was the most pleasurable day of my life. All the things I had worried about asking, and all the people who had intimidated me in the past were no more. Everyone was my friend. My fellow brothers and sisters. The awkwardness and fears conversing were gone. No more was I held back by low self-esteem. I was flying high, saying what was on my mind, holding nothing back. It was after a few hours of this bliss  I began to notice the drug starting to wear off. 
312	I felt a little depressed as the effects slowly diminished. I was losing the feeling of confidence and love I had felt just hours earlier. I slowly began to withdraw from the group socially, and by the end of the night I was sitting on the couch again in which I had sat earlier that day before the pill. Back to my shy, normal self. My friends could see it too. The funny fast talking leader I had been had faded. I was once again a listener, not a leader, as I chuckled at my friends jokes, trying to hide the fact that I was slowly slipping back to the drab normality. This drug is truely intense. 
313	It makes me wonder... What if we could feel this way all the time? Imagine the love, the freindship, the things we would get done. The confidence you feel with this drug is crazy. It literally makes you feel as if you had just won 10 million dollars. That warm funny feeling of happiness you get in your stomach when your getting married, going to pick up your new car, and the jittery anticipation you get when trying to sleep on Chritmas eve.. I have seen the light with this drug, and have thus posed the question: 'If it is possible to have these feelings, and feel these riviting emotions, why must we as humans rely on a pill for this. If we could feel this way, why do we feel normal, Why instead of feeling simply normal, can't we feel this great? Why do we have to experience the depression and pitfalls of our minds, if it is possible to feel this much more free. Imagine if everyone felt like they were rolling. Imagine all the worlds people with those kind of boosted feelings. Everyone happy, everyone confident, everyone loving. Imagine. It is possible, it is real. It's the mixing of chemicals in our brains. And because of this, I hope someday medical science finds a way to induce this feeling without causeing harm to the body. And when it is found, we, the people, will take this world to heights never before imagined. For you see, when your on 'E' anything is possible.

315	        I did some ecstasy on Saturday. I got it from a guy I work with.
316	It was a nice surprise! I bought a 'Full Moon,' or what was supposed to be
317	two doses. I'd gotten MDMA a few times in '89 and '90, but it wasn't that
318	strong... of course that was $8-10 and the Full Moon cost me $30. It was a

321	it started snowing then took the whole thing, at around midnight. It hit
322	me real slowly, and in about 1 to 1 1/2 hours I peaked. I spent an hour or
323	two curled up on the floor just thinking. I couldn't keep my eyes open
324	because the natural beauty and beingness of everything was just too
325	intense. The most mundane objects took on a new light, things were
326	beautiful simply by being what they were. A totally different experience
327	from LSD, mundanely beautiful rather than cosmically and intensely

329	snow that had built up to about 5 inches by then. The beauty of everything
330	in virgin snow with big fluffy flakes falling heavily... I can't describe
331	it. Heavenly. I finally fell asleep around 6. I awoke to a world changed
332	by snow and a self changed by ecstasy. Its left me with a sense of

335	I went to Cancun this past spring break (march 2000). I had done E plenty of times before this and had wonderful experiences.  I bought the E from these guys from chicago.  After buying it for me and a friend of mine I was warned by the person that I bought it from to only take half. Me thinking that I was a big shot ignored the advice. When I got on the bus to go to a club in Cancun I took half the pill. 
336	Within 20 minutes my entire body was tingling, I had never felt effects that quickly and I just figured that it was really good E and proceeded to take the other half. Needless to say, this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life.  After I took the other half I was bouncing off the walls with excitement.  This excitement lasted approximately 20 minutes.  
337	After this period passed I was filled with paranoia. I was sweating a lot, was unable to communicate, and was stuck in this club with nobody to bring me home.  I looked at my friend who had taken the same kind of pill from the same people and he was dancin away. I, on the other hand, was completely convinced that my life was going to end that night. I went in and out of this state of paranoia, but i would only stay out of it for about 1 minute.  Then, and this is the part that really freaked me out. A friend of mine who was sober asked me if I wanted to go back to the hotel and I said yes, but my other friend was also on E and could not be left alone. It was at this point that I yellled that I was going to kill myself (this is how strong the paranoia was), needless to say my friend grabbed me and stopped me and told me that he was takin me back to the hotel.  
338	I again said that my other friends who had taken the E with me could not be left alone, and I said that I would go into the bathroom to wash my face and maybe that would make me feel better. I went into the bathroom and tried to urinate but could not bring myself to stand still in front of the urinal. So I stopped tryin, then I went and splashed water on my face.  I then looked in the mirror and when I looked in the mirror the water was drippin off my face but I thought that it was my skin. This is when I realized that what I had taken could have been E mixed with something else. 
339	I began screaming that my skin was drippin off my face, and then i ran back out to the dance floor. Everybody was dancing away even my friend that had taken the same pill that I had. I saw one of my friends was not dancing and he saw the petrified look on my face and asked if I wanted to go back to the room. He has no idea what was happening to me cause he had been in another section of the club for the entire night.  
340	When we got back to the hotel I wanted to jump off the balcony but controlled my desire and ran back to my room and jumped into my bed. I finally felt a sense of calmness and lovingness (you know, the usual effects of E) and then I fell asleep. My friends said that when they got back to the hotel I was moaning for help in my sleep but they just check on me periodically to make sure that i was still breathing.
341	After that experience I always get paranoid and I am never able to dance. Until this weekend when I went to a club in New York City where I live (the club will remain nameless) and I took one pill and I was back to old self. I did not leave the dance floor once. I just danced and hugged and kissed everybody that I was with.  I think that my Cancun experience has finally left my mind and I can finally enjoy the feeling of complete XTC again.

344	The third time I tried XTC, I did it at my home with 4 other friends. The previous times I had done it with only my boyfriend. I planned on having a 'rolling party' while my parents were out of town. I took my pill when my boyfriend did, before my friends got there. When I was in my garage smoking a cigarette I suddenly vomited blue kool-aid all over the floor! I had never vomited from XTC before. However, this did not make the experience any less pleasent, I would say it made it even better! With vomit all over my face and clothes I looked horrible but felt wonderful. I walked up the stairs to the shower and I felt like I was walking throught Jell-O. The shower afterward was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced in my life. It felt like I was being enveloped in a warm soothing liquid blanket that made me feel safe. I returned to my friends who were now rolling in the garage. One was dancing to Lords of Acid and feeling her body all over. One was sucking on a pacifier. One was smoking weed, and one was just sitting there petting my cat.
345	I felt strangely physically attracted to my best friend of ten years. I asked her if I could suck on her nipples because I had the urge to. All of this seemed very confusing yet enlightening to me. I was sexually attracted to my best friend and I had never been before and probably never will again. My boyfriend and I were sharing with each other how much we loved each other and even considered getting married! *something that we would never have done sober* 
346	Eventually the peak of my XTC wore off and I was suddenly annoyed with having all these people in MY house.  They suddenly became annoying little flies that had to be shooed away. So I kicked them all out except for my boyfriend. After they all left, excluding my boyfriend, I felt much better and was even beginging to feel euphoric again. He and I engaged in oral, vaginal, and anal sex for about four to five hours, something never done before.
347	Then I eventually drifted into a deep sleep and did not wake up for another twelve hours. I felt groggy, irratible, cranky, and sleepy all day long.
348	Would I suggest XTC? yes. Is the 'hangover' worth the 'high'? That depends on what you have to do the day after you take it. If you have to work or go to school, then NO!!! If you can lay in bed all day, watch tv, and drink water, HELL YES!

351	I took X 10-15 times so far. each time i do it, i trip on something new except glow stix, those are always interesting to me). The first time it was all about lasers. after that i went deeper - touching, sounds (music, sounds around me, people talking,etc.), i went exploring beats and voices. I could listen to a song and separate each single sound it's made of. But last time i went raving, I had it all together. whatta feelin'. An incredible laser show, along with an awesome combination of disco lights, strobe lights, and fog. DJ playing some great beats. I had my best friends with me, massaging me, tripping me out with all kinds of lights. 
352	When I had my eyes closed i felt the music. I was the music. my friends were music. I loved music. With my eyes open, i loved my friends and even people around me i didn't even know. i loved the way everybody danced and how friendly everybody was. There were times when i would listen to music sitting down, and just go into a trance kinda feeling, and then when i snap out of it i would think just how much i love LIFE and X!! it's all about love. I felt like the whole place was one big love machine. it's ALL about love.

355	Well it all started when we (my friends and I) hit a club in Chicago; the club was great.  So we sat there for awhile and one of our friends came up to us and asked us if we were going to an after hours club in downtown.  So my friends and I decided to go and when we got up there were offered some rolls. We brought two pills each and took them before we entered the club. Well a good half an hour later I was rollin balls.  It was the greatest feeling I have ever felt.  My friends two seconds later asked if i was rollin cause he said he was rollin balls hard. It felt like everything was yours the world was made for you and that's that.  We stared at some glow sticks and tripped out on the lights for awhile and then one of our friends came up with a bottle of vaporub and put some under our eyes.  About 10 seconds had past before the roll hit three times harder. We couldn't believe it.  The roll lasted about 3-4 hours and then we went home about 10am cause the club opened at 5am. We had the greatest time of our life and we really prefer some x if someone could get some but BE CAREFULL WE CAN'T SAY THAT ENOUGH.

357	First off, whoever invented this shit--you one helluva person! My very first experience gave me the best feeling I had ever had in my life. I made sure I was prepared, so I asked friends who had done this before, and got a lot of advice. Number 1 thing---either get a whole lot of gum and/or a pacifier. You're gonna be chewing on ur gums right until you come down. Second--make sure ur around people you know, and have plenty of water. This shit makes u wanna drink a lot of water [and can also dehydrate people, so it's important to drink some water throughout the evening]. Most importantly, before you roll--do NOT eat, you will seriously get sick all over the place, and if you do get sick, you'll think its the roll and you'll never wanna do it again, when in actual fact ur missing out the best kinda drug there is! 
358	It was about 3 months ago that I rolled for the first time. I was really determined to try this drug, but never really got down to getting it. Soon enough I was overwhelmed by my curiosity and had to indulge in this thing called 'X-ing'. I was with a few friends, and they're practically all best friends, so I felt comfortable with it. Everyone around me also took the pill. It was Ash and mines first time--so we were really rolling face by the time we were 'up'. First we sat and relaxed-watching a tiny little black and white tv. I felt as if i was sitting outside of my body, that's how relaxed i was. I had my eyes focused so deeply into the tv, that everything around the tv was moving and swirling. My friend poked me as i was being so quiet, i was just so caught up in this feeling of relaxation. My friend looked at me and told me she was getting mad because she felt she had wasted her money because she wasn't feeling anything. We got up to go smoke a cigarette which sounded so good at the time. As we were walking down the stairs, i felt as if i was being carried down the stairs. My body was so light, it was crazy to think it was even me. Suddenly, Ash looked at me and just got this big smile on her face. Her roll had kicked in. 
359	We went outside and went and sat on the porch. I was so overwhelmed by the beauty of nature at this point, that i had smoked my whole cigarette already. It's amazing sitting and realizing that there's all this shit around you everyday, but you don't take notice of it all! You feel so confident when ur rolling, and trust me on this one--depending on who you are, you feel capable of doing anything--me--for instance, i was dancing in front of a group of people, not getting too hot tho, other wise, u don't feel that good. You feel so horny at one point, u can start touching others or ur self, or just something you love. Im known for hugging everyone when i roll. Im told im the cutest thing, and that of course sets me off when I'm rolling, cuz thats just another boost of esteem. The next day, I didn't feel in the least bit shitty, I felt good as hell. Honestly that shit is addicting, im getting ready to do some more next weekend. One thing, don't do it over a long period of time, other wise soon enough u'll be taking rolls and nothing will happen because ur body has not yet exported the roll. It is the best feeling. I try everything once, but this is one thing I'm going to do whenever I want to have a good time and just feel like the best thing in the world!
360	To all that haven't tried it, no pressure--but trust me, and other people who have done it, there's a first time for everything, and this first time will be the best time.
361	To all other raver's and people that roll out there---keep rolling, be careful, and most of all, I love all you guys!! :-)

364	I started raving after breaking up with a girl. I don't want to say this, but it was probably the e that got me out of my slump. When I first rolled, I saw the world in a whole new light. I just remember feeling sooo loved and euphoric. I soon forgot about my worries and sadness. That night changed me forever. I had never felt like I belonged anywhere as much as I did at the rave. This incredible techno music was tingling my bones and brain. People all around me were dancing, smiling, and hugging. It was beautiful. I became a party kid. 
365	For anyone who has raved, this is not an uncommon story. But just recently, I discovered somthing else about E. It can be more than a party tool. I dropped a gel cap of pure mdma (apox 100mg) about a month ago with my best friend from high school. This was his first party and his first time doing e. Ever since I had started partying, I felt as though I saw the world at a different level than Grant. We were drifting apart. But that night was incredible. When Grant started rolling, we became friends again. The tension between our diferences in ideology and lifestyle was gone. This roll wasn't about escape, sex, or addiction, it was about 2 people whose lives had diverged and was bridged by the surreal underground world. 
366	Ever since that time, I've viewed parties and rolling in a completly different light. Raving is about more than ditching worries and finding thrills; it's more about love. I've had so much more fun at parties now that I focus on the PEOPLE and not the drugs. E is amazing and I think everyone shoud do it some time in their lives. But I also think people should try partying sober. Be friendly and kind without any chemical aids. I admit it's not as fun, but the vibes you send will be out of the goodness of your heart and not cuz mdma made you do it.

369	So I am going to a rave and I have a big mac on me a type of MDMA or e. Well after waiting 3 hours in the line I get in. Once in I have no idea were my friends are and I cannot find anyone. So I think I will get happy by dosing so I do but I do a half just to be safe. Well I wasn't aware of the time it would take to kick in so I did the other half I thought nothing of and at the time I was alone and felt hungry I was not high yet so I said let's eat hot dog. After the dog it kicked and when it did I stood up I felt very light headed so went to go sit by a wall by myself. I had my watch on and it was it was 12:30 so I thought would sit for 5 minutes well I passed out  for 3 hours. 
370	By this time I was dehydrated and sketchin out and this was not fun. I was alone, scared and cold so I found my friends them being high to thinking that they were smart said chug water and don't stop. After that I felt more sick at the time I was walking around I was watching a big tv screen and below was a guy dancing then he fell off the stage and hit the ground and then they showed him on the screen. So I left. I went outside it was cold then thats when the hot dog came up for a visit. I got a ride home then once at home I could not sleep. When I finally left my room I felt that everyone was out to get me. Then for the next 4 days at school I still felt high and I felt there was still something wrong and now everytime I dose I only get a good peak then its over.

373	I had done Ecstasy for the first time 3 days prior to this one.  I was in Mexico on my senior trip ,and having the time of my life.  I had done E the first time at a foam party, so I thought that couldn't be beat.  Well I was wrong.
374	I had met this girl at the beginning of the week and was totally liking her.  It was my last day together with her so I wanted her to try X out.  She agreed and so I gave her a pill and told her that I would meet her later on that night.  When my friends and I got to the club we were rollin pretty hard andI really wanted to find her and see how she was.  When I finally found her she told me she was feeling pretty good, but I knew it really had not hit her yet.  We went and sat down on some couches and started to talk, about 5 min. into the conversation she told me she wasn't feeling well.  I calmed her down and told her to relax, I also reassured her that it was normal, and the drug was coming on.  She went to the bathroom and tried to throw up (I had one of my girlfriends in there with her), but she didn't and about 5min. later she came out and told me she wanted to sit down.  So I sat there kind of disappointed until this certain song came on.  It must of triggered her b/c right when it came on she looked at me with a big smile, and told me how good she was feeling now.  I was so happy about this.  I gave her a menthol cigarette (a must) and told her to dance for me.  She got up right in front of me and gave me a great, sexy dance.  Right then I started falling in love with her.  After a while we decided to go back to the hotel.  We went back and took some more (I took a h-bomb and I gave her a half of one).  We stared mesing around and eventully had sex.  Let me tell you it was the most intense sex ever.  The second pill hit me hard during this time and I was feeling numb.  Afterwards I decided to take a hot shower (let me tell you this was probably the best feeling I had ever had).  We then walked to the beach and layed in a lounge chair looking at the stars and listening to the waves crash.  I was now totally convinced I was in love.  We opened up to each other that night telling one another how we felt and how we hoped this feeling would never end.
375	Well I left a few hours lated, very sad, yet happy at the same time.  We saw each other again and it was awsome, we both still felt the same way.  However now it's all messed up.  We go to different colleges and haven't seen each other for a long time.  We still talk sometimes, but don't know what to do.  This is where E can cause confusion.  However I still wouldn't trade that night for anything!

378	The first time i rolled was at my christmas ball. It was definitely better than going to some club because all of my friends were there. I took my roll as soon as i got there and about a half hour later i just felt like talking to everybody. My date and about half my table was rolling to so whenever we sat down it was non stop talking about what was going on. I started drinknig water because everyone told me to but i didn't really want it. My advice is drink it anyway and have some gum. I was biting my face off which doesn't look good when 5 teachers are staring at you. So anyway, i must have danced to every song they played. I felt like i was completely insync with the beats and rythms. I was grinding with everyone. Even girls, but they knew i was on e so they just went along with it. I thought i'd be shaky and nervous but it was the opposite. I was completely relaxed and extremely happy. I just felt like my life was gonna get better. I was so optimistic. I knew i would do it again. And since then i've done it 4 times. But let me tell you, nothing can compare to the first time. The best part for me now is the very beginning and then about 2 hrs after. I have periods where i am extremely restless and aggravated and i just can't decide what i want to do. I feel like 'why did i even do this' and normal things irritate me. I feel like the world is just a bunch of shit and nothing is fun or worth doing. I get extremely angry when i think about going to school the next day or to work. I only want to be around people who are rolling. Don't get me wrong it's a great drug but just be careful with it.

381	i used to only do extasy with my boyfriend until i got invited to a rolling party. my best friend and i decided to go. we bought these tablets called ferrari. we both took one pill and started smoking some weed. after about an hour i started to feel the familiar rushing feeling. my stomach was turning and i felt that every time i moved i might get sick. there were candles everywhere and the heat was jacked up to 85 degrees. someone was dancing with glowsticks and there entire body dissapeared and all i could see was these incredible lights making wild patterns in the darkness. i glanced at my friend and she seemed to take on the body of a very fat person. she had double chins and filled up the entire recliner.
382	i decided that this drug was messing with my head and that i needed to concentrate on something but i was so trashed that i found it hard to do. i fell into an ehole which many people have never been in. i thought i had a ten minute conversation with this guy right next to me and when i asked him why he didnt answer me he said that i had not said anything to him at all. it felt like i had been in another body because i snapped back into reality and wondered where i had actually gone. then we took another pill.
383	i chilled and listened to music for a long time. then i looked up at my other friend and all of a sudden her face morphed into mine. it was very strange looking at my face on someone else's body and the other me started to talk even though i couldnt hear what i was saying. i kept closing my eyes and reopening them to see my friends real face but her face would not stop morphing. this was the coolest e i have had. i used to be able to morph peoples faces when i first started rolling but now its hard to even fall into an e hole because i have done it so much.
