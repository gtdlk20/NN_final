2	Every time I've done E I have had a horribly excruciating headache the day (and sometimes several days) after. I decided it was worth it anyway, after a couple times of use because I can only be open and honest when I'm rolling. About the fourth time I did E, everything was great until I started to come down (I was about two hours behind everyone else, so they were already asleep). I felt like I could never be happy again and I hated myself. I felt so lonely and hopeless that I just sobbed and cried for about two hours until I finally fell asleep. It was horrible. I still plan to use E again, and I am hoping that was just a one time experience, but it's not something I wish to repeat. I cried on and off for the next couple days for no good reason, too.

5	Basically the day after I've taking MDMA I feel quite drained and lazy, however I mainly put this down to the fact that when I use this drug it is very late at night and tends to run into the small hours of the next morning (6-9am).  
6	Also when I decide to call it a night I have great difficulty in getting to sleep, mainly due to my imagination thinking up the biggest load of crap which gets quite annoying.
7	The next day and days after I have never felt any depression, after I've gotten some sleep I feel perfectly normal.
8	I've been taking this drug on a regular bases from I was 17 and I'm now 22 just incase people wanted to know what effects it has over the years on a regular user.
9	Over all when the night is over and the sleeping is done, I feel quite normal, maybe dehydrated or chapped lips but thats the worst of my symtoms.

12	Alright, first off. I've been using speed for most of 2 years. I've tried just about everything thats readily available on the street. One day I'm talking to my friend (D) and he says he can get pink dolphins...So being the curious person I am I said hook it up, so his friend talked to me and I met him somewhere and picked up 2 pills. Got home took one and waited...then I cut some of the other pill and cut it up and snorted it..then decided to just eat it....After that it was shower time..I felt a little wierd but nothing specific..then I got out of the shower and noticed everything seemed very clear and warm...I went out to have a cigarette and thats when the fun began...life was just pouring into me, I could taste,smell,feel,hear and touch everything good in life. I finished my cig and went inside....everything felt fake,like I was dreaming..I never expected it to be like this. I played some guitar and I could feel the music, like the guitar was part of me, and it almost became too intense. Overall I feel one with the world...life is vivid and full...the world is my oyster and I'm about to slurp that sucker down

14	MDMA (3) : General (1), First Times (2), Alone (16)
15	First time using MDMA. Used about 350mg in a 6 hour timespan.
16	Effects were terrific euphoria at first, and a relaxed comedown after that.
17	Day after: still somewhat trippy, compassionate with others, unable to focus on complex subjects, restless, no appetite.
18	Day 2: somewhat restless, tired, limited appetite.
19	Day 3: appetite returned, somewhat 'down' feeling, dizziness and 'brain zaps', difficulty to concentrate on subjects requiring focus of mind.
20	Day 4: dizziness and brain zaps, other effects remained although lighter than before.

23	Alright so I peaked right, well I don't think my 'crash' is like most people's ya know?  It doesn't actually hit me until the day after the day.  I think it's because I roll late at night since I work until about 11.30 or sometimes 1.30.  So I roll late then the next morning (about 6) I'm starting to come down.  So it doesn't set in until a day after that.  My crash isn't as much of a crash as it is a numbness.  It's not that I feel bad, I don't feel anything.  I guess I appear to be in a bad mood since I don't really feel like talking to anyone.  The truth is that I'm not in a bad mood, I have zero mood....no good emotions no bad ones.  It's the most severe case of indifference ever...and it's really not all that bad.  I would say a hangover on alcohol is way worse...

26	Being no stranger to the wonderful world of esctasy, I finally did what had been suggested. I ground up 1 pill. Put it in a Plunger (the kind you put medicine in when your child is sick) Sucked in a little water, mixed the mixture up.  Put a little lube on the back door, carefully inserting the syringe about 2-3 inches in, and plunge. I only added about 3ccs of water. This is approx. 9pm 
27	Normally, e takes about 1 hour for me to start feeling it.
28	9:30pm starting to feel the come up. 10pm had 1 mixed alcoholic beverage.
29	10:15pm wow - Much more intense than I'm used to. 11:30pm Another Drink Please! Feeling Great! I have downed 2 bottles of water by this time.
30	Feeling awesome until the club closes at1:30pm. Head home, some a little weed and go to bed at 3am
31	All in all, I will do it this way again! very clean, no mess and wow, it was like taking 2 pills orally!

33	We had been preparing for my friend R's 16th birthday for about a month. We were all going to roll, some people for their first time. The party was planned entirely for an ecstasy trip. I couldnt wait until 7:00 (when the party started) so I crushed a pill after school and drank the powder. When taken this way it kicks in a lot faster and harder but lasts about 3-4 hours. I was still rolling when I got to the party, but I took another pill. I never dance, so I wasn't sure what kind of things I would do, but it was fun and I think I made an idiot of myself when I talked to people that weren't rolling. I had this really weird feeling of connection with this girl, B, I had never met. I haven't seen her other than at the party, but at the time she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. I was going to talk to her when R tells me he just asked her out. Immediately the thought of wanting her changed to being incredibly happy for them, but I was also envious of R. After dancing, I sat by the fire with R and B and we just talked about random things. I had a reason to be connected with R, who is my good friend, but I now realize I dont even know B. Sometime during the party, my friend A gave me a small dose of ketamine, which I snorted and got threshold effects. 
34	When I got home at 11:30, I crushed another pill and drank it. 7 of the 10 people that rolled were sleeping at my house. We all hung out doing random things and I snorted 1/4 of a pill. My dad came home with his girlfriend at 3:30, so they took 2 pills and I took another one. His gf crushed 2 pills and drank them at once and said she hadnt been that fucked up in 10 years. The 4th pill didnt hit me very hard even though I had taken the same one earlier, but I did feel a meth high. At 5:30, we came to the conclusion that there  might be some meth in the pills. An hour later we decided to snort 1/3 and GO TO SLEEP!! We were gonna go to sleep after snorting pills with meth in them and nobody thought it was weird. The three people who snorted the 1/3 never slept and the people who did only got a couple hours.
35	We were so fried the next day that we forgot what we were saying in midsentence and we couldnt follow thing that were normally simple but now seemed complicated.

37	There is a very important fact about crashing on mdma I would like to share with you! About a year ago when I first took mdma . After the initial (fantastic) feeling ended I began to feel dreadful. I sat in the corner in my friends apartment quietly as my two friends continued to dance as we had been doing for the last 3 hours. Suddenly I told them' listen , dont get me wrong , but I think I hate you guys'. One of my friends, who was very experienced with the drug, quickly said '  go right now and take a hot shower'. I at first told him no thanks but he insisted and said further that it must be incredibly hot, as hot as I could take. I proceded to shower and not only was the shower great but when I came out I felt my high had returned! It was less powerful than before but nevertheless back! It is the best cure against crashing and a shower every time I feel like I'm coming down hard will lead to a gradual and even pleasant fall from grace. Unfortunately this cure for crashes dos not keep away day after and week after hangovers from the drug, and I say that from experience.

40	I've been using MDMA on and off for 9 years now. Its an amazing substance.  In my quest for data, I recently measured blood pressure and body temp prior to dosing, and then T+1:30.  
41	None of this is surprising, just thought I'd share a data-point.

43	This year I decided to go to monster massive and before hand I got some capsules from a buddy of mine. He assured me it was pure MDMA and in my opinion I believe him. So we get inside and I take two capsules while my other friends took their pills in line. About an hour after getting there I start to feel it while I'm dancing, I feel a rush of energy to my head as I look around at the lights, they were so glorious and bright. I start playing with some glowsticks when they start to kick in, the glow sticks start to get blurry and I felt extreme euphoria. At one point while I was dancing I looked up at the stage and bright white light fell on me and I felt as if I was in heaven. I could not resist the urge to dance. About half an hour later I decide to sit down with my buddy who is stuck sitting down at this point in time and I can't help but talk to all the people around me. I was told I had a giant grin on my face although I had no idea until that point. As I'm sitting all I want to do is soak in the music and enjoy the roll. It felt extremely good to be touched by anything and I felt absolutely amazing. Then alittle bit later my jaw would be chattering up and down without hitting my top teeth, and I had absolutely no jaw clenching. Later on I danced and danced and just loved the music and people that I talked to. That night I slept like a baby and got up around 9 in the morning. I had no negative side affects through out this entire period.

45	MDMA (3) : Rave / Dance Event (18), General (1)
46	I spent about three days taking blue dolphins and other tabs.  The high was fantastic, but when it finally wore off, I became sad enough to kill myself.
47	The strongest feeling I had was that I was a terrible, worthless person, and that the world was sad and dirty.  I found myself pacing and crying and fidgeting.  I could not close my eyes to sleep, and I very badly wanted to be held.
48	My mind replayed every 'bad' or stupid thing I'd ever done, over and over, and I felt like I deserved to die.  
49	I found that taking a low dose of Prozac as I was coming down helped lessen my crashes.  I have clinical depression, so any break from my gloominess, like the one Ex provides, works really well.  When I'm depressed and coming out of a happy experience back to my sadness, I guess a crash is to be expected.
50	  Four tabs is a bit much for me, and after the second, the effects just aren't as strong.

52	While it may be that the substance described is pure MDMA, Ecstasy/Molly tablets and powders are notoriously impure, misrepresented, or adulterated. Ecstasy sold in retail contexts such as festivals or parties often contain chemicals other than MDMA.] 
53	First of all, I'm from Holland, 18 years old and you could call me a typical Dutch kid: the first time I smoked weed was at 12 years old and I didn't stop ever since. I knew, in the future, I was going to use drugs and when I was fifteen, after some online research, somewhere in june I had my first mushroom trip and it was great. We had dried shrooms(can't remember what kind)and I took about 5 medium sized ones. Since then I used mushrooms every one, one and a half month in summer and once every three months in winter(something like that). 
54	At the end of july I had my first XTC experience. Me and my ex-girlfriend both took one green 2000 tab wich I stole from my mother. I still think they had some MDA in it because I had some pretty funny visuals: I stood half naked in front of a mirror and while looking at my muscles I saw myself turning into a H-man type of character, wich was really surprising. The pattern on my girlfriends shirt changed and at some point we looked at eachother and we both saw sunglasses on our heads. Also the whole night it seemed as if the room was smaller(or I was bigger). The year after that we did it nearly every month but in a more easy way: never more than half a pill at a time and we just sat at home talking about our problems, analyzing and trying to solve them. The next one and half year I worked as a cook(40-50 hours a week) so we couldn't party to much. 
55	Then we broke up and since I used to live with her I suddenly was free to do what I wanted, and being without a job, that's what I did. I started doing pills every two weeks, sometimes with friends but to many times alone. And then new years eve came....
56	I was at a party in one of my best friends(I'll call him E) house and I had 3 pills with me, another guy had 2 and we shared them with four other guys. It was the first time for three of them and we had the best night ever. My parents gave a teKno(lotta noise) party wich ended at six o'clock in the morning, aftering at my parents house and we were all(me, my mother, stephdad and friends) fucked up. And it was great!
57	We did nothing up to two monts after new year, and then we started the fun times wich started with the experience I want to share with y'all. 
58	It was friday and we decided to have a party. There was a new phone number(...) so we called it and made an appointment 1 hour later. I gave the guy 20 euros and I expected to get about 8 or 10 tabs(normal price here) but after we meeted I looked in the bag and we got 20 tabs!!!! It were very large white ferrari horses and, as I was told, they were 110mg MDMA. Trying to be responsible we all took one half to start with. But after half an hour we took another half and than a whole one, an hour later. We were in the centre at a bar and we had a very good time. We left before closing time and we just started walking trough our town, smoking a lot of weed(a standard when were fucked up), running around doing all kinds of crazy shit.
59	I can't really remember the next two hours but my friends all went home at about four o' clock. I invited E to my home to smoke some more and to let the easy's wear of.  
60	My parent's house is great when your fucked up: there are 3000 cd's from aphex twin to buena vista social club, from the Wu to Bob Marley, there's a fire place with a matrass in front of it and I am allowed to smoke weed inside. The last pill we dropped was at two and we were still high as ever. So naturally(...) we took another half, rolled a joint, aphex twin in the cd player and kicked back on the matrass in the centre of the living room(we didn't lit the fire place) and just started talking. This was really difficult because every 10 minutes we forgot what we were talking about. I had really clear visuals like red stripes on a cd cover wich I looked at for a minute and after looking again disapeared. Also the ceiling had a zebra type of pattern wich was very similair to what the pattern on my exes shirt looked like. So now my question is: who's had green 2000 tabs or white ferrari's and what was in them?!  Could be a combo between MDA and MDMA or maybe it possible to get visuals from just MDMA.

62	MDMA (3) : General (1), What Was in That? (26), Various (28)
63	I recently had my first experience with Ecstacy, and it was life altaring.
64	It was about 8 o clock on a saturday night when I first took the pill. I was sitting in my friends room with friends play video games, chilling listening to music with blacklights and neon lights everywhere.  About a half hour passed and I didnt feel much different but I could tell it was coming.  About 9 o clock, it hits me hard, and I'm just sitting there listening to music and chilling.  I was the only one rolling so when everyone noticed me there were laughing and I just wanted to hug them all.  I started feeling like my friends were the best thing to ever happen to me.  About 10 minutes after it hits me,  we deicided to walk to the next town over and hang out with some kids.  So I got my Ipod. And started riding my bike.
65	I got about half way there and I saw like 20 of my friends all sitting in cars on my friends front lawn,  I went up to them and they all started hugging me and rubbing my head and this girl gave me this spinning light show for the ride there,  I was ridding down the rode listening to the gorrilaz and staring at the light show, and it was the most intense ride of my life,  I loved everything, I didnt care about one thing, all I cared about was my music.  I finally get there and we go to this fort in the woods,  theres about 10 kids there all just hanging out, smoking,  having a good time, I just got up and went out side the first and danced and ran around for an hour and it was so much fun,  I hugged a lot of people and it made me really happy.  Its now about 11 and we go back to my friends house to meet up with him,  I'm still rolling pretty hard.  We get there and I give him a hug and he says'Fuck you! I'm so jelous!' and we just laughed.  He turns off the lights and puts on an amazing playlist for the night,  and I just take my spinning light show and start dancing, I didnt care who was looking or how dumb I looked, all I knew was I was having an amazing time.
66	At about 11 30, I was coming down a tiny bit but still have the time of my life,at this point I started grinding my teeth, so my friend gave me some gum to chew on because he said thats the worst thing to be doing.  So at about 12 o clock everyones gone except me and two of my friends one passed out and the other with a joint in his hand, he comes up to me and says 'wanna go smoke this?'  so we go in his backyard and me and him are just talking smoking a nice joint having a really chill time,  at that point my roll started to come back because everything was just so chill and so easy going.  Everything went right.  At about 1 o clock I started coming down again,  I was coming down very smoothly and I didnt crash at all.  But I still felt like going out and having a good time with friends.  
67	  This drug was life altaring,  after my experience, I think a lot more and understand things a lot better, it made me realize the good in everything.

70	Every now and then me and some friends just roll for the hell of it. My friend warned me about the tablets being pretty strong but I thought to myself I have taken 1 and a half pills before I'm sure 2 wont matter much. Well the time I was high was really amazing felt fuckin insane in a good way lol. But the crash was HELL I was laying on my bed weak, sweating, nauseated and aching all over. I finally had to go throw up, I stood up and walked out of my room heading for the bathroom but then everything started turning black and I passed out right then and there. About 1 min later however my sister shook me awake and I went back to bed. Nothing worse happened but just learned that, I should be more careful when dosing Ecstasy =]

73	I took the 2 epills at like 2:15 and they kicked in real fast because I hadn't eaten anything but a bagel and a piece of fruit. I was with others who were rolling as well, but my high was definitely coming on harder and stronger and I couldn't deal with their fast talking. I turned some dvd on earlier that I thought may be sweet to watch rollin and tried to focus on it but it felt like my vision was darting back and forth and I needed to close my eyes and try to chill.
74	After regaining composure, sort of, I opened my eyes again held my knees close, blocked out the voices, and actually enjoyed the hilarity of what I was watching even though I was shaking and kind of freaking out as the e was coming on stronger. Then the voices of my fellow rollers starting to get to my high and I definitely felt like I had to vom, but I felt like I had control over it. I just went downstairs and vomited in the toilet down there (which is what happens basically at the beginning of whenever I roll) and felt better. When I came back upstairs I felt like they were on my level and we all chilled in the dark with the computer playing music and watching the screen. We'd drink water ritually and made sure to do everything together at the same time, and make sure we were all feeling good and were comfortable, but it really just felt like we were all freaking out and I wish it could've been more chill. When we came down from the e we took some sedatives to make it less painful, but the morale of the group then plummeted and the other people I was rollin with were miserable and it bummed me out big time. I just wanted to be alone. 
75	Once I got home I still felt ok, but after I took a nap and woke up I felt miserable. Absolutely  miserable. Nothing was good everything was bad and I felt so alone.
76	I eventually got to feeling better after I took more sedatives and smoke more weed but was still sore and the sadness still lingered.

79	We rolled on some molly a few times here in town that looked like a light brown almost tanish yellow colored shards that looked like smashed up fine glass, I prefer the parachute method in taking my molly. But the roll was amazing, definitely one of the most fun drugs ever. Impossible to not have fun, I actually rolled hard enough that when I was peaking I was kinda tripping, everything was shaking and I couldn't focus perfectly with my eyes. The body buzz was very very tingly and intense, my senses got enhanced alot, especially colors, and brightness, tracers, and touch. I wanted to constantly share with every one, a few group hugs felt right. Very fun times. Dubstep is awesome as fuck on molly!

82	Me and my friend did ecstasy on Friday. Today is Monday and I'm just crying for no reason. It is terrible... The depression is just so big I don't know what to do... I'm just crying. I swear I will never do it again and I just wish to get back to normal. 
83	I had done it before, too, like about 10 times, but never that much. I had taken 3 pills on one night the most. But this time I took 5. Very bad decision. 
84	My girlfriend told me she was also crying for no reason once she had amphetamine hang over. I didn't understand. But now I do.

87	I've done Ecstasy 3 times now, on my third time I took two pills at once.  My rolls were harsh on my body, grinding my jaw on straws was all I could do to keep from breaking my teeth.  My eyes wouldn't focus, and everything felt amazing.  My blankets around me felt like a euphoric cocoon.  I layed outside in the grass for hours feeling its cold against my skin.
88	The come down is tough though.  Next day I wake up im still shaking severely and I can't focus.  My head hurts.  My spine hurts.  My stomach hurts.  It was worth it.

91	'Do you want to try some X tonight?' I replied in a low tone, my heart pounding, and my body filled with energy as Alex Braxe spilled from the speakers in my car, Yeah I do.
92	The first time I tried X I was very afraid. I had seen commercials about its effects and one particular that stayed in my mind was one of a girl who had died from it. I wasn't a so-called 'druggie' I had done the obvious kinds of drugs in high school but nothing hard like X.
93	My brother is a DJ in the rave scene in L.A. and San Bernardino. He invited me to go with him one night if I agreed to give him a ride to the party. I agreed and brought along a childhood friend to come with me. Her name is Sebra and I brought her because I knew that if I were going to drop on X she would do it with me too.
94	When we got there, around 10pm, I saw groups of friends dressed in colors and beads greeting each other like family. Sebra and I walked hand in hand as we went inside. The building was small and there werent many people there. There was a guy spinning and the speakers were booming with loud beats. My brother Gabriel introduced us to some friends and we were soon recognized as newbies for the night. I met Lyric a small girl with a stuffed animal backpack and back rimmed eyeglasses. She reached in her bag and pulled out a string filled with bracelets. She proceeded to find one she said she had made for me specifically. She asked for my hand and held the bracelet on her fingers. As we held hands she curled the bracelet on to my wrist. The bracelet had beautiful, purple, magenta, and green beads in circles that resembled grapes. I love it!
95	Around 12am my brother approached Sebra and I with a bottle of water and placed a tablet in our palms. I looked at Sebra and almost wanted to cry. I had not even taken it yet and I was already happy. I looked at the light blue tablet; it had a crescent engraved in it. I placed it on my tongue and gulped the water down. Sebra did the same and then we hugged each other so tight and told each other that this was going to be a good night. 
96	The music and lights glowed friends crowed my brother as he span. Sebra and I danced together like no one was watching. All this was fun oh sure except that I was certain that while Sebra was in her high I was not. It was now 2am and I had not felt anymore different than that of 2 hrs ago. I began to become disappointed and the party was becoming more and more crowded. There had been another party that same night that was crashed; the remaining partygoers were coming to the one I was at. 
97	I wanted to leave for I was becoming claustrophobic in the room.
98	We said goodbye to everyone while Sebra and I walk to the exit. 
99	Just as my foot stepped onto the Los Angeles sidewalk it hit me like a bird crashing into a window. I stopped in my spot and looked at Sebra and smiled huge. She knew and started to laugh. I hugged her tight as we walked to the car, my brother behind me catching up with us.
100	I started to talk about things and people. Gabriel told me that I was talking about everything so beautifully. I put on Stereolab and felt the music flow though my body entering my fingers and caressing my face. I kept rubbing my knees and singing the songs. I thought about my world, my family, my friends, my ex. I felt happy and safe. I never wanted to leave the state I wanted to stay in my small xA and talk with Gabriel and Sebra. We brought orange juice at 7-11 and decided where to go at 3:30am in Los Angeles. I recommended Griffith Park so we went. I knew of a back trail and in the night we walked high up the mountain to a spectacular view of the city and its neighboring hills. The lights glittered like a million candles glimmering in a dark room. The tall homes under us were so close we could see the backyards. I felt at peace up there in the high sky looking down at the city I called my home. I though about my ex-boyfriend and how it took X for me to feel the feeling of let go for him. I was so happy and although I know the next day would be another challenge it was worth it. Worth it so that I can live and be awake to witness the beauty of the world and all it has to give to me as I to her.

103	Back in 2006 I did my first dose of many of MDMA.
104	Setting, London, more precisely Camden Town, at an underground rave party in a squat under a railway bridge. The music was booming and we bought 1 gram of MDMA for 4 of us at a very descent price. I made 2 parachutes of 125mg of MDMA each, it was an off white crystal, and down went the first parachute.
105	Fast forward half an hour and I'm feeling abnormally happy, I can feel the music in my stomach, as the techno booms away. Everyone is hugging and kissing each other, so I join in, definitely feeling the love. I dance away the night, and explore the squat. I feel like a million bucks. I dropped my second 125mg of MDMA about 5 hours after the first, and its around 5 AM. I throw up 45 minutes later, but I think most of the MDMA has entered my system. We continue raving away with my friends until about 9AM when the music stops.
106	I then leave the squat say goodbye to my friends and head off to get the bus back to my small university room in canterbury. The sun shinning is astonishingly bright, and all the colors look magic, however no luck, the bus fare is 11 pounds and I only have 6 pounds, so I have to beg in the bus station for 5 pounds to get my ride home... Luckily a couple of students help me out and I can get home. I put my mp3 player on my Drum n Bass playlist and dig the music for 2 hours on the ride home.
107	I get home and put on some music very loud in my room and dance by myself waiting for my friends to wake up. But I wore myself out so much over the past 24 hours I crash on my bed and sleep like a log for 24 hours.
108	This will be the first of many experiences with MDMA/XTC

111	I used X while I was at a rave, at the time it was the best feeling I've ever felt, but, now I greatly regret it, ever since I took it, 2 weeks ago, it has made me very depressed, and has also been the cause of me worrying excessively about things, 
112	I also have found myself crying for unexplained reasons and have never felt this bad before, I just hope it will get better and that people reading this will have an effect on their decision to take ecstasy.

115	When I take blue stars it always kicks in around exactly 40 minutes. I took it at 2:20 PM and it kicked in right around 3:00 PM.
116	I felt very energetic and horny. I took a 5 minute, extremely fast and energetic power walk to my friend's house. I had a strong urge to hug her and tell her how pretty she is. I layed on her couch and experienced intense vertigo. 
117	At 4:20 PM I took my second pill before I left my house to catch the subway from Brooklyn to Nyc. At around 5:00 PM on the train the second pill kicked in. I experienced EXTREME nystagmus and trisma . I saw two of everything. I couldn't bring my self to move. 
118	Around 6:00 PM I got off the train, this time I was walking VERY slow. I was not energetic but extremely sluggish. I walk to the store in the subway and got a straw and started chewing it right away. I was walking down 31st street at an incredibly slow pace, staring straight ahead seeing doubles while listening to comfortably numb. I had traffic piling up behind me. It took me 25 minutes to walk 2 city blocks. I was chewing this straw like an animal. People were staring at me as they went around me due to my abnormally slow pace. By around 7 I was coming down. I wasn't tripping, but I wasn't sober. The next day I felt great, happy, no soreness, no nausea, no headaches.

120	My dorm mates and I took quite a few drugs during our first year in college.  This included acid, mushrooms, lots of marijuana and XTC.  
121	The latter was by far the most pleasant experience any of us had ever had.  My experience with the substance is pretty much what I see mentioned elsewhere.  However there was one difference.  All of us experienced painful backaches the next day in addition to the 'wiped-out' feeling normally experienced.  The backaches were centered in the lower portion of our backs, and lasted for approx 18 hours.  After about a year of this, we concluded that MDMA was simply too dangerous and we gave it up.  
122	I'm 38 with four young children, and I still sort of miss that drug.  I haven't taken any drugs in 15 years.

125	Went to a Rave in Wyoming. I had 2 Doublestacks of molly. It took about 30 min. For the Experience to start. Mild tripping and hallucinations then a Fast high with tripping. Comparable to mushrooms. High lasted 45 minutes. Feelings of stars colliding and earth dismantling. Then a Drive home with friends.

128	I have used for about 15 years now.  I had normal healthy food on all occasions and work out regularly and am physically fit.
129	The come-up on .5-1 gram is slow. After 1 hour I take another hit.  30 minutes later the teeth are grinding.  I stand up and know whats after all this: The come down. 
130	I had nothing happen in the first 48 hours.  I went to bed and there was a sharp ringing in my ears while lying there.  It was persistent until I finally fell asleep hours later due to exhaustion.  
131	The next morning was fine.  About 12pm vertigo kicked in for a moment, briefly I have the shakes and still am having hot flashes that cause sweating.  I then went about my day.  In the evening I took what was left of my party favorite, and felt great sipping on some ice water watching a movie.  Sexual thoughts are at an all-time high, however the male performance from such high doses are not to my liking :/  not matter what! so charming a woman is great, if I want to get giggled about later!
132	The next day all is well-  16:00 vertigo kicks in again this time a bit longer and more intense.  I feel nauseous but get up and move around - vertigo gone! There are still the hot flashes.   
133	This goes on and on for about 5 more days.  The ringing stops at night.  The vertigo persists.  Day 9 still vertigo but not as frequent.
134	Day 10!  mild case of vertigo, but all in all feeling better, more concentrated and the mind is more clear than ever.  I am ready to do it again, but I noticed that after consuming one alcoholic drink, I had a killer headache.  
135	I have now had this 5 out of 5 times. and still the vertigo!  I hope I didnt finally overdo it.  I go to the doctor in a few days.

138	Dosage was a bit higher than last attempts (previous ingestion dated 2 weeks back 0,1g ). Because I was not satisfied with length of magic during that session. The flow of trip disappointed me with less spiritual fx. It is so sad :..(( Just a rollercoaster excitement and common excuse for audacious actions.  But that was just like camouflage. In fact I didn't feel extra cute (as I used to on MDMA) thoughts were distorted, speech damaged enough. And the worst thing is that I almost don't have point to doubt if it was not MDMA indeed. I'm really concerned to recover magical abilities

141	I had been using E for 3 years exactly. It was my first hit anniversary on Halloween, and I was at a private E party. The best DJs in this part of the country were spinning in my friend's living room that night... I was dressed up as a techno cat and having a blast, when this guy shouts out in my ear... He wanted me to give him a tiger balm massage. Between my brothers I'm always the one bringing the essential tiger balm... it's kinda my job... So I said sure... I gave him a big massage and then he did the same to me... He was so hot looking... wow... I was blown away... He was the only one at the party that I had never met before, and boy was I happy I had met him.
142	It has been two years since that party and I now live with the man of my life. Each time Halloween comes by we celebrate by popping a few tablets and partying at our already organised party. I believe that without E I never would have lived such a fully emotional filled life... disregard all the nasty things that I hear about the drug, just one look at my man and everything is left behind. I love him, and I love E

145	I was at this big celebration last week and lo and behold, someone handed me a capsule and proclaimed it was derived from Sassafrass root!
146	'Sassafrass!?, cool...that's my daughters name!' so I popped the capsule a prepared for the magic....
147	After awhile I was sure that there would not be much of a consciousness shift, but I was feeling good and staying open, and enjoying the band and the people.
148	BACKGROUND: On the way to the party I was walking with a woman who I had just met. She was an Israeli woman named Aviva, and is about 15-20 years my senior (I am 28). For some reason, i was feeling very open to her and during our walk, i revealed many
149	of the details of my personal life. One of the things I mentioned, was my past experiences with polyamory, and how that lead to the end of the relationship with my X-lover...I ended the conversation with...'that's why now we're staying pretty much 'monogomous'.....
150	I went inside for a drink, and i was standing against a wall, observing the people, vibes, etc, when Aviva walks up to me....
151	'FRee, excuse me, I don't mean anything by this, and I'm not sure, but I think there is something missing from your story'
152	'Well....where does Clay fit into the picture?'
153	Bingo. She is a very observant woman...though Sophie and I claim 'monogamy', it is really because we are very cautious. Clay is a close dear friend who is helping us raise our child and is, in essence, our lover....
154	I said, 'We snuggle with Clay alot, and he sleeps with us sometimes, we have another friend like that name Cosima...she and Sophie like to kiss alot : ) '
155	Those words were so sincere, and we looked deeply into each other's eyes. After a good few seconds of connecting, I naturally dropped my gaze.....
156	'You cannot look in my eyes for more than a few seconds?'
157	'I think I can' (gazing begins again), 'it can be scary'...
158	WOW....we stayed there in each other's eyes for what seemed like an eternity!! I have always been a big fan of eye contact....but this was ridiculous....it was so intense I couldn't believe it was happening. Soon only her eyes remained and her face was changing shapes and sizes.....and then WHAMMO....
159	'You know' she said, 'When you stare into someone's eyes like this, their face will begin to change, and you will see different faces, and different people, and they are the faces of history, and they are the different faces of ourselves, and some of them are even alien creatures...'
160	I was seeing 'em all! This was incredible!! Here she was giving me the most powerful tool i have encountered for connecting with people....in alot of ways it's better than sex!! (of course there is always the eye/sex combo).
161	'Let me tell you', she said, 'I feel that this is some kind of Initiation....not of me initiating you, or you initiating me, but it IS some kind of initiaion..'
162	After a minute or so more, we finally broke contact...it had been a good half hour of gazing and I was so thrilled and rejuvenated I had to go a boogyin'!!
163	Sometimes it's clearly the set and setting and not the dose that gives you the experience : )
164	P.S. I've done this looking thing several times since then with no chemical catalyst and it works great.....also...if any of you have not read the book 'The Little Prince' try it out, Aviva recommends it. : )

167	I use a very low dose (40-50mg) a night, if I take more, I take a second dose 1 hour later than my first. This keeps me going all night, and the come down is as good as none. First of all, I recommend this to all users: Learn to take small doses. You can get just as ecstatic EVERY time you do it! My friends do as I, and it works for them to!

169	I have a million of these stories, none of which I'm too particularly proud of, but this one above all others stand out. I will never forget that night....
170	Friday night myself and three college buddies decide to go check out this new rave club called 'Velvet' that just opened in downtown Austin, TX. Now, my friend of importance here is named Joe. As the norm, we indulged in some ecstacy that night.
171	11:00 Myself, Joe and my other two friends each took our first tab as we were driving down to 'Velvet'
172	11:15 We arrive at the club and start to roll during our long wait in line.
173	12:00 We finally get in. Joe finds a women that catches his eye and wanders off to go talk to her. Me and my other friends start trying to devise ways to obtain alcohol from the bar (being we were underage). At this time we were just starting to feel the effects of the ecstacy and decide the best course of action is to walk up to people 21+, hand them our money, and ask them if they would mind buying us drinks
174	1:00 Being that everyone else was rolling as well people were more then happy to oblige to our request. Joe is nowhere to be found.
175	2:00 After about an hour of drinking and socializing with various other party goers,I pop another tab and hit the dance floor with a girl I've been talking to for a while and proceed to get my boogie on, while my two other friends hang out at the bar. Joe is still no where to be found.
176	4:00 After what seemed like an eternity of dance mania I decide to call it quits, just before taking my last hit for the night. While I might have thought I was a good dancer at the time, in all reality I was just playing hop-scotch without moving forward. Again, Joe is nowhere to be found.
177	4:30 Joe is found! He comes running up to me excitedly explaining to me how he meet a girl and had taken a total of 5 tabs over the course of the night. By this time our other two friends were ready to leave and go back home. Joe asks us to give him 30 more minutes while he takes this girl back to his truck to hook up with. We agree, since this guy never gets any ass, and we see him run off towards the bar grab a girl by the hand and out the door. Mind you it was very dark and smokey in the club.
178	5:00 We stroll up to joe's truck and are spotted. We give him a few minutes to get his clothes back on and hop in the truck. I'm riding shotgun and my two friends are in the back. I decide to turn around and introduce myself to this girl after Joe says we are going to drop her off at her place on the way home. Now the first thing I usually notice about a girl are her eyes. In this case, it was her ADAM'S APPLE!!. Completly shocked and appalled I somehow manage to utter out the words 'How you doing?' In a deep shy voice he/she reply's 'Good'
179	5:10 The ride home is silent. I look back to see my two friends edgeing away from the shemale towards the passenger side door.
180	5:20 We drop 'It' off at her place and Joe gets it's number and gives it a kiss goodbye!
181	5:21 We can't hold it any longer and burst out in laughter explaining to Joe that abomination was a dude. He quickly protests saying 'That was a girl, I checked' To which I replied 'Then you just hooked up with your first post-op tranny!'
182	5:30 Joe drops us off at my place and before driving off says 'Ok, even if that was a dude, which she was not, don't tell anyone about it!'
183	And so ends 'The Legend of Joe' The moral of the story? 'If your bi-curious and want to keep it a secret, don't take ecstacy while out with your friends'

186	I had experience the pleasures of ectasy for the first time on Nov. 16. I had bought from a friend and had them tested for quality. I had took them at 5 AM on Nov. 16th. ME and my father were flying to arizona for thanksgiving with relatives. It didnt kick in till I got to the airport which was about an hour away. I felt like running through the airport hugging everyone I saw and wanted to know them. We had gotten on the plane and I asked to sit first class cause I was 'chlrostrophobic'.
187	Right before take off I had put on some trance like music and slowly closed my eyes and when it happened I felt like I was moving up 2 god, kissing the sky and riding on the clouds. The water was clear and I saw everything below it in perfect shape, the clouds slowly moved and started to perpetuate colors. I had closed my eyes once again because the high was so intense with the alittude change and I heard my name being called from all around I tried to call back out but no words were spoken.
188	The 4 hour and something minute ride felt like 2 seconds. The time lapse, which was 3 hours behind, had me confused as to where I was and why I was there. I had deboarded and ran through the airport trying to find my ride. An hour past when I finally found my ride and I hugged the limo driver, I was happy he was alive. The mountains in arizona were beautiful, flowing colors and the skyline was amazing. Later on to watch the sun set and bask in its glory I ate another pill and let the sun set. I realized that there was more to life then I have ever before. Everything was so clear in my life. It was the happiest hours of my life.

191	I saw visuals on both nights I took them(red rocket & yellow piranha). Then I saw visuals the night after I wasn't on them.(last night) I have yet to see how long this will last. I can turn things invisible.(easier in the dark) and faces are morphing.

193	Two very close friends and I were staying in a large rented caravan/mobile home for four nights at a small campsite in the New Forest area of England.  The village we stayed in is a tiny, picturesque location complete with a nice country pub and village green, which is occupied by a few wild horses during the day.  Despite coming here twice before, we still thought of ourselves as strangers in this small, isolated, rural community.  It kind of reminded me of old Western films where three horsemen would arrive in a small outback town, causing suspicion and edginess amongst the locals.  Except our horses were bikes  we were there to go mountain biking in the surrounding forest area, you see. 
194	Now Ive set the scene, lets get down to the fun part  the night in question.  We started the evening getting slightly drunk in the caravan and smoking a few joints.  We then headed down to the village pub where we proceeded to drink some more (Jack Daniels as I remember), and make acquaintance with the local laydeez of the village.  Once closing time came we all headed to a house party just down the road from the pub and somehow managed to blag our way in.  There was talk going round of a geezer hanging around outside selling ecstasy, and my friend and I wasted no time in obtaining some of these pills.  Once we had these pills in our hands we began to get quite apprehensive.  It was to be the first time for both of us but there was no going back now so we downed them and had some cheap wine.  Roughly half an hour later, the effects were getting quite noticeable for me and I had the sudden urge to start dancing like a maniac in the middle of the living room floor of this guys house who I didnt even know.  My friend at this point was in the bathroom doing I dont know what so I went into the garden for some fresh air and a brief sit down.  
195	There were some dogs in the garden running around in an enclosed fenced area, and I was getting bored waiting for my friend still in the bathroom, so I decided to feed the dogs.  This involved me carrying armloads of canned dog food from the fridge inside out into the garden to hurl into the dog area.  And this is where it all started to get a bit surreal.
196	I remember making my way out into the front garden of the house and seeing a police car pull up outside.  This brought on a sudden, intense wave of paranoia in me and being the first person he saw, the police officer strolled up to me and started asking questions about noise levels, shouting, things like that.  I blabbered my way through this interrogation with some ease and the officer went inside.  At this point the paranoia really started to creep in.  I had a feeling that everyone was looking for me, for punishing me for every bad thing I had ever done in my life.  Although this might sound like a bad trip to you, I was actually enjoying it as I felt like a James Bond character  everybody looking to kill him, but always staying one step ahead.  The adrenalin rush was like no other I had ever experienced.
197	I was feeling overwhelmed by all the action and so I went back to our caravan alone to get some more weed to mellow me out a bit.  I did this ok but upon returning to the party I decided not to go back in but to head opposite to the village green instead, and watch the action from a safe viewpoint all by myself.  I sat under a tree in total darkness and began to roll and smoke a few joints.  After two joints I remember babbling incoherently like a fool and I must have collapsed or something.
198	I awoke and looked at my watch  it was 5am.  I headed back to the caravan where my friends were fucking around with the TV set or something and I sat down calmly.  I then burst into a full rendition of most of my favourite songs and went to bed.  The singing was especially satisfying as I was feeling like a rock star or something, and that was good.  I like singing when Im wasted anyway.
199	So thats that.  The next day I didnt feel too bad, didnt have a hangover, felt quite good actually, but a bit sick.  Im surprised I can remember so many details of this night but it was all good, like a chapter out of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

202	I'm writing this to share my expirience 'rolling' with some really close friends.
203	My first time rolling was good, I took one pill, to see what the drug felt like, and I liked it.  My second time is when I got the full spiritual and physical expirience of MDMA.
204	I'm not an avid drug user, I do nothing more then smoke pot and drink occationaly.  I have never tried ANYTHIGN else.
205	My friend D was able to get ahold of some assumed really good pills.  I was told they were old school 'White hears with pink specs'.  We used a  ez-test kit, black in 1-2 seconds, very impressive.  This indicates a high ammount of MDMA.
206	Lets rewind to the preview week.  We decided to stock up on some things to be ready for the weekend.  I suggest EVERYONE wanting to roll their first time do this, to be safe, and get the most out of your roll.  Here is the shopping list.
207	5HTP - Can be found at most vitamin stores - Replenishes a chemical in your brain called Seratonin.  This is the chemical used by MDMA to enduce the feeling Extacy gives you.  Take 2 a day for a week or so before you roll.  Then take another 4 3-5 hours before you roll, 1 WITH every roll you take, and then another 2 3 hours into your roll.  This will help you get the full MDMA expirience.  Trust me, it will be worth it
208	Magnesium - Can be found at most vitamin stores - Take 1 an hour before you roll to reduce Jaw Cleching!  This works, enough to where I didn't even notice how mild it was.
209	White Flower Oil - Can be found at most herbal stores and oriental markets - Drop a couple drops in a 100% cotton rag, and inhale it with some friends, very nice feeling.
210	A couple Vicks inhalers - Pretty much same feeling as white flower oil, although the white flower oil seems to be MUCH more intense.
211	Lots of glowsticks in different varities.  I prefered the 15 inch glowsticks my friend was able to get ahold of. Although the standard 4-6 inchers are great to learn on, although I learned on the 15's =).  The trail you will see later on in the roll are amazing.  If someone knows how to use them right, you can BLOW UP from these easily(more on this later).
212	LOTS OF WATER - YOU WILL DEHYDRATE without you even feeling it.  Drink a glass or 2 every now and then, more so if your dancing and sweating alot(I sweat a SHIT loud, we'll get to that later.)  I prefer to keep a nice zephrahills bottle in my back pocket while dancing, to have easy access.  Make sure the water is easy to get too, otherwise while rolling/dancing you will not want to stop.
213	Marijuana - If you don't smoke it, don't start, but being an avid weed smoker, it hightend my roll, and even brought it back a little when it was dying.  Plus its something to do while waiting for the roll to kick in, you usualy want to keep your mind of it.  I wouldn't want to get TOO stoned though.
214	Eat a lite meal a couple hours before you roll - You will roll more comfortably on a stomache with SOME food, not alot, just eat a small sandwich or something.  Drink some gatoraid.  YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EAT ON A ROLL, everyone I know can't eat while rolling, or a little after, so DON't ROLL on an empty stomache.
215	With all of these preperations lets get to the night we rolled...
216	I rolled with a small group of 8 people.  All really close friends, that I trust.  This is the best way.  Raves are nice, but small house raves of 5-20 close people that you know are the best, you will see why when you roll =)
217	We poped at around 10:30pm.  I started with one pill with intension on popping a second one later.  Smoked some weed while waiting, had dance techno going, and prepaired the glowsticks in a nice open space for dancing.  LOUD music is key ;)
218	Started to feel it a little at 11:00pm, these rolls were good, as even all of my friends felt it, most of them being expirienced rollers.  Started to break the glow sticks.
219	Now im a pretty big guy, as in, a little chubby, 5'11' 220lbs.  I'm more of a metalhead and love music.  I really like techno, but never appriciated it as much as I did after that night.  I never liked dancing, and never really have.
220	Around 11:30 it was hitting us pretty hard.  Just enjoying the great feeling, and having great conversation with my friends.  Everything is PERFECT, there isn't a thing in the world I would change at this moment.  I feel very energized and ready to do anything.  Just enjoying life and everything about it.
221	Midnight - We are all getting the full effects now, and I decide to take my second along with my friends.  We smoked a little more pot(doesn't take that much to hit ya while rolling, its really a nicer high too) and my friends began to rave a little as I watched and enjoyed.
222	12:30am  THE BLOW UPS BEGIN!!  If you've never heard of this, people can do things to you while rolling that will make you 'Blow Up'.  This feeling is AMAZING, and if someone who knows what they are doing makes you blow up, then the results are Life Changing.  I will get to my BIG BLOW UP later, when my second roll is starting to hit hard.
223	1am - I can feel my second roll in almost full force now.  I can't stop moving.  The feeling is amazing, I love life, and everyone with me.
224	1:30 am, My friend C stops by just to blow us up.  I'm first.  He informs me of what he is going to do in explicit detail.  He asks me to relax sitting on the couch, laid back a little bit.  He informs me that he is going to have me inhale the Vicks into my left notral, then right nostral, then he is going to blow it in my mouth/nose.  He then told me to hold in the last BIG inhale, and then placed his hands on my throat and asked me to 'Trust him'.  He told me to grab his arms as HARD as I could and lay back.  He cut off my air.  The next thing I knew all I heard was techno music.  Everything was black, I could see I was somewhere peaceful.  It began to come in clearer and clearer.  I was in a state of bliss.  I was in another place i've never been before and never wanted to leave.  My chi and I were one, my spirit was with me forever.  I was under for a good 5-10 minutes before I realized I was back in my friends appartment.  My roll was ready, and so was I.
225	2:00am - This feeling in my won't go away.  I HAVE to rave.  I cracked 2 15 inch glowsticks.   KEEP IN MIND I have never raved before.  My friends couldn't believe how well I did it.  I couldn't stop, I just wanted to dance.  All I could see was the glowsticks, and all I could hear was the music, louder and clearer then ever.
226	2:30am - I was stopped by C.  He was leaving and wanted to know If I wanted to be blown up one more time before he left.  Of course I agreed.  He told me to stand in front of the couch.  He now took a white flower oil soaked wash cloth.  I took one big inhale, he told me to hold it, he picked me up and wraped both arms around the bottom of my back, and rolled his intwined fists up my spine, cracking every bone in my back.  Away I went, into my place, almost as hard as before.  I awhile, chris was gone, and I spotted my glow sticks.
227	3:00am - I took a third one.  This was not planed, I was only going to take 2. but the third one went down.
228	3:30am - Non stop raving, and I was sure to keep alot of water in me.
229	7:00 am, roll is coming down, time to go home.
230	Brought all of my friends home.  Went home, and took more 5HTP, about 3, and tried to sleep.  Finaly got to sleep around 10:30 slept til 5am.  Woke up feeling more refreshed then ever.  It HAS to be the 5HTP because my first time I was completely useless the next day or 2.
231	Rolling is a great expirience, but should only be used SAFELY and RESPONSABLY.
232	I plan to roll in the future, but not for another month or so.  Spacing your rolls will keep you safe from any long term effects.  Just don't do it too much.  Save it for special occations and it will be more enjoyable.

235	I have been having horrific nightmares in the nights following ingestion of MDMA. I want to warn people of these night tremor side effects. They are terrifying me and my friends. 
236	The first time I had a nightmare I dreamed this: A green and brown crystaline tree grew out of my bedroom window and the branches started to grow through the window. At first it was beautiful and fascinating. It turned ugly when the tree branches wrapped themselves around my neck, choking me. I started screaming for help but I couldn't talk. My voice was paralyzed.
237	Then I woke up and the tree was still there! I only dreamed that I had woken up, so I thought the whole thing was really happening!!!!  Finally after being almost strangled to death, I did wake up and I was so disturbed by this that I was afraid to go back to sleep. 
238	I have since had another dream with similar characteristics and so have 3 of my friends. I was sleeping next to my boyfriend the next time it happened, and when I woke up from the nightmare, I looked at him and he was shaking and jerking in his sleep. I woke him up and he had also been having bad dreams. They are similar: somebody or something is trying to hurt you or kill you and you think you wake up but your're really still sleeping.
239	I felt like I was in some weird Freddy Krugger type dream thing, where you need to have somebody watch you when you sleep and when you start freaking out they need to wake you up. This happened to me and my friends, always in the nights after ingestion of MDMA.(but not during use of the drug, it's like the day after the day you take it.)

245	MDMA (3) : Rave / Dance Event (18), Poetry (43), General (1)
246	It was New Year eve and I had come home from college.  While I was gone, alot of friends got into the club scene and knew a club owner who was keeping the club open afterhours for people he knew.  After taking one at about 11:00, chewed the pill per a friends insturctions to get it going harder/faster - and it tastes like shit.  Imagine chewing asprin - just worse, and it was a hard taste to get rid of.  It took an hour to kick in, it was about midnight.  
247	It was like a sudden wave of feeling perfect.  I was sitting on these leather couches and all of a sudden I just felt completely open to everyone.  I got talkative, energetic, and suddenly interested in being touched.  I saw this girl with a little vibrating white bunny.  Completely unlike myself, I just go sit down with her and her friends, start taking to them, and talking her into massaging me and rubbing her bunny on my head and face.  Nothing could match the way I physically felt.  I was clear headed, but every sense was x10.  I could feel the bass, I was in a trance to the music, any completely touchy-feely.  I would have been completely content touching everyone and everything around me.  Normally, I am not a smooth person and have some difficulty interacting with complete strangers - that completely changed.  Suddenly, people who I didnt know, I could just feel at home with.
248	And being around friends- it was really moving.  After talking, about things that would never normally come up, I suddenly realized what true friends I had.  Things like, 'You know, I dont thing I ever told you but I...[miss you, thought of you, was worried about you, would have felt so bad if, etc].  After that night, I knew exactly who my true friends were - it was a startling discovery.  I always thought of them as friends, but never as the people who would take a bullet for me.  And it took that night for me to completely realize this.  And I was so excited and energetic after realizing this- that alone would have made my day.  But it was soo much better becuase of how I felt from the roll.
249	And I have never been a real dancer.  Cant keep beat - and I never danced in clubs out of fear of just being one of those people that you just laugh at and say, 'why is that person out there??'   Guess what, that changed too.  At one point in the night, I was dancing with my friends girlfriend in the middle of the dancefloor, dancing like it was my job.  Completely into the music, just flowing through me
250	At 4:00AM, I took a second pill.  Picked me right back up.  Around 7:30AM, I started feeling a like I was going to puke.  We left at 8:00AM and at a stop light, I opened the door, puked, and was fine.
251	I am a better person because of it.  Somehow, I just had a different outlook on things after that.  It may sound fake or stupid, but it was almost like how people who have near death experiences are changed and have a new outlook on life completely.  I felt like I knew so much more about myself after that.  Regrets : none.

253	MDMA (3) : Glowing Experiences (4), General (1), Club / Bar (25)
254	I did not really have a question, per se, but I wanted to give you some information that might be helpful.  I have had many experiences with pure MDMA.  One thing that I have noticed is that if you take 100mg doses about 2.5 h apart, and you do this three times, by the time the third one hits you you are hallucinating.  I did not think that MDMA was like this.  In fact, I have also done pure LSD and mescaline and I have never seen stuff like I do with this MDMA experience.  LSD and mescaline give color shifts and trails.  I was actually seeing things on dose 3 of MDMA.  People walking by that were not there, faces change from the person I knew into someone else.  Do you guys have an explanation for this?
255	Also I was reading your 2-C-B entry.  One person reported thick mucus build up.  Whenever I do alot of MDMA I get this thick mucus the next day, and I have trouble eating all the next day.
256	[erowid note: A minority of ecstasy users report strong visuals, from patterns to imagery to hallucinations.  These usually accompany higher dose sessions.   See also Liechti, Gamma, Vollenweider's paper which gives side-effect profiles.]

259	   I am 39 years old and have avoided drugs, save for times smoking pot and one line of coke about 15 years ago.  People assume that I so conservative that I would freak out over any drug use.  
260	   My business partner and I have been very close friends for many years. He is 29 and far more liberal than I.  Last June he began several conversations about ectasy.  Because of my responses - 'anyone would have to be nuts to fool with any of that stuff' - he dropped the subject.  Following several more attempts to introduce the subject, he finally admitted in September - 'Don't flip out' that he tried MDMA.  He also convinced me to at least try it.  I did.  Like many the first time was terrifying, 'Oh God, why did I agree to this?'  Vomitting, total lack of control.  I now realize that the discomfort was caused more by anxiety than by the drug. My partner never left my side, even when I had my head in the bowl.  He was very reassuring.  Since that time we have been partying about every two weeks.
261	    The experience has relaxed me and had a positive change on my overall attitude.  I have witnessed girls exhibiting bisexuality in clubs & at parties.  Within the past two months, my partner & I, both straight and married, have become physically closer.  Two weeks ago while our wives were aways we went 'skinny dipping' and ended up achieving erections.  There has been no oral contact, just touching.  Neither of us are awake of homosexual tendencies when not rolling.  Now there seems to be a whole new element to partying. It feels good, it's enjoyable, there's no shame even though it's not discussed when sober.  I have no sense of switching sides, we just enjoy the experience.  I'm wondering if I discovered a side of me that I didn't know existed or is it just an extension of the touchy-feely nature of MDMA.  In the past we have shared girls, but this is new.  I am a very secure person and confident of who I am.  While I wouldn't share this with associates, I thought it may be helpful if someone else has a similar experience.

264	Last Satruday night I was left to my own devices and ended up at the biggest gay dance club here in San Francisco.  I was there the weekend before with a friend and had a blast (consuming only beer).
265	As usual, the line was quite long.  I struck up a conversation with the guy in front of me who turned out to be an E dealer.  The next thing I know, I was buying a tablet from him for $20.  I had only done E one other time, about 16 months ago, but this would be my first time doing it a giant club.  I swallowed the pill around 11pm and waited...
266	45 minutes later, while out on the dance floor, the feeling of euphoria took over me and I was hearing the thumping club music on a whole new level.  I had been dancing with a group of guys who were already tweaking and I was now on their level.  We danced hard, rubbed each other and kissed.  It suddenly dawned on me that just about everyone in the club was on E!  I couldn't remember a better time dancing and every song was my favorite song for the 7 minutes it was on.
267	I took several breaks to walk around the club and rehydrate.  Just the simple act of bumping into people touching them as I walked by was incredible.  At one point while returning to the dance floor, someone grabbed my arm.  I turned around and it was a cute, buff shirtless guy and he said hi.  We started talking and my normally shy nature was nowhere to be found.  The conversation flowed so smoothly.  We went out and danced and kissed.  Kissing must be my favorite thing to do while on E.  The feel of his tongue on my lips was incredible.  I asked if he was on anything and he said he wasn't.  I was a little bummed, because I wanted to him to be on the same level as me.
268	We went upstairs to the lounge to chill and I was the most talkative I had ever been.  Unfortunately, he was getting tired and wanted to go home.  He invited me over and I had to weigh the options of staying at the club and continuing my E adventure, or going home with him which would mean I wouldn't have to drive an hour home.  I opted to go with him.  
269	Back at this place we smoked a little pot and tried to have sex.  Maintaining an erection was next to impossible, so it just wasn't working out.  After a restless night sleep, we tried to have sex, but I couldn't come to save my life.  I spent the rest of the day at home, recovering.  I love being on E...I just wish the next day wasn't so bad!!

272	I have taken ecstasy about 10 times in a number of environments and I feel a loss of magic in the drug.  I remember the first time I took this drug, I was overwhelmed with emotions I have never felt.  It was unbelievable.  But now, its nothing special.  I think it is because i learned to control my roll.  I know how to handle it now.  
273	Before, ecstasy took me over.  I couldn't control myself.  Now, after the 10 times I have rolled, I'm not overwhelmed anymore.  Its nothing special now.  Another factor is the crash.  I feel SO AWFUL after a night on ecstasy that I think I would be better off not even taking it.  As soon as the peek ends, I feel drained of all energy.  I am usually depressed for the next 3 days.  Ecstasy isn't even worth taking for me anymore.

276	I usually start about 11pm. The 1st couple of times trippin were just 1/2 hits. I dont remember any hangover of any type.I think I started having the hangover effect when I got up to 2 in one nite. And when I tripped both friday and saturday, Monday I'd be half dead. real easy to pass out, very weak,could only lie in bed all day
277	I started taking 5 htp to ease the hangover, and then to extend the rolling (peaking). Then I got this vitamen mineral mix for people who do recreational drugs, it's called neuro clear. It seems to help alot.
278	Now I'm up to 5 in one nite, the next day your still tripping, But it ain't no fun at all, because of the physical hangover. I also been getting these canker like sores on my tounge, I think it could be the 5 htp, a friend gets them too, but only since he started the 5 htp. or we were thinkin that it could be from chewing on our tounges.
279	I can't see doing it as much in the future because i'm 46 years old its so bad afterwards, and it costs so dam much.

282	It was a lazy early spring Sunday.  One of those cold and wet days where the only option is to find something to do indoors on your day off work.  After waking up early--any time before 10am is early for me--my friend and I decided we would go do some spring clothes shopping.  We had a trip to California coming up in a month but we had no spring clothes.  My friend (I'll call him Yakko) was one of those kinds of shoppers who will go into the same store 15 times but never find anything he likes, so I knew it was going to be a long day.  Feeling up to a challenge that day, we decided we would take some MDMA along with us to consume before setting out on our shopping excursion.
283	It was about a 1/2 hour drive to the mall, so we dropped the pill at about the halfway point, in hopes that the roll would set in shortly after arrival.  We were set with our bottled water and credit cards and set off towards a few clothing stores.  The onset begain shortly after taking the pill, I chewed mine, Yakko swallowed his.  In about 10 minutes I began to feel mild euphoria, and my pupils began to blow.  In the time it took to walk from the entrance to the restroom, the initial rush set in.
284	I do not recommend allowing yourself access to any form of credit card or ATM. Yakko, who, as I said, was the type of shopper that could spend 2 hours at a mall and not purchase a single item, suddenly became impulse shopper extraordinaire, buying 8 shirts, 9 pairs of shorts and countless accessories.  I, on the other hand, headed directly for Brookstone, with its countless gadgets and contraptions.  About 45 minutes had passed since consuming the dose of MDMA, and I begain having visuals, an experience that I had not endured while under the influence of MDMA previously.  Shopping at this point became, well, not only pointless, but impossible.  Yakko was unable to sign his signature on a receipt for a purchase.  After a peculiar look from the sales clerk, I had to fraudulently inform her that Yakko was epileptic, and he was having a mild hand seizure.
285	We spent the next 3 hours wandering aimlessly around the megamall, unable to drive home, or even find our way to the car.  This left me reason to suspect there were some adulterants in the MDMA.  The batch is known as Cookies and Cream.  It was a rather small pill and the appearance is white, with brown flecks and no noticable picture.   My moral of this experience--get an MDMA test kit, and never try shopping while on Ecstasy.

287	i first tried ecstasy at a friends party in May of 2000, and i had the best time of my life. When the X started kicking in, we smoked some cannabis, so the full effects of the X were cloudy. I didnt seem to notice that things were more 'beautiful' as people say, but the touch and hearing senses were greatly magnified. the total peak effects were about 3 1/2 hrs, then the come down. The next day, i didnt have the mdma hangover, but i did obssessivly want to do it again. in about a week the want for X had diminished, but i did want to do it again. 
288	I recently rolled X again at a L.A. rave, but this time i didnt smoke cannabis, and its a total different experience! Nothing was clouded, everything was 'beautiful' every person who walked by was beautiful, every light, the music, everything. The experience wasnt as long as the first one (peak effects lasting around 3 hrs, probably due to dosage, and purity), but the experience was extremely better. the problem was, i had the mdma hangover the second time around. the day after i was ok, but the second day after, was the most depressing day ever. i was crying all day, most of it was over nothing. when i did have a reason to cry, it was because i wanted to do X again. Even though the after effects are sometimes harsh (depression etc..), X is still my drug of choice.

291	It was a Friday night and a male friend of mine picked me up from my house (about 7pm). He said that we were going to go to a small fast food place to 'pick up' - which ment get E - . I had rolled about 2 weeks before that and had had a good time, so I decided to prepare my mind for a really clear X-perience. I tired to expell all negative vibes in my body by tensing up differnt parts of my body and relaxing them in about 10 seconds. I went from head down to toes while I lay in the car seat in reclined position. I felt very at ease. 
292	We got to the place and another friend (female) was there to meet us. She had high-quality marijuana and we smoked it in the parking lot in the car while waiting for the delivery (about 7:45). I felt a strong 'head-change' and was more aware of the music we were listening to. It was trance (a kind of techno) and all the different patterns were getting noticed in my mind one by one. I sat enjoying this for about 10 minutes. I got my small pill and took it with a gulp of water. I knew we would be off on our adventure, so I prepared myself with a big bottle of water, glow sticks to keep me entertained in the car, and a binky (pacifire) because I tend to get really bad lock-jaw at my peak. 
293	A girl that I had never met before, but is a good friend of my male friend who was driving came along. The people who were on E were my female friend, the girl and myself. The new girl sat in the back with me while I waited for my pill to kick in. We all decided to go to this rave where there were supposed to be really good visuals. About 15 minutes later, I started to feel very relaxed and at ease. All the problems of my past week drifted away and the muscle excersises I did previously made my muscles relax. This was at about 8:15 or so. The music in the car had a really strong bass line and the vibrations were going into my hands that were on each side of me. A kind of undescribable 'traveling' sound was coming up louder and louder in the music as if someone was falling in a tunnel. As soon as it reached the climax of that song, I started to feel really strong vibrations going up my spine and into my brain. It felt like someone was 'plucking' my brain and it was wonderful. I looked over to the girl I had just met next to me and I realized how beautiful she was. I am bi-sexual, but I had never really acted upon any feelings I had for other women. I closed my eyes and put my head down on my knees. I really enjoyed the feeling of my head against my knees as if I was menting into pure love for this girl. 
294	(about 8:45) We get to the rave and there are kids every where. I felt like some one pulled some strings in me up like a marionette and I was AWAKE. I stepped out of the car and the earth beneath my feet made me feel very 'at home' as if I was a child re-born from mother Earth's womb. My female friend and I walked ahead of everyone else (due to having so much energy). We talked about how much we loved music and I realized that I had a very strong bond with her. She made me very happy and I gave her a big hug. I felt very content with it and almost sisterly. We stepped into the rave scene and i felt like I had just walked though a time-warp. The music made me very happy to be alive. I took the girl I didn't know by the hand and we went to dance. I don't think I had ever had such a fun time dancing. I didn't care how others thought of me, nor did I care who they were, where they came from, what they wore, etc. I danced with this girl for about an hour and a half straight untill my muscles were telling me to stop. The girl and I went down strairs to the chill-out room where some really phat trance beats were playing. They had these beautiful visuals projected on the screen of peoples eyes. I then looked into the girls eyes and they made me want to dive into them because they were so deep and green. I felt strongly connected to her so I took her hand and put it to my heart for her to know that I am alive. We talked for about half an hour (it's about 10 pm now) about the most amazing things. I felt my mind swell with knowledge about her. She told me that she felt close to me and so we kissed for a few minutes. It felt like something foreign had intruded into me. But at the same time, it felt good, so I stayed. 
295	All 4 of us danced all night and had a lot of fun drawing with markers all over us and sniffing vicks. The markers where like answers to my questions in life. As if everything is too serious, and I need to return to my childhood. I felt at home with this girl in my childish state of mind. Everything was simpler to think about and I felt like I floated away to a cloud. I had found my miracle.

297	My parents were taking me on a vacation to go see my grandparents in South Carolina, for a week, so I decided I wanted to do something the night before, kind of a going away thing with some friends. Well two friends and I asked a friend of my parents to take us to a concert at a club in RI (the show was all ages so my friends and I who are 14 and 15 got in no problem). I was already in a good mood, getting away from school for a week, and just had a lot of energy and a free feeling. I hadn't done E in about a month, so I was looking forward to it. 
298	I dropped the E (a small pink pill shaped like a stopsign) at around 6:45, when I stood up to get out of the car at 7:20, I had the floating happy feeling and I couldn't stop smiling. We were seeing Powerman 5000, so it was heavy, high energy music, and everyone was crowded in the mosh pit. By 8, the music had started and I was rolling hard, with all the bodies around me, it felt wonderful! I started playing with people's hair and jewelery, and had my pacifier there to suck on, though the beaded sting it was on got broken. everyone was smiling at me, I could see right into everyones head, it was as if I was best friends with everyone in there. 
299	I asked a guy to put me up to crowd surf, and let me say this, it was the greatest feeling of my whole life. Hands feeling me everywhere, holding me up, and just being thrown around gently everywhere. The only negative was that by the time the headlining band came on around 10, I was well over the peak of the trip and coming down, which made the rest of the show not that great. Next time I know I'll bring at least two pills, but I highly recomend the punk/rock concert atmosphere, as crowd surfing is AMAZING on E.

301	Here is a funny thing that happened to me on December 3, 1999:
302	I had purchased one tablet of ecstasy a couple of hours before I was supposed to go to my sorority's semi-formal. It was a rather small tablet, with faint spots, and no imprint to give me a clue to its possible name. (Its effects, I would later find out, were almost identical to another ecstasy pill I had taken a few months earlier named 'Kangaroo'.) I dropped just about 15 minutes before arriving at the dance's location in SOBE (at about 10:00 p.m.), and by the time we arrived, it had already begun to kick in a little. I waited a while and then, with the help of a cig, the roll kicked in full force.
303	It was fucking awesome. The feeling that spread throughout my body (and particularly in private areas) is impossible to describe, except for the fact that five minutes later, my friend and I had to leave because I thought I would no longer be able to contain my 'YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' of pure pleasure. What did suck was that I froze my ass off the whole time. We had taken a chartered bus to the dance, and the driver wouldn't leave because we were the only two people on the bus (even though the buses were supposed to make round trips all nite). We sat in the back of the bus, and I wound up curled up in the fetal position, feeling UNBELIEVABLY INCREDIBLE. I don't remember most of the trip home (after we convinced the bus driver that no one else would be coming for a long time), but my friend said I seemed in control and was talking (probably more like chattering) the whole time. It felt simply amazing is all I can say. 
304	Well, time to get to the funny part of this story. I visited various friends during the course of my roll, and was finally headed to my final destination (home) at about 4:30 a.m. When I had left my last friend's house, I thought the roll was pretty much over, but the ensuing shutter vision and zone-outs proved me wrong. Anyways, there I was, driving down a major highway, listening to trance and zoning out heavily, when I came to my intersection. I was sitting there in the left-turn lane for what seemed like forever, and when the green arrow came on, I made my turn. But what to my wandering eyes should appear, fucking COP LIGHTS right behind my ASS! I pulled over right away and was amazed at how relaxed I felt.
305	I knew I was potentially fucked, but I felt completely in control, even though the cop got out of his car so fast I didn't have time to check if my pupils were still huge. I turned off the trance, hid my vicks and glowsticks, and rolled down my window, still surprised a t how NOT terrified I was. The copper proceeded to quickly ask me detailed questions in rapid succession, such as where I had come from, what was the address, where was I headed now, and what was that address. 'Holy shit,' I thought, 'he thinks I'm drunk.'  This raised my spirits a little, as I was glancing warily at the flashlight in his hand, which he was using to take a quick glance at the inside of my car. It still looked bright as fuck to me, and I knew if he decided to shine it in my face I was finished. However, since his first assumption was that I was wasted, I figured he probably wouldn't think to check my eyes. Nevertheless, I was still scared to look him in the face for fear that he would be able to tell, even though my eyes are very dark, and I had not yet gotten my (lifesaving) colored contacts. (Get them, folks--they will save your ass plenty a time. You can blame anything on your contacts--red eyes, etc.) Anyways, after we had gone through the whole 'gimme your license and registration' thing, the cop (a guy, by the way) returned to the car and told me that he had pulled me over because I had swerved from lane to lane twice.
306	He said he had about three assumptions he could make on that--I was either drunk, switching the radio station or eating or something, or just plain tired. Well, since it was now 4:45 a.m., I played on the tired role. Well, it was practically dawn, wasn't it?! Well, this is the great part: as he was flashing his light in my window, he saw the tattoo on my ankle, which sparked a conversation that lasted one whole hour!!! I laugh to this day about that. We talked about everything under the sun, and you know how great coversations are when you're rolling. Even my jaw was still tight, and there I was, chatting it up with this cop who couldn't tell I was FUCKED  UP!!!!! In the end, he gave me a warning and let me go.
307	Although the events of that night were extremely funny, all of you out there should realize I was EXTREMELY lucky. If I had gotten an asshole cop, I could have gotten busted, and I have been told that if I am arrested for any reason, I may kiss my near future career goodbye (clinical psychologist). And let me tell you, one good roll would not have been worth it. So people, when doing any drugs, do not drive yourselves! If you are in the backseat of someone's car and they get pulled over, at least you can play drunk and the cops probably won't care too much about you anyway (unless you're under age--then you're fucked). Happy rolling! Peace Out

309	I've done E several times, and have experienced several diffrent effects ranging from the 'post coidal bliss' feeling to 'I can take over the world' feeling. My most joyus time however was second roll. and my only time rolling with friends. My buds and I slowly toked a beautifully colored glass bong at the home of a freind. Various people were crowded around the bar in the basement. The bong was on fire, and we happily talked as we exchanged hits. Thats when it hit me. The pill I had taken an hour earlier finally began to kick in. 
310	A note to consider, I am not the most talkative member of my group of friends, meaning I'm not the class clown or the joker member of the group which is always conversing and socialzing. I mostly just like to chill and enjoy their company. However, as the effects of the pill became apparent, I enetered a whole new world with these people I'd never experienced. Suddenly, I was the center of attention. I sat in the middle and began talking, began taking charge. Listening to every word with heart and undivided attention I quickly recived the attention of the whole household. Talking louder, I spoke with more confidence and emotion in my words and facial expressions than I had ever before all awhile being and feeling totally sincere. Everything that came out of my mouth was funny, smart, or inspirational. The awkwardness was gone. 
311	I started up funny and friendly conversations with people I barely knew, and would not have even talked to normally. I joked casually with girls I would have never had the confidence to even make eye contact with in the past I had turned from the quiet reserved Brian to the sociable, confident Brian I had always dreamed of being. I had a feeling of confidence I had never experienced. I felt like a million bucks. I took charge of the room, got the group talking, and planned a day of fun for us all, We went to the stadium and watched a game, all along, with me talking and telling it how it was. It was the most pleasurable day of my life. All the things I had worried about asking, and all the people who had intimidated me in the past were no more. Everyone was my friend. My fellow brothers and sisters. The awkwardness and fears conversing were gone. No more was I held back by low self-esteem. I was flying high, saying what was on my mind, holding nothing back. It was after a few hours of this bliss  I began to notice the drug starting to wear off. 
312	I felt a little depressed as the effects slowly diminished. I was losing the feeling of confidence and love I had felt just hours earlier. I slowly began to withdraw from the group socially, and by the end of the night I was sitting on the couch again in which I had sat earlier that day before the pill. Back to my shy, normal self. My friends could see it too. The funny fast talking leader I had been had faded. I was once again a listener, not a leader, as I chuckled at my friends jokes, trying to hide the fact that I was slowly slipping back to the drab normality. This drug is truely intense. 
313	It makes me wonder... What if we could feel this way all the time? Imagine the love, the freindship, the things we would get done. The confidence you feel with this drug is crazy. It literally makes you feel as if you had just won 10 million dollars. That warm funny feeling of happiness you get in your stomach when your getting married, going to pick up your new car, and the jittery anticipation you get when trying to sleep on Chritmas eve.. I have seen the light with this drug, and have thus posed the question: 'If it is possible to have these feelings, and feel these riviting emotions, why must we as humans rely on a pill for this. If we could feel this way, why do we feel normal, Why instead of feeling simply normal, can't we feel this great? Why do we have to experience the depression and pitfalls of our minds, if it is possible to feel this much more free. Imagine if everyone felt like they were rolling. Imagine all the worlds people with those kind of boosted feelings. Everyone happy, everyone confident, everyone loving. Imagine. It is possible, it is real. It's the mixing of chemicals in our brains. And because of this, I hope someday medical science finds a way to induce this feeling without causeing harm to the body. And when it is found, we, the people, will take this world to heights never before imagined. For you see, when your on 'E' anything is possible.

315	        I did some ecstasy on Saturday. I got it from a guy I work with.
316	It was a nice surprise! I bought a 'Full Moon,' or what was supposed to be
317	two doses. I'd gotten MDMA a few times in '89 and '90, but it wasn't that
318	strong... of course that was $8-10 and the Full Moon cost me $30. It was a
319	white powder, like the other stuff I'd had, in a clear gelcap.
320	        A major snowstorm was predicted Saturday night, so I waited until
321	it started snowing then took the whole thing, at around midnight. It hit
322	me real slowly, and in about 1 to 1 1/2 hours I peaked. I spent an hour or
323	two curled up on the floor just thinking. I couldn't keep my eyes open
324	because the natural beauty and beingness of everything was just too
325	intense. The most mundane objects took on a new light, things were
326	beautiful simply by being what they were. A totally different experience
327	from LSD, mundanely beautiful rather than cosmically and intensely
328	profound. It was very insightful in a simplistic way. I went out in the
329	snow that had built up to about 5 inches by then. The beauty of everything
330	in virgin snow with big fluffy flakes falling heavily... I can't describe
331	it. Heavenly. I finally fell asleep around 6. I awoke to a world changed
332	by snow and a self changed by ecstasy. Its left me with a sense of

335	I went to Cancun this past spring break (march 2000). I had done E plenty of times before this and had wonderful experiences.  I bought the E from these guys from chicago.  After buying it for me and a friend of mine I was warned by the person that I bought it from to only take half. Me thinking that I was a big shot ignored the advice. When I got on the bus to go to a club in Cancun I took half the pill. 
336	Within 20 minutes my entire body was tingling, I had never felt effects that quickly and I just figured that it was really good E and proceeded to take the other half. Needless to say, this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life.  After I took the other half I was bouncing off the walls with excitement.  This excitement lasted approximately 20 minutes.  
337	After this period passed I was filled with paranoia. I was sweating a lot, was unable to communicate, and was stuck in this club with nobody to bring me home.  I looked at my friend who had taken the same kind of pill from the same people and he was dancin away. I, on the other hand, was completely convinced that my life was going to end that night. I went in and out of this state of paranoia, but i would only stay out of it for about 1 minute.  Then, and this is the part that really freaked me out. A friend of mine who was sober asked me if I wanted to go back to the hotel and I said yes, but my other friend was also on E and could not be left alone. It was at this point that I yellled that I was going to kill myself (this is how strong the paranoia was), needless to say my friend grabbed me and stopped me and told me that he was takin me back to the hotel.  
338	I again said that my other friends who had taken the E with me could not be left alone, and I said that I would go into the bathroom to wash my face and maybe that would make me feel better. I went into the bathroom and tried to urinate but could not bring myself to stand still in front of the urinal. So I stopped tryin, then I went and splashed water on my face.  I then looked in the mirror and when I looked in the mirror the water was drippin off my face but I thought that it was my skin. This is when I realized that what I had taken could have been E mixed with something else. 
339	I began screaming that my skin was drippin off my face, and then i ran back out to the dance floor. Everybody was dancing away even my friend that had taken the same pill that I had. I saw one of my friends was not dancing and he saw the petrified look on my face and asked if I wanted to go back to the room. He has no idea what was happening to me cause he had been in another section of the club for the entire night.  
340	When we got back to the hotel I wanted to jump off the balcony but controlled my desire and ran back to my room and jumped into my bed. I finally felt a sense of calmness and lovingness (you know, the usual effects of E) and then I fell asleep. My friends said that when they got back to the hotel I was moaning for help in my sleep but they just check on me periodically to make sure that i was still breathing.
341	After that experience I always get paranoid and I am never able to dance. Until this weekend when I went to a club in New York City where I live (the club will remain nameless) and I took one pill and I was back to old self. I did not leave the dance floor once. I just danced and hugged and kissed everybody that I was with.  I think that my Cancun experience has finally left my mind and I can finally enjoy the feeling of complete XTC again.

344	The third time I tried XTC, I did it at my home with 4 other friends. The previous times I had done it with only my boyfriend. I planned on having a 'rolling party' while my parents were out of town. I took my pill when my boyfriend did, before my friends got there. When I was in my garage smoking a cigarette I suddenly vomited blue kool-aid all over the floor! I had never vomited from XTC before. However, this did not make the experience any less pleasent, I would say it made it even better! With vomit all over my face and clothes I looked horrible but felt wonderful. I walked up the stairs to the shower and I felt like I was walking throught Jell-O. The shower afterward was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced in my life. It felt like I was being enveloped in a warm soothing liquid blanket that made me feel safe. I returned to my friends who were now rolling in the garage. One was dancing to Lords of Acid and feeling her body all over. One was sucking on a pacifier. One was smoking weed, and one was just sitting there petting my cat.
345	I felt strangely physically attracted to my best friend of ten years. I asked her if I could suck on her nipples because I had the urge to. All of this seemed very confusing yet enlightening to me. I was sexually attracted to my best friend and I had never been before and probably never will again. My boyfriend and I were sharing with each other how much we loved each other and even considered getting married! *something that we would never have done sober* 
346	Eventually the peak of my XTC wore off and I was suddenly annoyed with having all these people in MY house.  They suddenly became annoying little flies that had to be shooed away. So I kicked them all out except for my boyfriend. After they all left, excluding my boyfriend, I felt much better and was even beginging to feel euphoric again. He and I engaged in oral, vaginal, and anal sex for about four to five hours, something never done before.
347	Then I eventually drifted into a deep sleep and did not wake up for another twelve hours. I felt groggy, irratible, cranky, and sleepy all day long.
348	Would I suggest XTC? yes. Is the 'hangover' worth the 'high'? That depends on what you have to do the day after you take it. If you have to work or go to school, then NO!!! If you can lay in bed all day, watch tv, and drink water, HELL YES!

351	I took X 10-15 times so far. each time i do it, i trip on something new except glow stix, those are always interesting to me). The first time it was all about lasers. after that i went deeper - touching, sounds (music, sounds around me, people talking,etc.), i went exploring beats and voices. I could listen to a song and separate each single sound it's made of. But last time i went raving, I had it all together. whatta feelin'. An incredible laser show, along with an awesome combination of disco lights, strobe lights, and fog. DJ playing some great beats. I had my best friends with me, massaging me, tripping me out with all kinds of lights. 
352	When I had my eyes closed i felt the music. I was the music. my friends were music. I loved music. With my eyes open, i loved my friends and even people around me i didn't even know. i loved the way everybody danced and how friendly everybody was. There were times when i would listen to music sitting down, and just go into a trance kinda feeling, and then when i snap out of it i would think just how much i love LIFE and X!! it's all about love. I felt like the whole place was one big love machine. it's ALL about love.

355	Well it all started when we (my friends and I) hit a club in Chicago; the club was great.  So we sat there for awhile and one of our friends came up to us and asked us if we were going to an after hours club in downtown.  So my friends and I decided to go and when we got up there were offered some rolls. We brought two pills each and took them before we entered the club. Well a good half an hour later I was rollin balls.  It was the greatest feeling I have ever felt.  My friends two seconds later asked if i was rollin cause he said he was rollin balls hard. It felt like everything was yours the world was made for you and that's that.  We stared at some glow sticks and tripped out on the lights for awhile and then one of our friends came up with a bottle of vaporub and put some under our eyes.  About 10 seconds had past before the roll hit three times harder. We couldn't believe it.  The roll lasted about 3-4 hours and then we went home about 10am cause the club opened at 5am. We had the greatest time of our life and we really prefer some x if someone could get some but BE CAREFULL WE CAN'T SAY THAT ENOUGH.

357	First off, whoever invented this shit--you one helluva person! My very first experience gave me the best feeling I had ever had in my life. I made sure I was prepared, so I asked friends who had done this before, and got a lot of advice. Number 1 thing---either get a whole lot of gum and/or a pacifier. You're gonna be chewing on ur gums right until you come down. Second--make sure ur around people you know, and have plenty of water. This shit makes u wanna drink a lot of water [and can also dehydrate people, so it's important to drink some water throughout the evening]. Most importantly, before you roll--do NOT eat, you will seriously get sick all over the place, and if you do get sick, you'll think its the roll and you'll never wanna do it again, when in actual fact ur missing out the best kinda drug there is! 
358	It was about 3 months ago that I rolled for the first time. I was really determined to try this drug, but never really got down to getting it. Soon enough I was overwhelmed by my curiosity and had to indulge in this thing called 'X-ing'. I was with a few friends, and they're practically all best friends, so I felt comfortable with it. Everyone around me also took the pill. It was Ash and mines first time--so we were really rolling face by the time we were 'up'. First we sat and relaxed-watching a tiny little black and white tv. I felt as if i was sitting outside of my body, that's how relaxed i was. I had my eyes focused so deeply into the tv, that everything around the tv was moving and swirling. My friend poked me as i was being so quiet, i was just so caught up in this feeling of relaxation. My friend looked at me and told me she was getting mad because she felt she had wasted her money because she wasn't feeling anything. We got up to go smoke a cigarette which sounded so good at the time. As we were walking down the stairs, i felt as if i was being carried down the stairs. My body was so light, it was crazy to think it was even me. Suddenly, Ash looked at me and just got this big smile on her face. Her roll had kicked in. 
359	We went outside and went and sat on the porch. I was so overwhelmed by the beauty of nature at this point, that i had smoked my whole cigarette already. It's amazing sitting and realizing that there's all this shit around you everyday, but you don't take notice of it all! You feel so confident when ur rolling, and trust me on this one--depending on who you are, you feel capable of doing anything--me--for instance, i was dancing in front of a group of people, not getting too hot tho, other wise, u don't feel that good. You feel so horny at one point, u can start touching others or ur self, or just something you love. Im known for hugging everyone when i roll. Im told im the cutest thing, and that of course sets me off when I'm rolling, cuz thats just another boost of esteem. The next day, I didn't feel in the least bit shitty, I felt good as hell. Honestly that shit is addicting, im getting ready to do some more next weekend. One thing, don't do it over a long period of time, other wise soon enough u'll be taking rolls and nothing will happen because ur body has not yet exported the roll. It is the best feeling. I try everything once, but this is one thing I'm going to do whenever I want to have a good time and just feel like the best thing in the world!
360	To all that haven't tried it, no pressure--but trust me, and other people who have done it, there's a first time for everything, and this first time will be the best time.
361	To all other raver's and people that roll out there---keep rolling, be careful, and most of all, I love all you guys!! :-)

364	I started raving after breaking up with a girl. I don't want to say this, but it was probably the e that got me out of my slump. When I first rolled, I saw the world in a whole new light. I just remember feeling sooo loved and euphoric. I soon forgot about my worries and sadness. That night changed me forever. I had never felt like I belonged anywhere as much as I did at the rave. This incredible techno music was tingling my bones and brain. People all around me were dancing, smiling, and hugging. It was beautiful. I became a party kid. 
365	For anyone who has raved, this is not an uncommon story. But just recently, I discovered somthing else about E. It can be more than a party tool. I dropped a gel cap of pure mdma (apox 100mg) about a month ago with my best friend from high school. This was his first party and his first time doing e. Ever since I had started partying, I felt as though I saw the world at a different level than Grant. We were drifting apart. But that night was incredible. When Grant started rolling, we became friends again. The tension between our diferences in ideology and lifestyle was gone. This roll wasn't about escape, sex, or addiction, it was about 2 people whose lives had diverged and was bridged by the surreal underground world. 
366	Ever since that time, I've viewed parties and rolling in a completly different light. Raving is about more than ditching worries and finding thrills; it's more about love. I've had so much more fun at parties now that I focus on the PEOPLE and not the drugs. E is amazing and I think everyone shoud do it some time in their lives. But I also think people should try partying sober. Be friendly and kind without any chemical aids. I admit it's not as fun, but the vibes you send will be out of the goodness of your heart and not cuz mdma made you do it.

369	So I am going to a rave and I have a big mac on me a type of MDMA or e. Well after waiting 3 hours in the line I get in. Once in I have no idea were my friends are and I cannot find anyone. So I think I will get happy by dosing so I do but I do a half just to be safe. Well I wasn't aware of the time it would take to kick in so I did the other half I thought nothing of and at the time I was alone and felt hungry I was not high yet so I said let's eat hot dog. After the dog it kicked and when it did I stood up I felt very light headed so went to go sit by a wall by myself. I had my watch on and it was it was 12:30 so I thought would sit for 5 minutes well I passed out  for 3 hours. 
370	By this time I was dehydrated and sketchin out and this was not fun. I was alone, scared and cold so I found my friends them being high to thinking that they were smart said chug water and don't stop. After that I felt more sick at the time I was walking around I was watching a big tv screen and below was a guy dancing then he fell off the stage and hit the ground and then they showed him on the screen. So I left. I went outside it was cold then thats when the hot dog came up for a visit. I got a ride home then once at home I could not sleep. When I finally left my room I felt that everyone was out to get me. Then for the next 4 days at school I still felt high and I felt there was still something wrong and now everytime I dose I only get a good peak then its over.

373	I had done Ecstasy for the first time 3 days prior to this one.  I was in Mexico on my senior trip ,and having the time of my life.  I had done E the first time at a foam party, so I thought that couldn't be beat.  Well I was wrong.
374	I had met this girl at the beginning of the week and was totally liking her.  It was my last day together with her so I wanted her to try X out.  She agreed and so I gave her a pill and told her that I would meet her later on that night.  When my friends and I got to the club we were rollin pretty hard andI really wanted to find her and see how she was.  When I finally found her she told me she was feeling pretty good, but I knew it really had not hit her yet.  We went and sat down on some couches and started to talk, about 5 min. into the conversation she told me she wasn't feeling well.  I calmed her down and told her to relax, I also reassured her that it was normal, and the drug was coming on.  She went to the bathroom and tried to throw up (I had one of my girlfriends in there with her), but she didn't and about 5min. later she came out and told me she wanted to sit down.  So I sat there kind of disappointed until this certain song came on.  It must of triggered her b/c right when it came on she looked at me with a big smile, and told me how good she was feeling now.  I was so happy about this.  I gave her a menthol cigarette (a must) and told her to dance for me.  She got up right in front of me and gave me a great, sexy dance.  Right then I started falling in love with her.  After a while we decided to go back to the hotel.  We went back and took some more (I took a h-bomb and I gave her a half of one).  We stared mesing around and eventully had sex.  Let me tell you it was the most intense sex ever.  The second pill hit me hard during this time and I was feeling numb.  Afterwards I decided to take a hot shower (let me tell you this was probably the best feeling I had ever had).  We then walked to the beach and layed in a lounge chair looking at the stars and listening to the waves crash.  I was now totally convinced I was in love.  We opened up to each other that night telling one another how we felt and how we hoped this feeling would never end.
375	Well I left a few hours lated, very sad, yet happy at the same time.  We saw each other again and it was awsome, we both still felt the same way.  However now it's all messed up.  We go to different colleges and haven't seen each other for a long time.  We still talk sometimes, but don't know what to do.  This is where E can cause confusion.  However I still wouldn't trade that night for anything!

378	The first time i rolled was at my christmas ball. It was definitely better than going to some club because all of my friends were there. I took my roll as soon as i got there and about a half hour later i just felt like talking to everybody. My date and about half my table was rolling to so whenever we sat down it was non stop talking about what was going on. I started drinknig water because everyone told me to but i didn't really want it. My advice is drink it anyway and have some gum. I was biting my face off which doesn't look good when 5 teachers are staring at you. So anyway, i must have danced to every song they played. I felt like i was completely insync with the beats and rythms. I was grinding with everyone. Even girls, but they knew i was on e so they just went along with it. I thought i'd be shaky and nervous but it was the opposite. I was completely relaxed and extremely happy. I just felt like my life was gonna get better. I was so optimistic. I knew i would do it again. And since then i've done it 4 times. But let me tell you, nothing can compare to the first time. The best part for me now is the very beginning and then about 2 hrs after. I have periods where i am extremely restless and aggravated and i just can't decide what i want to do. I feel like 'why did i even do this' and normal things irritate me. I feel like the world is just a bunch of shit and nothing is fun or worth doing. I get extremely angry when i think about going to school the next day or to work. I only want to be around people who are rolling. Don't get me wrong it's a great drug but just be careful with it.

381	i used to only do extasy with my boyfriend until i got invited to a rolling party. my best friend and i decided to go. we bought these tablets called ferrari. we both took one pill and started smoking some weed. after about an hour i started to feel the familiar rushing feeling. my stomach was turning and i felt that every time i moved i might get sick. there were candles everywhere and the heat was jacked up to 85 degrees. someone was dancing with glowsticks and there entire body dissapeared and all i could see was these incredible lights making wild patterns in the darkness. i glanced at my friend and she seemed to take on the body of a very fat person. she had double chins and filled up the entire recliner.
382	i decided that this drug was messing with my head and that i needed to concentrate on something but i was so trashed that i found it hard to do. i fell into an ehole which many people have never been in. i thought i had a ten minute conversation with this guy right next to me and when i asked him why he didnt answer me he said that i had not said anything to him at all. it felt like i had been in another body because i snapped back into reality and wondered where i had actually gone. then we took another pill.
383	i chilled and listened to music for a long time. then i looked up at my other friend and all of a sudden her face morphed into mine. it was very strange looking at my face on someone else's body and the other me started to talk even though i couldnt hear what i was saying. i kept closing my eyes and reopening them to see my friends real face but her face would not stop morphing. this was the coolest e i have had. i used to be able to morph peoples faces when i first started rolling but now its hard to even fall into an e hole because i have done it so much.
