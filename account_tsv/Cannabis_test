1	We walked back to O's house and I rolled up a few more joints. We went around to another friends house, S and smoked these in her bedroom. Eventually we said our goodbyes and see you tommorows, and I headed off home.
2	I had a strange walk ahead of me, through groves of trees, with a pinprick of light at the end. I couldnt see my feet because of the dark. I usually would have been slightly nervous when sober, but the effects of the weed were just intensifying this. I felt incrediably scared, I was sure the grim reaper was following me. I kept repeating 'its just the drug, home is only a few minutes away', and got out of the first tunnel of trees.
3	Then the rain started. Gently it covered my face in a mist, and I started down the grassy hill, and got into the second tree-tunnel. I eventually got home, and it was about midnight. I went up to bed and experienced the spinning head I last remember with alcohol. It took me a long time to get to sleep, and thoughts raced through my head.
4	Anyway, looking back on it, the laughs I had on the bench were well worth it, and the spiritual aspects I experienced in the tennis courts were quite interesting and well worth 30mins of mildly severe fear.

7	To give a little background on myself, I am 16 years old and have been smoking for over a month now. I have had many problems with my dad and ended up going into a deep depression due to me not being able to express my emotions, but little did I know this was about to change.
8	Onto the trip, it was a good Wednesday morning, my friend spent the night as we were planning on going to the movies with two of our other more experienced stoner friends. So, we figure out the time and movie that we are going to see. The movie started at 11:40 and we got there around 11:20 or 11:30 giving us time to smoke a blunt in the car. About halfway through the smoking session one of my friends points out that it is already 11:45, so we finished up the blunt rather quickly and started walking to the theater.
9	By this time I am already feeling the effects. We get the tickets and find the theater, and by this time the lights are already off so we can't see a thing.
10	We were going to sit on the top row since we were in a small theater, so while walking up the seemingly endless stairs I realize that I won't be able to see if the stairs end and I will probably hit the seats at the top and fall. So I am trying to keep my balance as I take each step. Eventually I reach the top and like I had figured I hit the seats and stumbled, but I did not fall due to me holding the rail. I slide down a couple seats giving my friends room and I just relaxed.
11	It was probably about 5 more minutes and the movie started, I was reaching my climax at this point. The movie we were seeing was a Sci-Fi movie, so I knew that it was probably going to be frightening and verry strange. I was right, the movie was very odd and I had trouble keeping up with it. During the first ten minutes of the movie all I could see was a small part of the screen that I was focusing on and the rest was blurry. This being a quite frequent effect that I get I enjoyed it, moving my focus to different spots on the screen trying to guess what was going to happen, etc.
12	Enough about the movie, By the time I got home I was still decently high. Since my parents are divorced my dad calls me every other week on Wednesday. So it gets to that time and he calls, and due to the effects of the Marijuana without hesitation I told my father how I truly felt about what he has done. 
13	Without the help of Marijuana I believe that I would have ended in deep depression before this year ended, if not worse.
14	I will deffinitely continue my use of Marijuana.

17	Its been a long time since my last dose of Bhang (dried and powdered Cannabis flowering tips ingested orally). The body grows and ages fast but the growth/decay of the soul is slower.
18	I was going through a phase of life where I felt that I was not in a very good place emotionally and it would not have been a good idea to take Cannabis at that time. Since then I have shifted home and am in a better place emotionally.
19	I haven't begun to grow Cannabis in my new place yet but  managed to get Bhang from a friend and took a pellet last week. Following is my trip report which is basically, as always, a list of some of the random thoughts and ideas that began to blitzkrieg my mind:
20	I live on the second floor of an apartment building and sat in my balcony looking out at the surrounding apartment buildings, the clothes hanging out to dry in the balconies flapping in the wind, the pigeons flying from one roof to another -all seem to come alive and were throbbing in synchrony with the music playing in my mobile.
21	Shapes can convey/invoke emotions. Figures and shapes with sharp edges are the creation of and appeal to the logical side of our minds whereas shapes with smooth curvaceous edges appeal to the emotional subconscious part of us.
22	Everything behaves according to their inert nature or Svabhava and Prakruti (Sanskrit). There is no free will. In order to exercise free will one needs to overcome ones inner embedded tendencies.
23	The human personality has three aspects - the Distracted Doer, the Tempter/Counselor and the Witness. The Distractor Doer is all the time distracted by the illusory nature of Reality or Maya. The Temptor/Counsellor guides/misguides you out of ignorance/wisdom. There is no separate Evil and Good or the Devil and Angel, two entities of voices that whisper in your ears. There is just one, like two sides of the coin who whisper to you. It is up to to the waking-discerning   Doer whether it makes this inner voice a tempter or a guide. The Witness, is just that,  a Witness. It is the unknowable super conscious part of us that only a lucky few can ever realize fully.
24	Written words too have an aura. The strength and nature of which depends on their meaning and the kind  of people who have been using them for centuries. Their energy of intention is embedded in them and when spoken out loudly with the right intention and energy they have the power to act on the material world. This is the science behind magical spells and mantras.
25	The Human mind is actually a cluster, consisting of and giving out parallel streams of thought/energy. To the normal waking mind, which is not under the influence of any psychotopic plant/drug and is therefore  slow at grasping these multiple stream of thoughts simultaneously, they seem to appear one after the other.  Under Cannabis, the mind is conscious of these simultaneous stream of thoughts and is able to look at each of them separately. But the speed at which these thoughts arise is mind boggling !! Perhaps in case of of  schizophrenics this cluster is in a reality-shattering overdrive.
26	Then there is also a parallel phenomenon  where a thought/intention arises followed by an emotion,  but to the normal mind it appears as one infused with other. We are incapable, therefore, of a pure thought or intention or feeling except under exceptional circumstances. If we were, we would be able to move mountains just with our minds !!  In Star Wars, Yoda tells his young apprentice  to 'Believe' when Luke is unable to lift X-wing out of the Dagobah swamp with his mind.
27	Most of our thoughts/intentions are infused with self-doubt/insecurity etc., all of which are different variations of the one primeval feeling of Fear. In Hindusim there is a universal blessing: Nirbhaya Bhava- be fearless.  Be fearless, of not some external mortal enemy, but your inner fears and self-doubts. Under the influence of Bhang I became actually aware of an intention to do something arising in my consciousness and then almost immediately a feeling of self-doubt or fear  piggyback riding on this intention, like a vampire, sucking out all the energy from it.  All those books teaching the power of positive thinking ask you to believe in yourself but do not teach you how to get rid of the claws of fear digging into your subconscious. This fear will be there as long as the Self identifies itself with the body, mind and ego.
28	Thoughts occur in a different plane/dimension which modern Science has yet to break into. Dreams are actually  the journeys of our conscious, sub-conscious and supra-conscious selves into their respective dimensions/planes of existence. We awake with distorted memories of these journeys. The enlightened souls come back with un-distorted memories.
29	The partaking of psychotropic substances in certain faiths -shaman, Sufism, Hinduism and others- is for the Guru to decipher/discern what state her/his disciple has reached in their spiritual journey. As change in perception induced by the drug and the consequent thoughts, emotions and visions that arise indicate the progress of the disciple.
30	The body is the product of our consciousness. The physical body arises out of our individual Consciousness and not the other way around.
31	Sound pollution is more damaging than chemical pollution as it effects our nervous system and hence our mental and emotional well being. In the long run the very nature of our consciousness will change. The polluting sounds have a suffocating effect blocking our nerves, nodes and glands. This renders us more and more insensitive/deaf to the subtle vibrations so essential for our spiritual growth.
32	In order to understand/realize certain concepts/ideas one needs to think with one's heart/emotional self rather than the logical mind. The heart too has a kind of intelligence, I would call it lateral intelligence.
33	Almost at the peak of my high, I switched on some hemi-sync music and lay down with my eyes closed. Withing a few moments I could feel a vibration in my fingers and toes, and a feeling that my body was preparing to lift off !! It was disorienting and a bit scary. And once fear entered my mind, it was over. Was I about to have an out of body experience (OBE) ? Perhaps I will try it next time around and might discover something.

35	Like any other day, my brother and I were driving to Ultimate Frisbee practice at the local park, rolling some joints and listening to Phish, when we met up with three other frisbee companions and proceeded to smoke all five joints in our van, when we finished, ready and in the proper state of mind for a serious game of frisbee, we stepped out of the billowing side door and walked from the parking lot five feet to the field. Immediately, I felt the calming effects of the tasty bud, and kept humming my favorite Phish song (bouncing around the room), when it happened. 
36	How can I accurately describe an out of body experience? It was like I was hanging from a nearby tree, watching myself walk slowly down the field. Id see myself, then see myself see myself, if that makes sense. I had a double out of body experience. I had a double out of body experience. 
37	Yet I was just walking down the sideline, it was like a movie, you know, where you could zoom in and out, make your own character, then BE the character. This whole action took about 30 seconds, but during that day I constantly felt this over and over, Ive never been that high and conscious since, but wouldnt hesitate to try again.

40	Potent BHO infused rock sugar candy.  I had a lot at the 420 rally. Its hits fast with in 20 minuets I felt it.  I wander off walking to a teahouse.  My memories from that point on happen in 20 second increments.  Like every 20 seconds I get to look through my own eyes. Dragged away from my memory I was in that moment. I could recall sobriety but it was fleeting.  Once at the bridge my movements became a bit stiff.  My ankles did not move as they should.  Gravity, it seemed had its thumb on my head and solders but this only slowed me down. No paranoid thoughts and just a bit nervous. 
41	My trek was over, I was home.  Got some food in me and I felt better but still stiff.  I then had a nap. Upon waking I continued eating small bits of candy every 1-2 hours. I was couch-locked and later at 2 am I went to sleep.
42	So basically I had 3 doses at once.  The jelly candy sample and the hard candy sample and my cookie. 
43	It affects my memory.  Memories don't record that well. This afternoon I went for a walk to ferry terminal.  As of now I only retained segmented fragments of that walk.  It was if I was home then at the park with little or no memories of the journey between the two. This trend continued over my walk.  I remember sitting at the ferry terminal then at the wooden steps of the graveyard then the last 20 feet to home. The feeling of sun on my skin was magnetic. I was intaking sunshine. About 2 Km round trip.
44	Its 6 o'clock now and the small bits of candy I had this morning are still affecting me.
45	For 20 bucks that jar of candy has over 30 doses for me at least.  That combined with my low tolerance for this stuff. Makes it a great deal.

48	All names have been changed to protect those involved.
49	A few years ago I was almost hit by a car, the driver of which turned out to be a merchant of the marijuana kind. After an exchange in numbers and an apology bud, I met up with a friend (male).  
50	We were both very into our puff at the time and liked to try different strains of the substance. I ended up with what is known as Afghan Kush. We went to the house of a friend and rolled up a smoke of the Afghan Kush to share with her and her boyfriend. 
51	Within half an hour of smoking this joint we felt a very intense fog settle on us. As I can't speak for everyone else, I  remember the high to be very thick and cloudy. Tobacco (as we all smoked) seemed to have a strange taste like a bonfire and our munchies, Haribo and pizza, tasted very very weird. I recall that the Haribo left a thick coating on my tongue that tasted amazing for a very long time. 
52	Around 3 - 4 hours after finishing the smoke, we slowly passed out watching a horror film which I would NOT recommend others try. Somehow I didn't have nightmares but watching the horror film was essentially self inflicting paranoia on myself. 
53	Strong buzz from a shared joint left me in no doubt as to the potency of this strain.
54	Very pleasant and euphoric-watch-the-world-go-by feeling.
55	Extreme munchies and dry mouth. I blame this single event for the reasons behind a filling (courtesy of the amount of Dr.Pepper I drank!). 
56	Easy to turn to a bad high if in the wrong environment.

59	It was a casual party with several friends, and we had just puffed a couple drags off of a shitty apple pipe. Some were drinking, but I was satisfied with the marijuana. As they were making noise downstairs, I was zoning out on a couch in the upper level. Eventually, I began what can only be explained as 'eating the sun'.
60	At first it seemed like nothing but a funny illusion at first, but as I thought about it later, I began to see the symbolism in it. I was thinking that it was now dark outside because I had eaten the sun as a result of innocent fun. Then it hit me: we  humans are eating away at the world around us. As we indulge in material goods to satisfy our greedy urges for what we percieve is happiness, we are destroying the true source of beauty and joy: our planet earth.
61	As it was now the night, dark and cold, I worried that it would stay this way. If we continue to harm the planet, it would be nothing but a dark and cold hell. Perhaps our destructive tendencies could even result in the sun itself ending prematurely. Everything seemed to connect, and that day I developed an even greater respect for the environment and nature than I already had. The following morning was perhaps the greatest part, for to my relief the sun had not been eaten.

65	So this is being written while I am tripping. Just want to start things off with that. 
66	I experience what are called 8b, and 8a level geometries at varying times. I see multiple dimensions and experience intense synesthesia. I have spiritual visions intensely as this is being practiced alongside Pagan Chaos Magick. 
67	I am watching fear and loathing at 10:55 PM at night and Im 15:52 into the movie. Raoul Duke is checking into the casino.
68	10:59 PM I am watching the movie. I began to come down a bit from the cannabis.
69	Reality has taken on a bright vibrant aesthetic that has a cartoonish or graphic novel feel to it.
70	That is all. I am gonna forget to finish this so thats all I have to report.

72	This trip was the best I've ever experienced on weed.  It was so intense yet, so relaxing.  It first started when I rode my bike over to my friends house still a little high.  Then we got buzzed at the house and had a cigarette or two.  Then his dealer came over and rolled us a fat joint.  We were so excited that we ran into the garage and got ready to hotbox this small ass little plymouth.  My friend took first hit then me.  9 hit's later I was laughing uncontrollably.  Then we calmed down and hit the bowl in my pipe.  I got three hits and was finally out.  By this time I was very blown and things I've never experienced before started to happen.  I started to see everything in red.  Then I looked at my friend and he look like a rubber tree with moving branches.  I thought the weed might have been laced, so I aksed him and he said no.  So we decided to go back into the house and this is where I started laughing uncontrollably again.  My friends suggested filming me and putting me on Guinness for ''most fucked up''.  But I said I'll pass  After I stopped laughing for like a half hour straight I laid down on the floor and everything just seemed like I was in total paradise.  I felt so free and so connected with myself that I just wanted to explode in joy and happiness.  I started to get hungry so I got some pizza and everyone else got Burger King.  I ate about 4 slices of pizza and then just went into a complete state of oblivion.  I listened to no one.  I was having the time of my life.  I cared about nothing.  I was like this for about 2 hours going in and out of this and other different states. I was too stoned to remember much but all I can tell you is that this was a life changing experience and may be too intense for some.  Overall I had a great time and I'm looking forward to being stoned this much again.

75	The first time I ever smoke weed I was when I was 15.  I was going to be home alone for about an hour, so I decided to take my ounce and brand new bong out for a test run.  I loaded a heavy bowl, smoked, and felt nothing.  But I was determined.  I smoked another bowl, and thought I wasn't high, but then stood up off my patio chair, and immediately plopped back down again.  The whole backyard swirled and I realized how much had smoked.  I walked back inside just as my parents pulled up the driveway, so I hid the bong and the rest of my stash in my room, and collected myself enough to go get a snack and BIG glass of cold water.  All I wanted was some water and chocolate chip cookies.
76	I threw in a movie (The Big Lebowski) and hung out for awhile.  By the time the movie ended I had eaten the entire box of cookies, and since it was about 11:00, everyone was asleep.  So I snuck back outside and smoked another bowl.  Now I felt on top of the world and very energetic.  I got my little brother (10 yrs old) to play tag with me in the house at 11:00 at night.  The next morning I woke in my bed, cookie crumbs and bottled water all over my room.  My brother said later to me that day that I was acting crazy last night.  I couldn't believe I got so high.
77	Ever since this experience, I've smoke weed atleast once a month with my friends just to hang out.  The best people to smoke with are ones who like good music, and are experinced smokers.  They'll keep you talking and ensure you have a good time. 
78	It's also good to be friends with some small-time dealers because A. I get the real hook-up and discounts, and B-they can always get me good shit and will never turn down a chance to smoke with me.  It's always fun to get a big circle together and pass around five or six pieces at once.  Everybody gets real high and someone always has something fun to say or do.

80	Cannabis (1) : General (1), First Times (2), Retrospective / Summary (11), Various (28)
81	It was on December 4th 2004 and I had decided to do some weed with a 'cousin' of mine. I hadn't done any for over a year and was really excited. He brought some really expensive KB and while we were in his car at night around 9 p.m. we decided to do it in a crappy little side-street. I took the glass pipe and took 1-1/2 hits and it tasted really strong and bad. I opened the door and threw up a little. After a few seconds I felt sick and opened the door and threw up some more. My cousin asked me if I was OK and I said that it just tasted bad and that I didn't want to do anymore.
82	Once we started to ride off the street lights started to feel like they were blinking and time would go on strangely. Every other second would skip. I didn't think I would get high but I did (it must have been some strongass bud). Then I immediately fell into this trance that I will never ever forget. I slumped over in my seat and fell into this coma-like state. I started have memories from long ago come back (early early childhood)! I started to think that life was all one big dream and everything is a pattern and that I've already lived this life and will live it again and again. I thought that maybe I had this feeling every time I got high and that I just don't remember. Whenever I had a thought another idea would come over it and make me forget. I would come up with a conclusion in my head about life, the universe and everything and why this was happening to me but another thought would come over that and tell me that it's all a dream, but then another thought would tell me that that was a dream too. This would happen for what seriously felt like millions of years. I was very frightened yet I could not do anything.
83	We drove to a theater but when I got out I was acting and walking like a very drunk person so we went back in the car. When I put my seatbelt on or tried to take it off I couldn't and it felt like I did it hundreds of times. Everything I did would repeat and it was very annoying and frightening. My cousin told me that I passed out for a while and then I threw up on myself a whole shitload. I remember parking at a grocery store and waiting for him to buy paper towels, it felt like hours and I kept on looking around for cops (I have been arrested twice for possession and it was the worst things that ever happened to me and ever since I've been very paranoid). Once he came back he got me out of the car and cleaned it up and cleaned me up the best he could. I remember looking at him as a father figure (I don't know my biological father, but I don't normally think about him). We decided to go home and sleep.
84	When I saw my dad (not biological) I tried to talk as normal as I could but he noticed I was acting weird and asked me what was wrong. I told him I felt car sick and the macaroni I ate was bad, then I rushed to the bathroom and threw up. My dad heard me throwing up but I tried to convince him I was just a little sick. Then my cousin and I went downstairs to sleep and I immediately went to sleep on the sofa with my contacts and shoes and everything on. I fell asleep immediately. In the morning I was fine, but I kept on thinking about the night before over and over in my head.
85	Ever since (it's been a few months) I think about that night every day a few times a day and wonder what the fuck had happened. It was by far the most frightening yet interesting and enlightening moment in my life. I will never forget it. I don't know why it happened, whether it was because it was KB, or because I hadn't done weed in a long time or because I was scared and slightly depressed at the time. I promised to never to drugs again but that's bullshit because for 4/20 I bought some regular weed and have done it and it was like the old days (nothing weird). I also did Morning Glory seeds last night and the same thing almost happened to me once I entered a car. I can't fully explain what all I felt and thought that night but I wish everyone could experience some time in their lives. I had a kind of epiphany, I now am pretty sure I will grow up to be a world leader (maybe The World Leader)! It reminded me of Mein Kampf and what Hitler said happened to him after he got gassed in WW1. I lover marijuana and other drugs and hope they will be around for ever and that I can keep on doing them. I don't ever want that experience of Dec. 4th to happen to me again because I felt like I was stuck in it forever and forever. I will probably write a book about some time in my life if I can do it accurately.

88	 When I was growing up I always thought I would be the one person who would never try drugs. In eigth grade I was 'straight edge' The one night my cousin Shaunna was over. She is two years older than me and has tried many difftent drugs. My neighbor Tom used to grow his own weed and told me if I ever wanted to get high then I was welcome to come over. 
89	One night Shaunna was staying the night at my house and since it was so nice out we decided to sleep in my tent on our pool deck. At around one AM she suggested we go over to Toms and get high because she hadn't had any sine she moved down here two months ago. I agreed and we made sure my parents were asleep and jumped my fence and climbed rock stairs to Tom's house. He answered the door and knowing what we were there for led us too his back room.
90	I was feeling pretty nervous as I watched him pack a bowl. Shaunna told me to calm down and that I might not even feel much of anything since this was my first time. (By the way whoever came up with that dumb theory that you don't get high your first time is crazy) I took a couple of hits and I wasn't really feeling anything. Then when Shaunna went to go take her hit she put the bowl in to her mouth and tried to light the other end. I started laughing and I could not stop. I was laughing for at least a couple of minutes. I felt so happy and relaxed like nothing in the world could hurt me. 
91	At around four we decided to get back. This was the hard part. Like I said before we had to walk up the makeshift rock stairs and jump a fence to get back to my yard. I was behind Shaunna walking down the stairs and I tripped and we both ended up falling the rest of the way. We layed at the edge of the fence just giggling to ourselves and looking at the stars. Shaunna jumped the fence first and had no problems then it was my turn. Getting to the top wasn't bad but getting back down turned out to be a lot harder than it should have been. I ended up sitting at the top of the fence for about five minutes just laughing because it fasinated me that I could not get down.
92	When we finnaly got back to our tent we ate some chips and drank some Mountain Dew but everything tasted like chicken to me. (I have never had that feeling again) After our snack we just layed and after about fifteen minutes of talking about nothing we fell asleep.
93	Ever since then I have been an avid pot smoker. I am lucky I had a good first experiance with pot because I know a lot of people who didn't.

96	I've been a regular pot smoker for several years now and have always enjoyed its benefits both therapeutic and entertaining but just a few days ago I had one of the most unpleasant highs I've ever had in my life. One day out of curiosity I ingested about a half eighth of dried buds and to my surprise I didn't feel anything for the first hour. After the hour passed by I started having a pounding headache and every visual/sound I could see/hear irritated me a lot. Several minutes later I ran to the bathroom and started throwing up uncontrollably and then this paralized feeling overtook me. I could feel my buddy vibrating and getting heavier so I just laid down next to the toilet bowl with an agonizing headache without being able to move. A few minutes later I heared some noises and decided to try and sleep over my pain, so I headed to my room and just laid down on my bed with the lights off. The headache dissapeared and a few minutes later I fell asleep. The next morning I could feel a slight buzz and promised myself never to ingest so much cannabis again. Laying down and shut the lights off seemed to alleviate my pain to a certain degree.

98	Cannabis (1) : Unknown Context (20), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
99	Im now nervously flipped out in my bed wondering what has happend am I real?? Is anything real?? Is the music that is currently flooding into my de-activated flood gates real?? All this comming at once the thought of my burning stomach thinking that food poisoning be the only explaination in my simple confused paranoid mind.
100	Next im able to think but not able to control my body, where is my body taking me to, why can I only think and not feel or control my movement, (blank)(10mins which seems 200yr's later). My body stumbles to flip the switch of negative light. (thought returning to normal)
101	Oh jeez my stomach  (blank) ok theres the toilet goddammit I cant puke Im gonna die(blank)Now I have returned unknowingly to my domain where the box of flickering light is stored (strobe light) and the blanket of light containment is all set for visual abstraction.
102	Next I put my black blanket over my whole body not letting any light out. Then I combine the light emitter (strobe at full speed) with the blanket of light containment to bounce the light off the non stable fabric that is now a psychadelic tunnel of illusionary destruction in the form of purple red white and blue and some black and mostly grey. Sooner my mind drifts I close my eyes remove my glasses and stretch my eyelids with my eyelid muscles to make it so the skin blocking this visual box of madness thinner to make a snowy tv effect which soon turned of images of hell spawns with greenish grey wings and red eyes with various very detailed weapons and the whole time this is happening Im introduced to satanic sounds and sights which I dont go to church but yet still believe in heaven because its pretty stereotypical so to sum it up the mad flashing strobe is pulsing my mind and making fire shapes and weird illusions that where mostly dream like and un describable.
103	Next I came out of the blanket turned off my Kid-A cd and return to reality with me myself and my LAVA LAMP omfg the swirls of liquady green encrypt my mind with confusion so instinct pulls the plug out. Last for some reason I turned back on the flashing box from hell and have this very real clear image of my brain in front of me and this cold liquad metal being pushed through the top of it like forced through a small playdough cutter and filling up my black and white brain all while this is happening a very real feeling of what im seeing then(Blank). Morning.
104	P.S. what I learned from this experience was that this high is very hard to make happen again without very good funding and that marijuana is more than what people think.

107	Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] 
108	One day me and my friend C were going to smoke some weed like we did every so often. I had bought a dime the day before.
109	Smoking it came with an unusual set of effects. Shortly after we had smoked it we were both seeing little slivers or crystals in our vision. It looked like everything we saw was broken down into little slivers. Also our hearing was incredibly strong.
110	We think it might have been laced, but it is probably just really strong stuff. I know from experience that there are all different kinds of weed, but this was something else.

113	I am a college student who smokes marijuana every day. And I don't mean I have a bowl every night, I mean I smoke a lot of chronic often. My tolerance is without question extremely high. That said, last night I took a hit of hash through a hash piece. It was a good 7 second hit of incredible hash. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I had to immediately sit down I was so wrecked.
114	Then it got interesting. First, I was able to hear every conversation in a room. Its like my selected hearing didn't exist. I felt like I was getting sensory overload, similar to tripping.
115	Twice during a 3 hour period I felt like I was in a different place. The first time I imagined hard a future event, but it felt so real. The next time I had an incredibly real flashback to events from a few years ago. All this time I was still able to converse with friends in the room. 
116	Once it finally died down I realized without a doubt this was one of the craziest highs of my life. It was like one of the first times smoking again.

119	It was the 4th of July and I went to my good friend, Robert's house for the night.  When I got there he was packin' a bowl.  I had smoked weed before, but I NEVER thought weed could do this to me.  I smoked that bowl with him and I felt a 'normal' high (reality seen as a picture show, etc.) within a very short amount of time.
120	We watched the infamous, stoner's favorite movie, 'Half Baked.'  Our friend Kris came over after that and we smoked another bowl.  Then I put one together and we smoked it (I make a TIGHT bowl!).  Afterwards, we WALKED to Kris's house and I felt like I was floating, like my feet weren't touching the ground.  I didn't talk much either..I don't think I talked at all really.  But we got to Kris's house and went to the basement where the band equipment is set up and all.
121	Robert started playing guitar and it echoed in my head as I sat on the l33t0 couch watching Kris messing with the sound.  We decided to go upstairs, stairs, not a good idea, they don't look real.  When we got up there they supplied me with my own water bong to toke up on, plus Robert brought his bowl and Kris had Robert's water b-iz-ong too.  I smoked mine, and helped them smoke their's.
122	You know when you over-focus your eyes and everything gets blurry?  Well that's what happend, but it was constantly.  I just sat there and watched TV.  I didn't blink.  That's not even the beginning of the story though.  I got home at around 12midnight (my mom picked me up).  The next morning I had to get up at 6:30 to go to Hershey Park with my friend, Jamie.  Even though the high was pretty much gone, I still didn't feel 'myself'.
123	Everything that happened felt like a dream 5 minutes (or so it seemed) later.  We rode ALL of the rollercoasters and none of them scared me.  I was just like, 'Let's go for it.' Because I had no remembrance of it afterwards.  I saw a picture of me on one of the coasters and I was all 'zoned out' like I was just sitting at home like a lazy ass as usual.  I'm kind of upset that I got to miss the reality of the Amusement Park being that I don't get to go to them often.  But the feeling was great!  I had to literally hold on to Jamie because I wasn't aware of where I was, what I was doing, or where I was going.  The munchies hit me later though and I had to pay $20 in Hershey for a pizza!
124	This really didn't wear off until later that night when I was getting ready to go to sleep.  I must say it was great, but I wouldn't choose weed as a 'choice drug'. I like to know how reality works, I want to be able to dig deep into everything when I'm on a drug.  That's why I now choose to do Amphetamines as opposed to forgetting things and acting dumb.  But that's another story.  Everything is Eventual.
125	P.S.  My mom never knew that I was high, but the other night when one of my other friends stayed the night.  She thought we were high as hell and it took a lot of convincing for her to believe that we weren't.

128	The set and setting was saturday night, alone, off my meds (Risperidone, escitalopram and divalproex) and I was playing video games. Someone online told me they were tripping on DXM and I wanted to level up so I took one big rip. 
129	I set my pipe down and the effect started with a build up of euphoria that couldn't get stronger when my brother walked in my trailer and startled me and I told him I'm really high and all I was experiencing was ETERNALNESS and he laughed. He wanted too borrow my pipe and we couldn't find it so were going on a trip trying too find it when I joke maybe it dissolved into the cosmic void! When he found it and we started having a talk which I barely remember, he walked out we said our yadda yadda goodbyes. 
130	I walked outside smoking a cigarette and I felt like my thoughts were a bunch of fishes in the sea of awareness who's liquid was changed to weed juice and like the mind was a totally maluable object, and that I am a lightbulb of awareness as we all are. My high settled down and I wrote this in my journal midway between a buzz and a high.

132	I had just smoked weed with a bunch of my friends earlier. I came home pretty late and thought I should try to fall asleep. I usually masturbate before going to bed to help me relax. To me, masturbating baked is just Divine. I was going through the usual things I fantasize about and I also recently saw The Dark Knight. I started fantasizing about the Joker, imagining myself as his evil sidekick/lover. I was trying really desperately to get off but it just wasn't working. I thought to myself, 'hey, I tell everyone I'm bisexual, why don't I think about some chicks?' I started imagining myself having lesbian sex with a girl who was a cross between Harley Quinn (the Jester Girl) and Catwoman. Then somehow they both morphed into me and I was literally fucking myself like two clones. Then as I orgasmed it dawned to me. The only way you can truly know if your gay is if you get off on the opposite sex, which I did for the first time. I've fooled around with girls before and I'm very open about my sexuality but this was the first time I imagined such a scenario on my own. Any girl could just kiss another and proclaim she was bisexual, but in reality that doesn't mean shit. What I had was a profound enlightening experience. It was truly amazing and one of the best sexual/spiritual experience I've ever masturbating alone.

135	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
136	The first time I smoked I didn't feel anything. I can always remember what happens when I smoke. I never lose memory. Maybe time but never memory. My boyfriend showed it to me when I was in college. I was never pressured into it, I was always offered as something polite but was never chastised for declining. After a few times I let my body start slipping into what I guess I call high space. I love being outside when I'm high, the stars seems so much brighter, better somehow. I love to get lost in them. Music changes my high, it shakes my body and makes me smile a lot. When I am high I am not paranoid, scared, nor do I freak out. I smile a ton! I laugh, I can dance, and drive. The great part about my being high is the calm I feel. I also love the body tingle I get. Small movements feel like a wave of motion, it's really quite amazing. Being high is definitely better with friends, even if they don't smoke with you. Its nice to be around people.

138	A kind patron of the arts brought my band a sheet of cookies and a sheet of brownies both made with cannabutter to eat while recording a song. I hadn't eaten anything that day, and very little the day before, so I ate half of the cookies, and half of the brownies. The two batches of baked good had been made with 1 lb of cannabutter total, and each lb of cannabutter contained 1/4lb of trim, so I effectively ate somewhere in the range of an eighth of a pound of pot within the span of a few hours. 
139	Long story very short, my world was spinning non-stop, I felt very very nauseous (a few dry heaves but no vomiting) and I was capable of sleeping absolutely anywhere (and oh boy, did I sleep). Smoked a few bowls, and I was just thrown over the edge. Band recorded the whole damn song without me, and I didn't even remember what it sounded like in the morning. 
140	On the whole, not really suggestible if productivity is in mind. It was sort of fun, albeit, incredibly intense and a day down the drain (and I do mean the whole, 24 hour day).

143	We had a gram of hash that was hard to scrape into filings for smoking.  I've always been adverse to smoking anything, so I suggested we try making hash tea.
144	We wrapped the cube in a cloth and smashed it with a hammer with one blow.  There being four of us I heated 4 cups of water in a saucepan to a boil, reduced heat to a simmer, and added the crushed cube.  Unscientifically, I simply let it simmer until an amber colour developed, which was about 30 minutes.
145	I portioned the brew into the cups and we sipped slowly as we conversed.  It tasted slightly bitter but actually it was rather good.  At first, we thought the experiment was a failure.  But, as we continued to socialize there came a point within 30-60 minutes where we realized that we were already in an altered state.  It sort of crept up on us unawares. Most pleasant.

148	One night me and a few buddies were just driving and we decided to head on over to a buddies house to smoke some.  About an hour before we went over to his house, I smoked a bowl by myself of some pretty dank stuff.  Anyways so we go over there and I've never smoked out of a bong before so I take 4 good hits and WOW I've never ever felt like that before in my life.  So we walk to the dude's car to chill in and all of a sudden my heart starts beating so fucking fast.  This freaks me out.  At this point I didn't know weed could do that so I was like what the hell was that we smoked?  Well the dude says it was laced w/ PCP.....at this point I freak out on him and start yelling and shit but he says he was just kidding.  So at this point I could barely concentrate and my throat felt like it was trying to close(??) or something like that.  Scary.  I pretty much felt like I was going to die so I got very very scared.  So they drop me off at my house and it feels like I'm in a foreign place.  I try to eat a swiss cake and I can't even get it down because my mouth is so dry.  When I went to sleep that night I thought I was going to die.  I wake up the next day for school and I'm not high but I'm really like anxious and jumpy and all this.  My body felt realyl weird like all tense for the next week or so but then it went away.  Was it laced with PCP??? I don't know.  I don't think I want to know either.  All I know is that pot is more potent than some people think.  I've had a lot of fun with pot before but that fun was because I'd get stoned and all it would do is make me chill out and enjoy food and music a lot more but this was nothing like that.

151	I have been in a family where all my brothers have smoked weed. I have always wanted to know what it felt like and it was very easy to get in a small town where there was nothing to do but smoke or get wasted. My neighbor had been a smoker for years and he had just got this bong. He asked if I wanted to do some and like any curious kid would do I gladly accepted.
152	I lit the bowl, I lifted it up, and a sudden rush of smoke came into my lungs and killing my brain. I am happy to report that it was a magnificent feeling even though I almost threw up. After I took the one single hit I was 'high'. I knew I was high because when I walked into his house everything as I have seen before was in a different perspective. We sat on the couch to watch this funny movie. Then next thing I know I was eating a bowl of Fruit Loops laughing extremely harder than usual. It was late so I went home. On the way to my house I heard a train. It was if I was standing right next to it. I also heard birds right next to me. I stood outside for a while because my parents were still awake and I was way too messed up for them to see me. Finally when my parents fell asleep I went inside when my brother walked by me and said,'your high aren't you'. I didnt lie to him. He took me into his room and showed me a 'blunt'. We both went outside to smoke it and when I went inside I had a different 'high'. I sat on my couch not laughing and acting wild but I was calm and cool. I was in love with the way this green substance made me feel. I now stand here today and can proudly say I do not regret lighting up my first bowl of weed.

155	While I was on my 10 day leave after boot camp and before combat training, I stupidly decided to smoke marijuana knowing I would receive a urinalysis at the end of it.  About 4 or 5 days into leave I shared a bowl of mid-grade cannabis between two friends and myself.  At 8.5 days (1.5 days before test!) I was intoxicated from alcohol and took 2 hits from a joint of low grade cannabis.  Needless to say I felt like a complete idiot the next day.
156	From this point on I began drinking more water than usual and I purchased a 40 dollar system-cleansing drink from a vitamin shop.  I did not exercise or do much physical activity during this time.   I consumed the drink about 7 to 9 hours before the test, and drank a moderate amount of water after this.  About 30 minutes before the test I drank a large amount of water. When I took the test my urine was almost clear.
157	I passed the test and I am grateful for it.  I think I was lucky considering the short time between smoking and the test.

160	Before starting the report, I'd like to say that I dont have a very advanced english, so sorry about that.
161	Friday night, around 9pm, I was hanging out with friends, playing gta 5 and smoking some cigarretes, pretty chill, so we decided is was a good idea to meet with a friend who had cannabis, before we left the house We drinked some vodka, I drank 1 big shot, all my friends drank the same, and we left.
162	We reached this friend house around 10:35 pm and before started smoking, we had a beer, I almost drank it all myself, then we started smoking. I smoked 2 big hits of a very low quality weed (I'm from Argentina and having dank buds its extremely expensive, normally we smoke this thing we call 'prensado'). It took around 2 minutes to hit. 
163	10 minutes after it hit I was totally baked, barely could walk, and only could only say around 3 words, I think its important to say that I dont smoke regularly and I have a really low tolerance to THC, however this never happened to me, at the moment I was feeling extremely paranoid and my thoughts were very slow. I had to stop to rest a little bit on every block, it was imposible to walk in a straight line. My friends were helping me to walk, we had to walk around 25 blocks to reach my home. 
164	All my memories after we started walking just dissapeared, I remember I asked the hour a couple times, first time I asked it was 10:50, second time it was 12:35 am. My time perception was really distorted, and I dont know exactly why it took us so long to reach my home. When we reached my home I said goodbye to my friends and entered my home, I could not fucking describe how beautifull it was to throw myself to bed, all the paranoia was gone, it was all solved, it was beautiful. I eat something and sleeped feeling like god. 
165	The morning after I was still really buzzy, and wondering why the fuck 2 hits of a low quality joint hit me that much.

168	Walking home after smoking so much weed I felt like I was a big system, I felt like I was a robot so I had to consciencely tell my legs where to go with each step feeling like a earthquake of euphoric sensations.
169	After a minute I had audial hallucinatons. Sounding like waves of a harp like noise plus some weird bass/beat all in sync.  I was walking a few miles with fattest grin of my life, (this wasn't my first time or anywhere near) I tried to grab my face and physically change the smile, my face felt like rubber, I couldn't  remove the smile I was too happy. 
170	When I arrived home I made some cereal because munchies, it tasted a lot more intense and I could feel the chewing more.  I turned a call of duty game on and was utterly destroying the other team without even thinking hard, it was like my subconscious was focusing on the game  like my life depended on it but consciously I was in space, one of my best highs in my life,

173	I was just playing rummy and listening to some music with my brothers. We smoked two good bowls, 1 from each of us. I don't smoke often so I really felt it rip me up tonight. I felt like we were floating over the rummy cards as were if we were the cards being put down also! It was hard to concentrate and keep focus. I played a few wrong moves over the games due to going to space at the moment. Then I would laugh after realizing it and my brother would be unimpressed. We both would laugh at a few things over the games. I felt like I was on clouds. I do not feel like moving. I have a light feeling and getting ready to go to bed to float to some music while I drift off. phew was baked! I still am as I write this short after this experience. I am so relaxed now. Good times.

176	Weed is really the only drug I've tried. No hard drugs or anything like that. Now I'm 15...
177	Its a school night, I finished all my homework, so why not smoke a few bowls (out of a homemade bong thing)? I did that, and just sort of read a book until I felt it. When I did feel it I was a little jittery and couldn't focus on the book. I felt like just lying down, so I turned off the lights and did that.
178	At this point I felt calm and relaxed. I put on my earphones and listened to the band 'Rush' for quite a while. The feeling is amazing. Just complete bliss, and listening to meaningful music. I was transfixed in a way... Just lying down, sometimes touching my face because it felt soft for some reason, and enjoying the music. I laugh about me singing loudly to that music now, but I immensely enjoyed it. This just continued until I fell asleep.
179	This has never happened before when I smoked.. and it hasn't happened since. But it was one of the best times smoking, and I hope I can achieve it again sometime.

181	I will make this short. One night me and my friends got a hotel room and decided to kick it. Me and my friends smoked the whole blunt and start drinking again. One of my friends curled up and went to bed almost immediately after smoking the joint, the other one kindda lay down on the bed. Approximately 5 minutes after smoking I felt this intense rush going through my head and my heart start to beat fast as hell. I could hear my heart pound like crazy. I felt like I was losing my mind and almost wanted to kill myself just to stop what was happening. I couldn't really tell if I was feeling cold or hot, so I hopped in the shower and doused myself with water just to feel cold again so I would turn the water hot , and feel hotter , so I would turn it cold again - I felt like I was in hell lol. It finally wore off after a couple hours. It was one of the scariest moments of my life, I hate to lose control of myself so I will let off the weed for a while. thanks for reading

184	I have just smoked a bowl and as I am beginning to feel the warm onset of dope pleasure I am thinking about what Marijuana has done to me. I've only been smoking for a year and-a-half, but my life has definitely changed since that first waterfall. My taste in music has become broadened, I am a calmer person. I feel more generous and loving towards my friends. I think that in general it has made me a better person. I can see the beauty in everything, from a butterfly on a flower to the view of a night city from high up. However I do feel that Anti-Motivational Syndrome is a real thing, but I have tried to be a 'responsible' user and  always tried to complete my studies. 
185	I had smoked weed on a couple of occasions before I decided to cook with pot. My friend 'K' had told that when you eat your pot you get a much different high than if you had smoked it, and I was eager to experiment. I searched the web for an easy recipe, and I found one that involved crackers and peanut butter. I chopped a fairly large nug (about 2 grams) of silver haze into fine shake, spread the crackers with peanut butter, and sandwiched the weed between them. I wrapped the 'Firecrakers' in foil, and heated them over a gas stove for a good ten minutes. After they were cooked, I popped one in my mouth and waited. After thirty minutes I felt nothing, so I ate the other sandwich.
186	About an hour after eating the first sandwich, it hit me HARD. I was watching Chappelle's show, And I noticed that I had an arm like a cat's. My watch became a stripe, my hair was fur, and my fingers were claws! I had never experienced anything like this after smoking, this was amazing. My high continued escalating to the point where I could not get up out of my bed, my legs had become part of the bed, like they melted together. about six hours after ingesting my first cracker, my parents came home,and I was still high. My mother came to say goodnight, and I was barely able to utter goodnight. I slipped into deep sleep and to my amazement, when I awoke, I was still fucking high. After sixteen amazing hours I started to come down. This was an experience to remember.

190	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
191	Well, one day in July, I was at my swim club. I meet a guy. W got to talking and he said he had some dank nugs in his car. I agreed and threw in 5 dollars to compensate the cost. We approached his car. He packed the biggest glass bowl I had ever seen. We got to smoking. I didnt feel high towards the end. As soon as I got out of the car. That was when it all kicked in. My Beautiful vision of a bright day turned into a dark night. I got on my bike, and began to ride home. The color of the sky was changing with multiple different colors. As soon as I got to my home I realized that the high was extremely unmanagable. I went to my room,  turned on the tv and layed down. I watch a episode of family guy. As soon as I turned of the tv, I turned my head and my vision faded behind me. I closed my eyes for a little while. When I opened them up, I saw clocks all over my wall, everywhere. I went to sleep and that was it.

194	So here is the story I had quit smoking marijuana for about 6 months for probation and I was very excited about being able to smoke again.  A couple of my friends and I got together because we were all going of to college or starting to work.  So my buddy picked up a cople grams of purple haze and we used my buddy's bong that had an ice catcher which we filled with ice.  So we passed the bong around once and we each took our hit and started coughing like crazy and all of of a sudden I started puking my brains out.  I couldn't stop throwing up for a good 10 minutes and then I came back and sat down.  I took another hit and I began dry heaving for about 5 minutes really bad and then my body just went limp, I felt as if I were paralyzed.  But overall all I could say to my boys is  'thats some good weed' (thats what I said when I came back from puking).

197	I skipped out on class and went with some friends to smoke some weed. We were 4 and we smoked about 6 grams in total.
198	It was all fun and we were laughing for the first hour or two. Then 2 of my friends went home and me and the other guy went to mall to get something to eat.
199	After we ate, we went out for a cigarette through the emergency fire escape door. After we finished the cigarettes, he left to go home, I started walking to take the city bus.
200	I started to feel really heavy, I couldn't even scratch my head because my arm felt so heavy. I started to sweat but at the same time I was feeling really cold, I could barely see anymore, I could only see one thing and the backround was all black. For example, I would look at a car and it would be all I see nothin else. 
201	I just sat down next to the wall and curled up into a ball and just watched people pass by for about 2 hours.
202	When I got home I just passed out on the couch.

204	Last summer I was 14 (I am 15 about to turn 16 in 2 months) I tried weed for the first time and I loved it I laughed hours on end. After this experience I smoked more often about a few times a month. February of this year I started hanging out with this girl who bought a dime to 3 20's a day we would finish all of it and be high for hours I would go to her apartment EVERY single day and smoke and I love the feeling of being high from Marijuana. It is now July 2004 and I haven't been sober since February.
205	I have to smoke at least once a day or I get depressed and get in a pissed off mood I mean I know Marijuana isn't physically addictive but I'm addicted in a psychological way. Everytime my high comes down I always say I need more wanting to keep the high going of course. I have had other experiences with other drugs such as Alcohol, Shrooms, LSD, PCP, Coke, Xanax & Vicodin and I find Marijuana to have the best effects on me.

208	I can hardly sleep. At the time of the report I was working 12 hours daily next to university studies.
209	T 00:05 -- 200mg hash in shisha continously for 30 minutes 
210	T16:58 Bit pressure in stomach, active tiredness.
211	More than an hour of sleep close state. Can't perceive any sense of time. Sometimes waking up to the fact that my breathing had turned to be manual.  This occassion is covered with some kind of dream like vision of people entering the door. Numb hands, heavy heart rate, motorical funcions on.  I can hold the bottle but only with visual feedback. After drinking some water less physical hardness. 
212	4 hours of sleep with vivid dreams about people entering the door - leaving me sedated. Consciousness takes over about 3 times, dreaming patterned thought flows while awake.  After another 4 hours of sleep, waking up dizzy sober.

215	Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] 
216	Last night I smoked some weed laced with, I didnt know at the time, PCP. This bong was crazy it costed well over 400 dollars and all I needed was one hit to send me flying around. I started to get a little confused/shocked feeling in about five minutes but the real effects didnt set in until about 15 minutes later. Normally I am a fun, giggly, talkative person when I am high but this was much different and I knew right away this wasnt just any weed. 
217	Sumblime was playing and it felt as if the room was swaying to the music and it wouldnt stop, almost like being drunk but in a weird way. I also found that during this time my throat was hurting intensely, it felt so dry but no matter what I would drink I could NOT quench it. I remember describing to my friend that my throat kept 'going up in the back all tight.' I think that I must have been clenching it or something I have no idea.
218	I spent a lot of time last night trying to sort myself out, trying to come down a little and figure out if I was acting weird and what my body was doing. But only after my friend pointed it out I realized my whole entire body was shaking and my feet felt like they were in small pools of water. (Now that I think back on it I might have been cold but I remember feeling hot.) I then convinced myself that my foot was asleep and thats why I was feeling so out of it and I kept telling my friends ' I figured it out, I figured it all out.' My body felt extremely disconnected, which made me feel a little bit stupid because I couldn't really control myself. 
219	Then about 30 minutes into it I felt drenched, I thought someone poured water on me but I wasnt sweating or anything. Then I sit up straighter and realized that everything looked so weird, I felt like we were in some sort of production like a music video. Then I got scared that everyone was judging me and thought I was the only fucked up one, I kept asking if anyone else hit the bong. I no longer felt in place, I felt outcasted and started to worry about every little move I made, I didnt want to look stupid. Then all of the sudden I just decided that I needed to cheer myself up so I said 'guys we have to think positively you shouldnt care what people think about you' apparently it was a really random statement because everybody got a real laugh but it really helped my trip get better.
220	After I started to settle myself down all I could think about was birthday cake, I had a bad craving to go to the grocery store and just explore but I had to go home. When I got up I felt a huge head rush because I hadn't gotten up that whole time and I felt extremely uncoordinated like I was drunk. 
221	Overall it was a pretty interesting experience that lasted intensely for about 5 hours but I still feel some effects today and last night I didnt sleep at all, or maybe I did. It was weird I couldnt tell if I was sleeping or awake and it didnt help that I went home alone. 
222	Today, I feel a little strange almost like I'm just at the very very end of a normal high. Groggy, incoordinated and a little awkward. And I can honestly say that I do not know how I got home but that my friend drove.

225	One beautiful Thursday night me and my friend...let's call him Jeff...we decided to go for a smoke. So we walked to the local park and when we arrived another 3 of our buds (malcom, des and ryan) showed up out of nowhere. So I asked them 'Are you guys here for the same reason we are?' They nodded. 
226	Malcom pulled out 2 joints each with .5g in them.  We lit them up and passed them around. It was very unusual. It didn't feel strong at first but it had an afterburn. About a minute after I toked I started coughing like crazy. 
227	After finishing both joints we decided to leave the area and continue to a new one. Malcom said we had to find the silver left from captain gold. At this point all 5 of us were completely stoned. This was REALLY good weed. We wanted to hit up my bong but we had no water. I then saw a little puddle of water left from the rain of the previous night. All of us were too stoned to care. So I filled it up and we hit a couple bowls. 
228	We continued walking down the path...I really forget where we went from there...oh ya...we continued down the path and I found a broken tv under a tree. I was very excited at the sight of this. I ran up and tried to rip a piece of the glass out, resulting in me cutting my hands up. 
229	We then found ourselves at a quickie but we only had $1. So we just bought 3 airheads. I forget where we went from there but we somehow ended up at malcom's house and Jeff had vanished. when we got there...we ate.
230	They listened to some music and I sat and thought. The 1st dimension is side to side the 2nd is up and down and the 3rd is forward and back. The fourth dimension is time, which for the moment we'll say time is a line of time, we can go forward in time and perhaps back in time. So the fifth dimension would be side to side on this plane of 'time' and the 6th would be up and down. The thought of this made me feel as if I had just figured something amazing out. Then I thought to myself that this must be the answer to time travel. The rest of the night was spent eating bread, white chocolate chips, mustard and hot sauce. As me Ryan and des walked home, we ran into malcom's older brother in his van. He offered us some sniffing tobacco. We all tried it. It felt kinda minty. I don't remember what happened after that but I remember listening to stairway to heaven by led zeppelin and I could hear the wood of the drum sticks hitting the drums. The next thing I remember I was in english class the next morning. But that must have been the best weed I've ever had. I'm planning to get some more.

232	Some time ago I embarked with fellow students from my University to Amsterdam to sample the local culture. I ended up speaking to another student from Manchester, who introduced me to Super-Skunk at one of the venues in the city. After taking our seats and acquiring a certain amount of the substance, rolled nicely into a 'doobie', I proceeded to smoke the joint. 
233	After a few tokes, I began to feel very odd indeed and very quickly it appeared as if time was going backwards. After that I stumbled back to the hostel, where I was staying, and began to panic. The chemical wore-off after a couple of hours and, thankfully, there was someone there who helped to allay my fears. All-in-all, an awful experience that in retrospect I was very unprepared for. That said, I am still inspired by Aldous Huxleys The Doors of Perception and look forward to experimenting further in the future. The more we understand the effects of all dopes, the better they can be applied in future.

236	I had been smoking every night for about 6 months, and had started smoking about 8 months before this night. I had had a couple 'bad' highs, the first time I really felt the effects, I flipped out to some degree, but it hadn't happened in quite a long time. 
237	I had about 3/4 a gram of some herb that I used to pack a bowl with, I got into my normal position, which is just sitting on my floor next to my open window, so I could blow the smoke out of my window, cause the whole thing was very under the radar, not wanting to get caught. Anyways I smoked most the bowl, and realized I could barely even hold the bowl anymore, and that the last 2 or 3 hits I wasn't even aligning the lighter and bowl correctly. I took this as a sign that I probably had smoked enough for the night. 
238	I must have went through my normal routine of covering everything up and hiding my bowl, but I don't really recall any of it. After this I, to great disappointment, realized that I didn't have my CD player in my room, and was gonna hafta enjoy this high music free. I was getting into bed, and thought I saw lights coming on in the hallway outside my room, which freaked me out, but I tried to remain calm, and go on with going to sleep. I turned out my light got into bed, fully clothed and with a beanie hat on, for some reason, and just sat there. I started to enjoy the music I was listening too, and then realized, there was no music playing, but in my head it was just as real as if I had my CD player on. 
239	at first I enjoyed it, but for some reason, it suddenly freaked me out, then the beanie I had on felt like just billions of needles all poking into my head, I ripped it off, but immidiatly felt the same sensation all over my body, and took off everything but my boxers. During this my heart had started beating very rapidly, and I began thinking unfavorably of death, and it didn't seem altogether out of the question. 
240	The music at some point had then turned into voices and noises. I could hear my whole family outside my door, all knowing I was high as a kite, and then I could hear my door knob rattling and shaking, and knew they were all trying to get in my room, I realized I was shaking uncontrollably, and instantly thought that the best way to avoid getting caught was to play that I was asleep. I became very still, and just waited for the door to open, and my family to burst into my room, but it never came. 
241	I realized none of it was real, and then went through two more similar experiences like the one that had just happened. I finally calmed down, and fell asleep. The odd thing was the next day, I looked back on the experience somewhat favorably, at the time I was terrified, but looking back, I enjoyed it to a degree.

244	Time: A little after sunset, still light out Location: Lawnchair in my backyard
245	So I'm in my backyard, just got home from a good day of blazing and walking around the forest. Decide to grind up a sesh before going inside. Drop two fat bowls out of my bong. Feeling right stoned so I lay my head back on the lawnchair and close my eyes. I instantly notice orange at the bottom of my closed eye vision, which shifts into a large circle, I now realize I am standing on a large orange sphere and can look around, looking up I see more orange spheres which reminded me of planets at the time and decide to jump to one of them, I then continued to jump between planets until I opened my eyes and went inside.

247	I have been smoking marijuana for about 18 months now, so I'd say I have reasonable experience with it. But something really weird happened a few months ago. Me and some friends were hanging out, and we decided to buy some weed. We bought a gram each of this new crazy hydro stuff that was in town at the time. We sat down, and I I whizzed it up, I felt excited that this would be a new experience. How right I was. We passed the bong around, and afterward I realized I should have only had 1 cone and waited, but had 3 in succession. It kicked in hard. I felt my face go cold, I was laughing hysterically, almost passing out. But did I stop there? NO. I smoked the rest of my gram.
248	I could not feel below my neck. I was kinda scared that I was paralyzed. Then I started rubbing my head against the couch and it was burning so I thought my hair was on fire.
249	All in all it was a crazy night. Still fun but crazy.

251	Cannabis (1) : Overdose (29), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
252	I am an autistic (Aspergers Syndrome) somewhat depressive young lad, or at least I was back in the sober days. My mind seemed like it was on it's own world, of course heavy autism and abusive parenting'll do that to me. I hadn't gotten very many friends, of course the ones I did have I was loyal to, and had known for upwards of 10 years. I was very argumentative and almost insane by most standards, though I had always been incredibly smart.
253	My family didn't seem to mind that I was interested in drugs of all kinds since early childhood. By age 13, my mother dealt LSD in her school girls bathroom and was an intense druggie since age 11. My father was an alcoholic, my step father had tried every drug that I know of, from Cocaine to Crack to Heroin to LSD, he'd been addicted to it at some point in time. My brother's fate was much the same, so it comes as no shock that an interest wouldn't scare them at all.
254	My first dose was on my 13th birthday at 3AM. I was the only one who wasn't drunk, but every time I had gotten drunk at that point I made an ass out of myself, so I wanted to steer clear of alcohol that night. Some of my older brother's friends had the idea to split a joint with me, and I heartily accepted. After 3 hits I was extremely baked. I later found out that my mother was a stoner while pregnant with me as well, so THC had already been introduced into my system years beforehand. I spent the time playing a Prince of Persia game I had received that year, when my ex-druggie brother walked in and asked me how I was feeling. What I was thinking was, 'Pretty good, but my mouth's a bit dry.' whereas what I said was, 'Get the penis outta your bum and start being Jeffrey Dahmer.' I was legendarily baked, and that was clear to my older brother at that point in time.
255	Skip forward to the end of that month where I try to get some weed from an Ecstasy dealer my brother used to go to. I got ripped off obviously, but I later found out that he had actually been chased out of the building by someone he had hit over the head with a wrench earlier that day, and also that some of my brother's friends had beaten him up for ripping me off, and so to repay me at lunch on a monday when I was walking back to school, he handed me a baggie with 0.5 grams of bad hash oil in it. This promptly caused the most awkward school day of my life, because I was in grade 8 and trying to figure out where to hide very potent smelling drugs. I put it in my pocket for the rest of the day, and although every single teacher knew exactly what I was doing and what was in my pocket (the smell of bad marijuana filled the room) but I was so far in every teacher's good books by default for reasons unknown (teachers always have and always will adore me for absolutely no reason) that they never said anything and let me go home at the end of the day without so much as a disapproving glance. My brother promptly taught me how to smoke oil, how to make  a pipe from a water bottle and how to make a bong from a water bottle.
256	Skip forward a week when my weed supply runs out. My brother decided to get me a 1.5 piece as well as hook me up with an amazing dealer, and another less amazing dealer that just so happens to be the drug kingpin of my town. I was planning on requesting instructions on how to roll a joint, but when I tried I succeeded.  Everyone in my family jokes that I inherited the ability to roll a joint from my mother, but I will never be able to roll the perfect joint like my mother can. (They have less imperfections than fucking factory made cigarettes!) From this point on things get royally fucked up!
257	I had started using weed as a coping method for school, and holy shit did I do a lot of it at school! I went to school baked every day for multiple years without exception, and I keep that record even today. At this point, I noticed a few things changed in my life significantly. Puberty is the only thing that compares to how many changes I went through at this stage of my life, only puberty was far more mild and these changes occurred literally overnight. I suddenly realized that I liked music, something that I absolutely hated earlier on in life, and I also noticed that I began to form genuine opinions of things rather than my mind being comprised of mathematics and fucked up algorithms without any real feelings towards anything. I had noticed that I felt genuine emotions and I learned to appreciate the little things in life. Instead of being constantly depressed, I was amused with my life and I was genuinely happy. I had never experienced true happiness before this point. It was truly a miracle.
258	The best trip in my life (no, I've never had a bad trip) happened when my brother's best friend came into town. It was a total shock to him that I had become a total stoner since the last time I had seen him, so as a token of good will (and because he had no way of smuggling that stuff to his new home) he gave me a mini pipe with a built in stash and resin holder (it's an inch long and 4 centimeters thick) and a pipe from Israel. It is by far the most awesome pipe I've ever seen, to this day. To celebrate these new items of mine, we decided to try them out. I smoked a full gram that day. We then went to my room after getting legendarily baked and we went into my room to play Halo. We played it muted, and we listened to every song The Beatles ever wrote. If you think orgasms feel good, you've seen absolutely nothing. Years of pain and depression all seemed to be forgiven when I realized that the world was fucking awesome and not only did all my troubles fade away, but every emotional scar I had received over the course of my life was removed, of course my mind showcased that moment to me during the best riff known to man. (When I'm 64 by the Beatles, the part where Paul goes, 'You'll be older too' is by far the most amazing thing that has ever been recorded in the history of music.) That 3 hour period will forever be known as the best moment in my life never to be topped and forever to be held up high as the meaning of existence and the sole reason life's worth living to the very last second.
259	Weed does have some amusing negative repercussions though, and here are a few of the more embarrassing things that weed has caused. I don't regret them in any way, and looking back on them, I see them as terribly amusing and well worth the price of admission.
260	The first one is one that continues to this day, but basically I would make an account on any website I could find, then go to a random part of the website and proceed to complain about everything being in English (in French) and how they should re-write everything in French. I've been banned so many times, it almost gets hilarious by itself. 
261	 The second time is one day, I had the brilliant idea of smoking 4 joints before going to school. I had been smoking for under a month, (2 weeks to be exact) and I was buying A grade weed. This stuff gets me fucked to this day and it was amazing that I was using that for practice. I went to school and fell asleep leaning against my locker only to be awaken by the Special Ed teacher tapping on my head and telling me I still had 10 minutes left until class. She knew I was on-top-of-the-moon stoned at that point because it was blatantly obvious. The only people who didn't notice were the kids who thought I was just some weird kid, so me being baked just registered to them as me being weird. (Grade 8) I went to my first class which happened to be double science, and I promptly started tripping balls, including a point where I completely forgot what my name was and so I decided I was Patrick Swasy for 10 minutes. The next class was math. We had a test that day, and being fucked beyond any inkling of a doubt kinda impairs my ability to do anything. It was at this point I blacked out and have no idea what happened the rest of the day, but apparently I had two more tests that day, and also apparently I got an A on all three tests I took that day.
262	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
263	I have moderate autism (aspergers) and ADHD and smoking weed actually makes life better for me. Sometimes I am socially isolated and rather just be with myself, but some weed every 3-7 days makes me help understand it better. I'll explain one time that was amazing.
264	I pick up my little metal bowl and pack it, savor the smell and realize its only the beginning. I spark the bowl.
265	I am pretty high. I start to notice my surroundings, I stand up and laugh.
266	Wow, I think. It was creeper weed, I underestimated it. I started to notice talking in full sentences was getting to be a challenge, but it was fun. I was becoming more clumsy than I usually am. I am talking to myself like crazy, more than I usually do when I'm not under the influence. 
267	I'm having so much fun letting my imagination go wild with myself, it was like I was sitting there and facing another of me and talking to him. I decide that if I want to have more fun, I'm going to need to smoke some more weed. After that, I'm completely smashed, train wreck in the face.
268	I felt so retarded, as in mentally retarded. I feel so stupid, I felt helpless, but there was that feeling of fun still lingering there. I felt as if this was permanent for about 15 minutes, I was paranoid, but I still felt like it was fun. All of a sudden, my ears are in complete pain. (I have high frequency hearing loss, I cannot hear noises above 7500Khz. Any noise above what I can hear causes me pain.) I faintly remember that I had a dog whistler app on my brothers iPod touch, I must have accidentaly activated it. Fuck me, ouch.
269	T+2:00 I'm still retarded, I could barely talk, though It was hilarious. Anytime I tried to talk, It felt like my mouth kept tripping on its own words, so everything just sounded like jumbled blahs. I somehow managed to go downstairs and make a glass of iced tea. I don't know how I managed to do that the way I was. I started to feel like a kid again. I felt like I had the mentality of a five year old. Wow, It was getting interesting.
270	I'm coming down now, but I still feel good, I'm sitting around thinking about meeting one of my friends, of the few that I have. I thinking about what we were gonna do. (He has autism too but he's 12 so I did not think it would be a good idea to introduce him into the wonderful world of weed, and I did not know how to handle handle him sometimes. You get the point). My mind was drifting and I went to grab a cigarette.
271	Autism and weed are a good mix for me. I've had other things happen but I don't feel like going into detail now. For others its a bad condition but for me, I love it. I never really cared about all the social bs. What I lack in social skills I make up in intelligence, and for me that is 100% true.

273	I was at job corps in San marcos TX. I was bored so me and some friends decided to smoke a joint. I smoked it with little resistance since I love weed. After About 10 minutes I felt the full effect of the weed. I always start to notice colors more when I'm high. It seems like every one is in a spirtual battle. The side they are on is showed by the color they wear. For example red means bloods. Yes I'm talking about the gang. They tend to worship the devil. Blue represents crip. They worship god and want to kill all bloods. Black represents the creater of the universe. When I'm high it's like I'm in a battle. My thoughts are project into other peoples mind. They know exactly what I'm thinking.

276	My friend and I smoked 2 pretty fat joints and were sitting in a parking lot when I had a revalation. What if air distorted images simular to water or heat. So I sat and contemplated for about 20 minutes and came to the conclusion that air causes our eyes to distort but since we have been living so long with air in the atmosphere that we have adapted in the way that fish adapt to seeing through the distorion of water. It would be the exact same if we lived in darkness for the duration of our existence. Our eyes and ears would adapt to the darkness and enable us to move around. This thought process tripped me out in a great way and I enjoyed the rest of my night trying to grab the air and hold it.

279	I baught a sack of schwag one time when I was a n00bie to marijuana, and I was about to go on a road trip.  I didn't have time to smoke the bag, so I poored the weed in my mouth, chewed and swallowed it.  It was about 3 grams I ate.  In about an hour I started feeling stoned.  During the next 8 hours of the trip I passed out several times.  Music sounded great.  When we got to our destination, I wasn't making sense to many people and didn't get a lot of the things they were saying.  I was VERY stoned.  After 10 hours had gone by since I ate it, I passed out for the night.  I felt kind of slow the next day.

282	For over six months I have enjoyed pot tea. I use 1/8 ounce pot and 500 milliliters of water. I bring the water to a rolling boil and boil the pot for 30 seconds. I strain it and let it cool and drink it. If I drink it all I will not drive. I usually drink 250 milliliters. I thought of adding a little corn oil or milk to bond with the thc/cannabanoids.

285	Setting: In my room with computer, when listening to music it's with headphones. I was chatting to a fellow tripper and good friend on MSN he was tripping on different shit, but he knew wot I was going through. room was dimly lit if computer screen is turned off. no-one was physically with me. 
286	Time: Approx 3:00am - 5:45am, I was VERY tired before smoking.
287	Before I start - this was my first time smoking bud (very young leaves with seeds) they have much more THC than normal, which is why only 2.5 cones did it for me. This trip is also quite unusual for cannibus and surprised me alot! All I did was relax and let the ganja take the reigns for a bit... enjoy!
288	-------------------------------------------------------------------
289	Hello, my experiences with Ganja before this day have been merely mellow experiences which get me in a nice comfortable mood, nothing could have prepared me for the MINDBLOWING PERSPECTIVE CHANGING experience this super Ganja gave me. I felt the trees encase my head, my mind. My brain was the soil for the plants, I truly felt that, and I suddenly understood what 'change in conciousness' meant... 
290	I'll start with probably the simplest thing to explain - flying :D. At the very beginning, sitting down (BEST position for tripping) my head was REALLY heavy, yet I was floating. This ain't notin like flying tho! Lets move to third person camera. He's sitting, eyes just fully closed while head tilted down and back bent down. Slowly his head tilts up and back with it, smile widening, eyebrows raising, laughing like he's on one a ride at a theme park. He looks like a damn fewl. hehe.
291	Back to first camera my head continues to raise (note: not I raised my head) back to normal sitting back in my chair position, then further back till I couldn't move it back any further. While my head has been moving back, I have been flying higher and higher. When my head tilted full back I was flying so high!! and I felt the falling/flying sensation, that tension. Hope you know what I mean. Laughing FIT while my head was in full back tilt. Could not stop laughing. Tried to explain it to my friend while having a laughing fit, which eventually reverted to a huge smile. :D
292	At one point I felt my hands were just automatically typing without me thinking, and the computer was responding to my messages. I didn't feel like I was chatting to a person anymore (this computer responding perspective didn't last too long). This is when I felt my mind seperate from my body. They were seperate entities with separate purposes. I had a vision of my dark mind and my dark body (separate), my mind remotely telling my body what to do. Wierd, hard to explain feeling. But it was actually quite profound. I would've thought a spirit/body separation would be more likely, which was half why it felt quite strange indeed. 
293	I felt a bit closer to the dude I was talking to while tripping, I started calling him 'bro' which I never usually do, and I felt it was totally necessary for me to call him that, cos we had this full on connection throughout this time. I know if it had been someone else, they would have had such a hard time dealing with me in that state.
294	I tried lying down on my bed. Getting into the totally relaxed mood, I started feeling and hearing my blood trickle through my body. I knew exactly which route it was taking cos I could feel it, and this was complimented my some subtle trickling noise and another sound (can't remember) for when it was being pumped by my heart. 
295	Although I didn't think it at the time, I'm pretty sure MOST of the reason I had such a good trip was because I was talking to someone who knew EXACTLY what I wanted to hear at the right time and who I could report back to every time I returned from a trip. I took for granted the safety he gave me, but now I realise. Also when my focus moved to my blood flow, I was told to keep off the blood, instead focus on energy flow. Right then I could see the doors leading to dark places revealed and I was lucky to leave before I entered any. Energy flow is a really positive thing to focus on.
296	The most puzzling moment was during the first peak. The lighting was dim as I had turned off my monitor. I relaxed (well, I couldn't really help that heh) and my eyes became very unfocussed, half-closed, in fact, almost closed. Then funny things started happening, the keyboard 'evolved' and so did the faint white lines on my adidas pants, and any other dimly lit stuff just became something really interesting. And I wasn't in 3D anymore, I was in 4D. I felt like my mind was pushed so hard, it was just on the verge of seeing clear 4D, but since my brain isn't used to it, it could make much sense of it. Still, it was very different to 3D - VERY interesting.
297	this wasn't the most freaky part tho. After a while of a ride through 4D, well actually it happened near the start too - displacement. Where I was in relation to everything around me changed. Quite suddenly at first. When I was coming back from the trip, my vision slowly gradually focused. And when it was back in full focus, I freaked! well not really, it was more a puzzled 'Whaaaat the fuuuuck!' (I was laughing while saying it, so there wasn't fear).
298	Now this is very hard to explain properly, but the best I can do is say I felt like I was in a mirror image of where I was before tripping. It was SOOO puzzling, I just couldn't believe my eyes, I thought I had come back to the wrong place, and I'd have to trip again, then try to return to my normal state. The keyboard was on the left of me now. HOW!!!!!! I definitely didn't move and yet it is true. I was seeing clearly, but my whole ROOM was rearranged as a mirror image. Even slightly different to mirror image. Now that was freaky. And it isn't the best description, but it'll have to do. All it took for me to regain a more normal (well STONED normal) vision and perception was rotate my head from side to side looking both directions.
299	Probably the most amusing dream/vision I had during this trip was this: I was flying through a jungle - one with trees that had the most vibrant colors in their leaves. All my favourite colors everywhere!! Then there was this HUGE orange cheesel and I flew right through it! It was siiiiick flying through that hole. Cos dey my fav snack. I think I told the dude I was tripping with that I flew through a cheetos, but dey phukin spherical hehe! 
300	Music - Sound VERY FUCKING DIFFERENT. Hard Bass kicks were very sounding soft, mellow and comforting to my ears. I wanted to hear some sub-bass though cos I felt that would give me so much satifaction - but all I had was headphones. Music becomes VERY 3D! It is much more free and real. BTW this is the first time I've listened to full on dance music with thumpin bass while stoned. Usually I'm listening to more chill music - dnb or mellow shit.
301	vaio - Rapture (Deep Dish Remix) - This is a good one cos I played this not long before I got stoned. Played this over a couple of times, the kicks were very nice, I understood the singing a great deal more - the 'la la la la' parts I could even understand what she was saying there. (I have shit memory of the rest of the details soz)
302	HOUSE MUSIC PLEASE!!!! It's trippy because of the combination of the artists playing with these things: eq filter, resonance, panning. These three simple things together is the recipe for a headfuck on ganja!! An example of house music I played is roger sanchez - another chance. Quite an enjoyable house track, but totally trippy when ur fucked. I'll never forget the first 2 seconds of the track, the artist uses the recipe above to the max - kinda subtle since it's only the first 2 secs, but it literally moved me in the chair and my brain was being skewed by it. Made me real dizzy, it was so satisfying to understand and feel music so well.
303	Analog Pussy - Shperma Pornomatic, this song ALWAYS SOUNDS good, stoned or not, but when stoned it sounded alot 'warmer' and the 'waaaho!' vocals were really bloody enjoyable. amazing stuff.
304	The only thing I'm dissapointed about is I didn't get to try all the things I wanted, cos I wasn't thinking clearly. For so long I didn't even listen to music - but even then it was VERY fun and interesting. If I could add to the experience, I would have listened to the 'headfuck' directory of my collected Infected mushroom tracks. I know they would have fucked me up. I could try it next time, but I dunno if things will be as intense or the same.

307	I was tested at my worksite and failed miserably. Though I never go to work under the influence of any drugs. As a regular user using everyday I initially tested with a THC level of 90 ng/ml. Almost double the allowed concentration. After eight days clean I was re-tested at a level of 48.5 ng/ml. On the quick test I was deemed negative. I hope that these test results will help.

310	Two very close friends and I were staying in a large rented caravan/mobile home for four nights at a small campsite in the New Forest area of England.  The village we stayed in is a tiny, picturesque location complete with a nice country pub and village green, which is occupied by a few wild horses during the day.  Despite coming here twice before, we still thought of ourselves as strangers in this small, isolated, rural community.  It kind of reminded me of old Western films where three horsemen would arrive in a small outback town, causing suspicion and edginess amongst the locals.  Except our horses were bikes  we were there to go mountain biking in the surrounding forest area, you see. 
311	Now Ive set the scene, lets get down to the fun part  the night in question.  We started the evening getting slightly drunk in the caravan and smoking a few joints.  We then headed down to the village pub where we proceeded to drink some more (Jack Daniels as I remember), and make acquaintance with the local laydeez of the village.  Once closing time came we all headed to a house party just down the road from the pub and somehow managed to blag our way in.  There was talk going round of a geezer hanging around outside selling ecstasy, and my friend and I wasted no time in obtaining some of these pills.  Once we had these pills in our hands we began to get quite apprehensive.  It was to be the first time for both of us but there was no going back now so we downed them and had some cheap wine.  Roughly half an hour later, the effects were getting quite noticeable for me and I had the sudden urge to start dancing like a maniac in the middle of the living room floor of this guys house who I didnt even know.  My friend at this point was in the bathroom doing I dont know what so I went into the garden for some fresh air and a brief sit down.  
312	There were some dogs in the garden running around in an enclosed fenced area, and I was getting bored waiting for my friend still in the bathroom, so I decided to feed the dogs.  This involved me carrying armloads of canned dog food from the fridge inside out into the garden to hurl into the dog area.  And this is where it all started to get a bit surreal.
313	I remember making my way out into the front garden of the house and seeing a police car pull up outside.  This brought on a sudden, intense wave of paranoia in me and being the first person he saw, the police officer strolled up to me and started asking questions about noise levels, shouting, things like that.  I blabbered my way through this interrogation with some ease and the officer went inside.  At this point the paranoia really started to creep in.  I had a feeling that everyone was looking for me, for punishing me for every bad thing I had ever done in my life.  Although this might sound like a bad trip to you, I was actually enjoying it as I felt like a James Bond character  everybody looking to kill him, but always staying one step ahead.  The adrenalin rush was like no other I had ever experienced.
314	I was feeling overwhelmed by all the action and so I went back to our caravan alone to get some more weed to mellow me out a bit.  I did this ok but upon returning to the party I decided not to go back in but to head opposite to the village green instead, and watch the action from a safe viewpoint all by myself.  I sat under a tree in total darkness and began to roll and smoke a few joints.  After two joints I remember babbling incoherently like a fool and I must have collapsed or something.
315	I awoke and looked at my watch  it was 5am.  I headed back to the caravan where my friends were fucking around with the TV set or something and I sat down calmly.  I then burst into a full rendition of most of my favourite songs and went to bed.  The singing was especially satisfying as I was feeling like a rock star or something, and that was good.  I like singing when Im wasted anyway.
316	So thats that.  The next day I didnt feel too bad, didnt have a hangover, felt quite good actually, but a bit sick.  Im surprised I can remember so many details of this night but it was all good, like a chapter out of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

319	I had just gotten out of work on a Saturday night and I pulled my usual routine of calling around to see whats happening in my small suburban town. A friend told me to meet him at a park where a few of our mutual friends had gathered to drink and smoke, a girl, lets call her cindy, was sniffing vodka through her nose, several other girls were drinking beers, and I and a few other male friends were playing 20 questions.
320	The Only marijuana available at the park was bricked out dirt weed which i had acquired a quarter pound of the week before. I refused to smoke this as I wasn't sure what percentage of it was actually marijuana. Thus began the search for high potency buds. Within 15 minutes a connect had been established and buds were on the way, we purchased 3 dub sacks and a eighth for a total of 110$. I recieved my 20 bag and we departed for the park.
321	Once we got to the park the gravity bong was filled and it was time to get started, now, this was the first time I got a good look at this weed, and it was beautiful. the bong was packed up and as I lit up and started raising the hitter, the milky white smoke filled the chamber quickly and smoothly. I removed the top and went down on the bottle thrusting 2 liters of thick smoke deep into my lungs. I quickly was knocked out, coughing and heaving but still down for another hit. I repeated this 5 times until the bowl was kicked. and started my journey towards the basketball courts.
322	I paid attention to nothing anyone said. My life had turned into a documentary, like 'This is Your Life' and I had no control over what I was doing. I could hear my voice narrating the events as they happened and i had completely lost touch of reality. Due to the fact that there was a young lady at the park I had the previous intention of hooking up with, it was of upmost importance to keep in touch with reality and not look like a moron. I was shit out of luck, as i stumbled into the car and the music turned on my life became the music. My heartbeat was moving to the beat of the music and my mind was enthralled in the deep bass of the song 'SIOSOS' by the Spooks.
323	I tried telling myself i was coming down but the fact was I was in another world. I convinced myself the marijuana was laced with Acid or PCP, and i started to get visuals. This was the first and only time I have ever experienced visuals with marijuana use, and they were powerful. The stoplights were bouncing to the music and whenever something miraculous like this happened I would experience a 'Mindgasm' the only way I can begin to describe it would be if you were traveling at 2000 mph, flipping through space. Your world collapses and everything around you becomes unreal. It is a relieving feeling but if it occurs too many times, it could induce vomiting. We arrived at Wendys and i purchased a 5 piece chicken and a Biggie Fry. This was a very smart move. The food started to give me a grip on what was going on. Which was good. The documentary voice was telling me that I should play the roll of the 'shy guy' in order to play off the mind games that were destroying my sanity. So I watched out the window, experiencing several more mindgasms before we reached my car.
324	I drove my car home subconciously as I wasn't aware of anything but the road directly in front of me. Successfully dropped off the girls and headed home. I started to come down T+4:00 after the experience and was finally able to attain a deep sleep. The experience, although a bit nauseating at times, was amazing and enlightening. I will savor the remaining buds and hope to share this experience and pass on my story to others. I strongly suggest marijauna for everyone that hasnt done it yet, as it is a wonderful substance and has changed my life for the better.

327	So I've been quite a smoker for a time now but this would be the first time I smoked a real bong. It all started with that I went over to my friends house to smoke some ZeroZero (good hashish). We always just roll one joint not two, we roll the other one when we feel like we need some more. Anyway my friend is da bomb at rollin' joints, he really is, we call him the Professor.
328	So he made one and we smoked it, this is big papers, not regular so it's like maybe 1 gram in one joint. And we got stoned, after a while we thought let's make another one so we did and smoked that too, now we were really stoned. And then a couple of friends arrived with more hashish, and they made a water pipe, so we smoked maybe 3 hits of that pipe. Now we all were really stoned, more stoned than before. So we just chilled while talking and stuff, and then a friends mobile phone rang and he answered it. After he had hung up he told us that our 'drug dealer' was coming to visit us with even more hashish, he said that he would bring a bong.
329	And then my friend said that he didn't think that I could make it, smoking a bong that is, so I said oh yeah? let's make a bet, 2 dollars on that I can, he agreed. Then the dealer came and pulled the bong from a bag and laid it on the table, while he was mixing some hashish. He first took the hit, then it was my turn. He said just inhale like hell, and I did, and I thought this isn't that bad...then I heard his voice telling me to let go of the hole.
330	So I let it go, and there was so much smoke that it came up again without exhaling it. So I started to cough, and all my friends started to laugh their lungs out and I ran to the bathroom and just coughed in the toilet. Then it was over I went to lay down on my friends bed, I felt like something told me to go to the bathroom again, so I did. And just when I got in I puked my hamburger that I had eaten earlier right up, so it wasn't that bad because it still tasted like hamburger. But after a while I was soo totaly lost I was laying on the side on the toilet just trying to get things straight again, I was really tired. And then all suddenly I saw a big shining bathtub, I thought that it would be great to lay down there, but then I realised how 'junkie' it would be so I stayed where I were, near the toilet :)
331	After a while I looked up again and I was lying on the floor, but there were no bathtub there. I didn't realise that I was halucinating so I just walked to my friends again.
332	After a while me and my friend left, I don't have a single idea how I got home but I did...
333	It might not have been all that fun but it was an experience and I got a small idea how to smoke a bong next time.

336	I had never been so stoned in all my life. Of course, I had never really been stoned. I had been high more than a handful of times, mostly just contact highs but also a couple of times smoking up. Nothing, not even the experiences of my friends, could have prepared me for what happened though. It was crazy.
337	The week before this happened, I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed. I had been on painkillers for a couple of days, but stopped taking them a few days before the 'main event'. My parents were going away for the weekend, so I figured I'd have a house party, just me and some friends, and it ended up lasting a few days. Apparently I have a great backyard for smoking - nobody can see into my back yard unless they are standing in it, which is a plus.
338	Friday night before my parents left, two of my friends came over and smoked a little, and we ended up laughing on the basement floor for a good half hour, why I don't know. But the next day was even better. Saturday night, what a night it was. Me and three guys smoking in my backyard. Something none of us thought we would be doing - nobody thought they'd ever be stoned at my house, hell, nobody thought they'd ever see me stoned! Good girl gone bad, I guess.
339	We smoked so much I think I blacked out on my patio at one point. I remember someone waking me up and we went inside, to watch TV or something. That first time I really felt what it was like being stoned, I didn't say too much. I don't remember much of that particular night. I do remember solving the Rubik's cube. I can solve it sober in about 3 minutes, but I tried it stoned - it was the only thing I could focus on for whatever amount of time it took me to solve it. But it kept me in touch with reality, when everything else was wavy and jumpy and slow all at the same time. The volume of sounds kept changing and the only way I could keep it normal was if people kept talking at a constant rate. Strange.
340	I was having premonitions, jumping time, I don't really know how to describe it other than I saw something happen (pillow hitting a can of soda and spilling it onto the floor) before it happened. This wasn't the first vision, I had seen flashes of a man in a white tee-shirt in the woods on Friday night (before this party), that scared the bejesus outta me. Next thing I know, it's morning, and I'm still out of it. But feeling the need, the need for weed. Yes. So one of my friends (who had brought his stash for us to use) packed a bowl and we went back outside to smoke some more. That hit me fast, but not as badly as the night before, and it was a lot more fun. I definitely said a lot more this time. Even later that day I invited some more friends over and we smoked up some more.
341	It thundered that day. I kept yelling that the thunder was trying to get into my house to steal my pop tarts. I had a discussion with my friend about the difference between real soda and 'mind soda'. The whole time I had this incredibly distorted sense of touch. I was asking people if I was moving my hand because I couldn't feel it moving (though apparently it was moving). I knocked soda cans over and walked into a table and didn't even feel it. This feeling didn't wear off for days.
342	Wednesday, parents are back, I'm paranoid that the house smells like weed but nobody notices it except for me so I'm playing it cool. I cleaned up the mess from the party (over 30 soda cans, and the remnants of three days of the munchies) before they returned. But the feeling is still lingering with me. I feel fizzly. You know those fireworks that make the fizzling, sssssssssss, frying pan noise? That's what I feel like. If someone touches my arm with one finger, I feel it all through my arm, sort of like pins and needles only not as painful and a lot longer lasting. I scratch my face and then put my arm back down and I'm not sure if I ever really scratched my face. It's cool but at the same time freaky.
343	If I've learned anything from this, it's got to be don't smoke too much at one time. It's not as fun if you black out. And keep more food in the house. Munchies are bad if you have no food to eat (I think I bit someone because I was hungry). Some people say life is just a bowl of cherries - we say life is just a cherried bowl. Can't wait for my parents to go out of town again.

346	The story begins when my brother got back from college for his winter break and had brought back a film canister full of nugs.  His drug of choice had always been alcohol, so he wasn't that reluctant to hand the canister on to me for a small fee.  I gave him a 20, grabbed the canister, and left to pick up a few friends.
347	Once I had picked three kids up, it was about 8 pm and we decided to stop at a parking lot to light up.  My friend, Allen, brought his sweet glass pipe with him and I started to pack a bowl.  It was cold out, being december, so we stood in a circle to help stay warm and keep the wind from blowing out the flame.
348	I was the first one to smoke.  I lit up and inhaled deeply, being the experienced smoker that I am.  This had to of been the hugest hit of my entire life, because it forced me to double over onto the ground and cough the saliva up from the back of my throat.  I managed to pull myself up back onto my feet with the help of two of my friends.  The first thing that I did once on my feet was try to lick my friend Dan's face, since he was so close to me after helping me up.
349	After smoking, my friends thought it would be cool to see Lord of the Rings on it's opening day.  I hopped into the driver's seat and immediately realised that I wouldn't be able to drive us anywhere in my condition.  We all piled out and started playing tag in the parking lot.  I made sure that I didn't run too fast so that I wouldn't trip; it wouldn't have hurt at all then, but i would've felt it in the morning.
350	After tiring ourselves out a litte, we hopped back into the car and headed down towards the movie theatre.  At the time, I was an inexperienced driver and forgot to turn my lights on, even though it was pitch black outside.  On the way there, I think I see the turn off for the movie theatre, so I pull into the left lane.  After a few seconds of bumpy driving, my friend enlightens me to the fact that I'm off the road, which I correct as if it were an everyday occurance.  It wasn't until later that I realised how close to death we'd come.
351	Now I've read all of the Lord of the Rings books and was heavily psyched to see this movie.  After a few confusing happenings buying tickets and seeing friends from school, we get into the movie.  Even if I had been in my right mind, this movie would have been sweet, but after smoking what I had, it was nothing short of a religious experience.  I highly recommend seeing it even without smoking first.

354	This afternoon I had a really strange experience on weed and was wondering if anyone else has had the same thing happen. I have been smoking for about 3 years and I am now 17. Recently (the last 4 months) there hasn't been more than 10 days when I haven't smoked up. I had just gotten off school this lovely Friday afternoon and was looking foward to a nice big session. Me and my mate loaded a couple of cones and started toking. Now this shit I had smiked before. It was quality. It had so many crystals on it and it smelled really potent. Anyway, after the cones were finished my friend went to drop his car home and we were supposed to meet at his place in about 15 minutes to pick him up and go to work. I was sitting on the side of the road waiting for my brother to bring the car home when shit started happening. I was staring at the road in front of me and it started waving like water. I thought this was odd but cool and continued to stare in awe. What happened next was the most awesome open eyed visual display I have experienced. The outline of a cartoon character appeared and then continued to morph into various other characters and objects. I was probably watching this for about 10 minutes and I really was in a world of my own. I then closed my eyes and was welcomed by an amazing array of colourful orbs etc.
355	Anyway. This experience was not a bad one although it was very unexpected. Just wondering what happened and if anyone else has experienced this from smoking weed.

358	It seems that some people seem to have some problems or strange ideas as to how to smoke cannabis oil.
359	In New Zealand one of the most common ways of smoking pot is referred to as 'spotting', using the element of a kitchen stove in combination with knives.  I believe this is referred to as 'hot-kniving' in other parts of the world.
360	The best type of knives to use have non-metal handles.  Bone-handled knives work well, but be careful to not let the handle touch the element, otherwise you'll have a small fire-show in your kitchen :)
361	Turn the element on to full power (this works best with gas or spiral-metal elements) and place the knive as hard against this as possible.  Sometimes a round piece of metal (such as the top of a coffee tin) is used as a hat on top, however this is usually somewhat excessive for Oil.  It usually takes 5-10 mins for the elements to heat up properly (significantly longer with gas)
362	Take a small blob of oil and place it on the end of a needle.
363	You will also require some kind of tube for sucking up the smoke, I would suggest making a makeshift 'straw' out of the top of packet of cigarette papers or something similar.
364	Place the straw in your mouth, and with the other hand pull out the red-hot knife from under the element.  Move the straw towards the end of the knife and begin inhaling slowly.  With your other hand place the blob of oil onto the knife and rub it up and down a little bit.  The oil should bubble a little bit then 'poof' the smoke out.  Make sure you're inhaling a little faster for when it starts smoking.
365	It can take a few attempts to master the timing. But, with a small amount of practise, you can achieve near-perfect 'spots' with almost no wastage at all.
366	It may be easier to get a friend to do the burning (driving) for you, while you concentrate on sucking up all the smoke.

369	I had smoked weed about 7-8 times before this experience.  All of which I had been smoking 'shwag' (low quality weed) and had heard many times about how Kine/Skunk was much better and definitely worth the extra cash. I had also heard that weed, when ingested, gave a slightly different effect and that it strings out your high for as long as 6 hours.  I had ingested low-quality weed orally before, and didn't notice much difference from smoking it.. just a longer high.
370	I finally bought some very high quality weed for the first time and had only smoked it before.. never ingested.  Needless to say 1/2 of a joint of the weed would put me off my ass when it was smoked from... but tonight was a different story.  
371	I was at my apartment and my roommate was away for the week, so I decided i wanted to try to make some cool music (guitar player) whilst i was stoned.. and since i was alone I knew that i wouldn't be bothered.  I thought.. shwag was boring when i ate it... I wonder if this will be the same.... boy was i wrong.
372	I was sitting at the computer chatting with someone right after i had taken it and thought to myself.. it will be 30 minutes or so before this stuff kicks in... so i'll chat for a bit.  Well, 30 minutes rolled around and i didn't feel a damn thing.  I thought.. well shit, its gotta be coming pretty soon!  5 mintues or so after that my friend said something that made me chukle a little. I stretched out breifly & cracked my back and then out of nowhere a feeling came over me.  I started to laugh again at what my friend had said and after what seemed like 2-3 minutes i relized that i was laughing my fucking ass off!  I was laughing so hard i could barely catch my breath.  That time period made me ponder... I thought to myself... Jesus!..  I had laughed for like 3 minutes straight at a comment that wasn't even that funny.  It clicked as though i had forgotten i had eaten the weed 40 minutes ago... ahh i'm stoned now.  I wondered to myself.. I have never had week that hit me so suddenly like that... out of the blue.  
373	All of the sudden i remembered that this was the very high quality weed that i invested my money into.  'Woah' I thought... those guys must have been talking about kine when they said there is a whole new side to being high when you eat it.  
374	It all ten-folded from there.  I was experiencing feeling that I had never felt before when i was high.  Everything was blown way out of proportion.  I grabbed a handfull of chips and started to much on them and thought... my tounge feels awful funny... Hmm.   I chewing the chips i was eathing and started to move my tounge around inside my mouth.  It was the most odd feeling i had ever encountered. It was as if my tounge were partially numb, but its actions FELT inversed.  I would put my tounge on the roof of my mouth and think to myself - Big Al dude.. thats the TOP of your mouth you moron, but the physical side of me was telling me.. No Al... your on the bottom right now.  
375	I started thinking about actions such as these too much and it started to frighten me.  Subconsiously my tounge wouldn't sit still, like it was trying to confuze me and bring my attention back to what i didn't want to think about.  Kinda scary at the time...  -  I then started concetrating more on chatting with my friend online.  He was aware that i was stoned, but i hadn't explained to him yet that I had ingested kine for the first time.  
376	I started to explain to him the conditions of which i was under, but instead i ended up writing him a novel.  I explained in extremely great detail that i had ingested kine bud instead of smoking it.  He replied to me.. 'Woah dude... i know your a perfectionist, but why in the hell did you just type me 3 fully fledged paragraphs about how you ATE the weed and didn't smoke it' ... I tried to understand what he was relaying back to me.  My mind was thinking hundreds of possibilities of different things that were in the front of my mind at the time.  It was almost like listening to a song and breaking it down one instrument at a time, then splicing them back together but to make something new.  My mind was racing.  I thought to myself.. If i am thinking about all of the different sides/perspectives/shapes and forms of things, then how can i benefit from this experience.  
377	CLICK!  -  Music.  I immediately jumped up from my chair, typed out hastily to my friend that i would be back in a bit and rushed over to the guitar.  I stopped for reasons i couldn't understand, looked around the room, and became extreamly scared in the blink of an eye.  Sudennly i had absolutely no interest in music, but wanted to get back with my friend because i was feeling unsafe mentally.  I started telling my friend that i was getting freaked out.  He asked questions in a calm manner to me such as 'tell me what youre feeling right now'... I lashed out at him for no reason saying things like.. 'Fuck you dude... i'm scared shitless.. i feel like i'm gonna die or something!'.  He was calm through the whole ordeal, but i felt like i was going insane.  I started asking myself questions in my head very VERY quickly with answers to none.  'What if i do die'?, 'What if the police find this chatbox after i die'!? Then i thought to myself... wholy shit... i'm so goddamn paranoid i THINK i'm going to die.  That settled my mind and i was very releaved when i come to the thought that i was just really stoned.  Duh AL... your not gonna die, your safe.
378	After that my typing became very hyper... all of the sudden i felt like i had a lot to say, and i had to say it fast.  I made so many spelling errors due to speed and being stoned that my friend kept telling me - your not making sense.  It was all pointless anyhow, and i stepped back from my mind to think about why i was typing fast in the first place.  I had no idea.
379	By now i was about 2 hours into the high and my hyperness turned into hapiness.  Instead of typing faster, i started anylizing the text coming from my friend and could understand concepts much better.  I felt much better now, and then i noticed that the whole time i had forgot about my tounge that had been flailing around in my mouth without me knowing it.  I felt deathly sore in the mouth and my tounge hurt badly.  I grabbed hold of a mountain dew next to me and took a swig... WARM! Nasty!!! I thought... shit - i had better get a cold one.  I walked out of my room and headed to the fridge when i saw my roomate's cat sitting the floor. I looked in the fridge and found a dew, closed the fridge and saw something out of the corner of my eye.  It scared the shit out of me - I looked over quickly and saw it was the cat i had just seen.  VERY werid feeling like my extreme short term memory was going out on me. 
380	The cold dew was better, but still didn't taste that great. I sat back down at the computer and my friend said 'lets go play some starcraft' ... i was quite hesitant at first and told him that it may make me freak out again.. but he was in the mood so i went along with it.  I had an absolute blast. I was laughing my ass off the whole time.. commanding my men to kill eachother and whatnot.  It was such a great feeling knowing that i could put these charachters through hell and nobody would be hurt.  Needless to say we lost the game.  I had told my friend 'i think my high is coming down now'.   He departed and i logged off and went to sleep thinking of all the COMPLETELY different experiences i felt in comparison to when i had ingested shwag.
381	The whole week after that i had a different look on things...  everyone i saw and all the things i thought of were totally different than before.  This slowly decreased and i became myself after the weeks period was through.  I think it may have been what i would like to call a 'temporary life-changing experience'... i'm not sure.

384	The night started out ok, with nothing to worry about.  My friend showed up at my house with some brownie mix and the weed.  We made the brownies and called a couple people to see what they were doing.  Two of them couldn't do anything and the other one was pretty indecisive.  We went ahead and ate a brownie and start getting some sort of effects.  I must say that it didn't taste too terrific.  The stems and seeds tend to add a bit of crunchiness to them.  I think all we did at first was just laugh; nothing too exciting.  After awhile we ate two more, wanting better effects.  We soon started to get very confused about everything.  One of us would be talking and suddenly stop what we were saying, due to the fact that we just plain forgot what we were talking about.  This happened numerous times throughout the night.  Both our bodies were very numb, but in a pleasant way.  I almost felt like if I tried to get up I wouldn't be able to.  I guess I did, because my friend had to go home, so I let her out the door.  
385	I then proceeded get online and find something to do.  I hadn't been on the computer for more than 10 minutes, when everything went wrong.  I thought that my friend was still in my house, and when I turned around, she wasn't there.  I thought she might be in the other room.  This is where I thought I got up from the computer and searched around the house.  I was either thinking, or saying out loud, 'Where is ****, where did she go?'  The next thing that happened was I was simply sitting at the computer thinking to myself, 'Oh yeah, she went home.'  I thought that she might be hurt somewhere and didn't make it home.  I finally had to call her just to make sure she was ok.  
386	I also started to think I was doing all this stuff and then I would realize that I hadn't moved from where I was.  I felt so lost, and was really scared.  I kept thinking that something had to be wrong; I shouldn't be scared from just a little bit of weed.  I decided to lie down on my bed and attempt to fall asleep, which is what I must have done.  I also think that my heart was beating really hard sometimes throughout that night.    
387	When I woke up I felt like I had done a bunch of hard drugs the night before.  I looked in the mirror and realized that I looked horrible.  I'm still really tired right now as I write this; it's only the day after.  I'm not sure I'd want to eat another weed brownie again if I'm going to be thinking that I'm talking to people and doing stuff that I'm not.  Being scared and thinking that your friend might be hurt and you don't know where she is, can be really frightening.

390	One day me and two of my friends went into a nature center to smoke this new weed that one of the friends just got. This was the best stuff I had ever smoked! After only three hits, I went insane. At first I started laughing uncontrollably, which always happens. Then as we were walking through the paths, my vision started to blink vertically instead of the normal horizontal (when blinking). All the colors everywhere became very amazing and bright, but that was nothing. Now about five minutes have passed with straight laughter, and then I noticed that it sounded as if all sound was coming directly to my ears, and not traveling through the air. this was an amazing sensation to me. 
391	After we all piled into the van, we drove off to find a place to skate.  While we were at a red light, I went into a trip where I thought i was talking out my window to a ticketman in his ticket booth. While talking to him about who knows what, I remember holding onto a pet alligator and petting it. Then right before the light turned green, I woke up to find that my pet alligator had dissapeared! I yelled out to my friends,'where did my pet alligator go?!' as if they knew. Then I explained to them what had just happened while we were at the red light. They just laughed at me and we drove on. 
392	Then they stoped at a Hardees to get something to eat. They decided to keep me in the van because it wouldn't be a good idea to bring me inside, because I was still laughing non-stop. While they were inside, I imagined a rabbid bunny jumping out from behind a bush and attacking an ant. They came back to the van to find me still laughing it up. I told them the story, but they couldn't understand because I was mumbling and laughing way too much.
393	We found a good place to skate, but I was too tired to get out of the van. so my friends had to drag me out and set me on the grass. They skated for a while, while I just sat there watching them and laughing about the crazy noises I was hearing. Then a security guard came along and shoed us away. I was careful enough to keep it straight, but it was extemely hard. After that we just drove home and wait a bit till I came down, so then I could tell them my whole story and they could tell me what they thought about it.

396	I parked my car at the entrance to the Rainbow Falls bush track, and sparked up a joint of good bud. I thought I'd better leave my intake at 4 tokes 'cos I'd had bad experiences with weed lately due to spinal problems and weird skull sensations.
397	I do a lot of walking (while stoned) in the beautiful bush/river tracks around my area. It is a very healthy and enjoyable activity alone or with good company. The Rainbow Falls track runs alongside a beautiful river and is surrounded by native and introduced bush. It is one of three areas I frequent.
398	As I descended into the forest, I felt a deep respect for the ancient moss-covered natural rock walls, and emerged into the clearing where the huge falls can be viewed. The power was immense, and I felt the huge downwards force having an effect on me, but then I noticed the spray lifting up and floating away - forces balanced, and I picked myself up again. Some (Dutch? German?) tourists looked at me and looked scared and nervous - I don't know why (I don't think it was weed paranoia) - I looked normal and was wearing normal clothing - shit, I even smiled at them, but their reactions made me feel bad, unwelcome in my homeland. I tried to ignore it and made my way further down the track.
399	Passing more angry/frightened tourists who volunteered nothing but sneers and timid glances, I was starting to have a bad buzz. My spinal/cranial pains were playing up, and my mood was worsening. I continued down the track and came upon a grove of strange, ancient trees. Suddenly, it was all clear - the destructive force inside me was attacking me (I had been training hard in my Taekwondo all week), and possibly it showed through and scared the tourists on some level, too. I felt I had to give some of it to the trees, so I spread my fingers and let it drain out through my arms. This felt right. I also felt the trees reward me by soothing my mood and my body. It was like a trade of my destructive potential energy for their healing.
400	After this turning point, my buzz picked right up. I passed some American tourists, a couple wearing bright parkas, and greeted them as I did the others, and they gave me warm greetings back - they weren't scared!
401	I then decided I wanted to be close to the water, so I cruised down to the river and picked out a good place to sit on the flat stones in the middle. I sat there for an hour, basking in the gentle sun peeking through the canopy, contemplating the nature of water and the trade I had just made. I felt good to be alive. I thanked nature and made my way back up the track.
402	On my way back, I contemplated what things would be like if social structures were different. What if we still had Kings and Knights and Druids? Surely it would be fitting, I thought, to follow the ways of these majestic forests? It seems that as we've 'advanced,' people's minds have become blunted or desensitised to this underlying magic in nature, and using certain drugs is one way to recapture and experience this beauty - if only for a short time.

405	One day after work my friend and I decided to smoke some new kind bud that he just picked up a few days before. He told me that this stuff was strong, but being an experienced smoker I thought nothing of it.  We got to his house and his wife decided to toke with us. So I had a seat on the couch and he started to roll a nice jay. After rolling it, we proceeded to smoke this bad boy, of course passing it in session between the three of us. By the time the jay was gone I could not believe the quality of the bud, my head was seriously spinning.
406	This was different to me, most of the time I gotta smoke at least three jays to get where I was. He broke out his pipe, which didn't suprise me any, as I figured we were going to smoke more. He packed about 20 roaches in the pipe and me and him smoked them, and then he packed 2 bowls of the kind bud. Needless to say, I was baked, standing up not possible. We started to watch tv and got tired of it quickly. We ended up going and playing pool at a local bar, I could hardly make a shot much less order drinks. I ended up messing up the drink order and we all had soda. So we went over to my friend's house and sat there and played video games.
407	The buzz had begun at 11:00 am and we left the bar at about 12:45, and the rest of the time we played video games. I ended up looking at some of my friend's art that he had on the wall, and someone came over and started to talk to me. I asked them what time it was because I had to be somewhere at 4:00. They said it was 10:30. I said, 'What the hell, it's not 10:30, quit messing with me.' But it actually was 10:30 and I ened up missing some important dates, but oh well, I was too baked to care. We had been smoking while playing the games, about 4 more bowls.
408	Well, I guess I would have to say never underestimate the true power of good bud and always keep an eye on what time it is in case you need to be somewhere. I was almost in a time warp when I was looking at his artwork and the only reason I asked what time it was was because it felt like only 20-30 min.

410	If anyone is looking for some music to listen to when you're stoned, I have the perfect song:  'The End' by the Doors.  Let me tell you, listen to this song, and tell me if the same thing happens to you:
411	I was lying on my friend's bed, getting ready for the song to come on. The lights were out, except for a lava lamp in the corner.  The first few measures of the song sound like they are literally going in one ear, colliding with your brain, and then exiting the other ear.  Then Jim starts singing. It is like you're walking up the stairway to heaven. You can picture yourself walking up a golden staircase, with little angel children playing the instruments all along the sides of the stairs. All along the staircase there are trees of gold and candy.  Jim Morrison is like God, calling you to heaven. I picture myself wearing this white dress with sparkles all over, and a crown of flowers. Finally, you have reached heaven, and you hear birds chirping, almost like you're in a field of flowers. If you concentrate hard enough, it almost feels like you're flying.
412	Suddenly, the song changes. It's like all your sins have culminated, and 'God' realizes it, and starts you on your way to hell. The music gets creepy, and the birds die out slowly.  It felt like I was falling. I literally felt something pulling me downward.  Jim starts singing, only it's more like yelling. He is now more of a satan character.  The images in your head go from being white and gold, to red and black. The force that pulls you is so intense, it is the most amazing experience.
413	So, now that you all think I'm crazy, try listening to this song when you're stoned, and get back to me on the results :).

416	Originally searching for hashish, I was instead offered opium.  Knowing that opium is black or brown I contested the authenticity of this dark red solid covered in red powder.  Regardless I would try it.  The first time was with low grade marijuana in a glass pipe.  The effects were strictly cannabis.  I doubted the red rock at that point and was planning vengence.  Conversely, the next experience - same cannabis, same pipe - was eventfull to say the least.  The rock was not crushed and simply placed upon the cannabis.  Immediately after smoking I entered my car to return home.  It was night time.  Soon - approximately 2 minutes - my perception darkened and I realized quickly that I was in no shape to drive, but proceeded anyway.  Driving on a road I cover every day I couldn't recognize where I was.  I would see (hallucinate) a person running across the street.  This seemed real to the point that I reacted accordingly and hit the brakes.  Then I was convinced that I was driving in the opposite direction.  The road was well lit, yet I was having great difficutly  seeing the objects surrounding me and the road.  I feared I would crash.  
417	I returned home - I can't remember the details of how - and layed down.  I was suffering from visual impairment.  I began listening on my discman to URB vol. 1.  Strangely the only track I could listen to was Goldie's Innercity.  I attempted to listen to some of the others but was forced to return to Goldie.  The music sounded different; I could hear sounds I hadn't recoginized before.  The singer's voice had me hypnotized.  This was a euphoric feeling.  I had lost my anxiety over the strange new feeling and was now at ease enjoying the sound.  Remembering a friend's story of how opium helped him have intense sex for hours, I decided to masturbate.  When I finally ejaculated the feeling was too intense.  My body reacted as having experienced an attempted resuscitation with shock pads.  I felt my consciousness hover above where I was laying. Then I was enveloped by a black hole.  Everything darken and I felt asleep, yet fully conscious.  Throughout this experience I believed I might have been dying.  I did not fight, just passively accepted.  Suddenly I awoke and had reason to believe that only 10 minutes had passed.  
418	Indeed this was a frightning experience.  I am now aware of red rock not being an opiate, but have not an explanation for my experience.

421	This experience has many question marks. I still do believe that there was some reaction of some kind that caused it. However, the experience itself was really something else. I have never used LSD or any other psychedelics except for a pill of MDMA (Mitsubishi) two weeks before this experience. 
422	That night I went to my friend's house (who, by the way, is a doctor in psychology, with several writings on cannabis) and we decided to rent a couple of movies and smoke our way through the night. We cooked and ate as well as had a bottle of a horrible white wine. The joints were coming and going and by the end of the first movie I was really stoned. Everything was 'normal.' At that point my friend decided that we had to do this bong sort of thing he calls the drainer. So we did with a good amount of pure skunk each. I went well off at that point. Really really stoned, I crawled on the couch and we were getting ready for the second movie. 
423	Then I started shivering as if it was extremely cold. I had felt this side-effect before, so did not care much and it left quickly. At this point, instead of the movie, we started chatting, talking about how stoned we were. Suddenly I felt so strange. I could not really explain, but it was as if the effects of cannabis were strengthened tenfold. My friend asked if I was well. That was it, I just took off. I had no perception of space (including gravity) or time. I started calling out for help as I was drawn into a vortex of some kind, as everything was spinning around me with incredible force. I panicked and I felt like I was going to pass out. My heartbeat was strong and fast and I was breathing very hard. I could hardly feel my limbs, as they were all going numb and I got really scared at this point. My understanding of reality was also very different than usual; I cannot really define it. However, something was very wrong. I tried to focus. There was no way I could. I laid on the couch, which looked huge, and I was feeling like an insect on it. That was another effect - my size in space was no longer a constant, it was relative to my feelings. My friend offered to make me a coffee as I laid on the bed, I could hear his every move and every little sound. The sugar falling in the cup and the sound of the teaspoon was so annoying. I started feeling better. For just a few seconds. But there it came again, taking me into this vortex of paranoia and insanity. 
424	Weird thoughts start crossing my mind. I became a little bit aggressive, started shouting. I quickly called a taxi and left the place. The taxi ride was about 3 minutes. It felt like aeons passed. The taxi driver was talking to me and his voice was coming with echo. I looked at him and he was miles away from me. By then I was in my room. Had a shower, called my girlfriend and went to bed. The feeling was there, but I was coming down. I woke up the next day only to find that I was steel feeling it. It was completely gone by the afternoon. I had another joint then, just to check. It didn't came back, everything was 'normal' again. My 'normal' is a bit different than it used to be before that. I thought I was too close to insanity. I had no visuals of any kind except from faulty space perception and distorted objects. No closed eye visuals.

427	I am going to describe to you the effects of the first time I ever became extremely high.  Hopefully, this will help you decide whether or not to try marijuana.  I, as you will find out, suggest you do.
428	It wasnt the first time I had smoked marijuana.  I have, other times, smoked from both pipes and doobies.  However, the effect hadnt been worth the time spent smoking it.  I think, however, that this was because I did not know how to partake of the herb.  In other words, I was inhaling wrong.  One must breathe it in, not suck.  Inhale from your lungs, not your mouth.  Suck it down until it starts to itch.  You may want to cough.  Dont.  Stop the hoot, and pass the pipe off, without exhaling.  Suck in some air quickly, so that your throat doesnt itch as much.  Hold the smoke in your lungs, not your cheeks, for about ten seconds, maybe longer, and then exhale slowly.  Breathe a bit.  
429	I cant tell you how much to smoke.  I am lean, 511, 165lbs, I repeat, thin.  Doesnt sound thin, but I am bone and muscle.  No fat.  I think because of this, I need more to be very high, because there is less tissue for the THC to hang out in.
430	This time, I had about a thimble full of marijuana, chopped up.  Its hard to describe how much I had, as the common measurements (an eighth, a half-bag) change depending on where you are on the planet.  I had enough to make a small pile in your palm, about one inch high, one inch wide.  I got two bowls out of it, but that was a small pipe.  I was very calm, looking forward to the high.  This time, I decided, I would find out what it was really like.  It is important to be calm.  Dont do it if you are afraid of being caught.  I suggest doing it in a remote area, such as a campground, or your own home.
431	Anyways, it was the middle of winter, freezing cold (this is Canada).  My friend and I decided to smoke and go tobogganing.  We arrived at the hill, and were there alone.  We went to the bottom of the hill and I smoked all I had.  I should mention that the hill was large, and was actually a hiking path leading down the hill through a forest.  Above us was the steep path, and around that was forest.  At the bottom of the hill there was a lake (frozen) and there was at least one or two feet of snow on the ground.  As I finished off the last of the weed, I suddenly felt like something was trying to push me over.  Not hard, just like a wall of air pushing me softly.  This happened on and off, about three times, for about two minutes (I think).  I finished the weed and stood with my friend, talking about who would go for the next ride.  He had not smoked anything.  Suddenly, I found myself beginning to talk a lot, about nothing.  I was also talking quite loudly, almost shouting.  I remember that I was suddenly not cold, but in fact quite warm.  
432	At this point, mostly everything goes blank.  I remember a number of things, though, that happened throughout the next thirty or so minutes.  I talked a lot.  I laid down in the snow and slammed my head against the ice of a lake (we had been on the bank, and I walked a few feet onto the ice).  There was a lot of snow on it, but I managed to bang through it.  I think I was trying to make snow angels, but Im not sure.  Whatever the case, I didnt feel any pain.  In fact, it was quite fun.  Meanwhile, my friend was riding the toboggan down the hill.  I was shouting at him the whole time, saying really nothing.  I think I had my eyes closed, because I was very warm and I felt like I was sleeping.  At one point, he walked towards me and I jumped up.  His jacket had been rustling and I thought he was my puppy, who tends to rustle as he runs towards you to lick you.  Whatever the case, I explained this to my friend in a very loud voice, so that he would understand.  
433	One important thing to note here is that unless I concentrated, I could not simply say something to my friend.  As soon as I stopped concentrating, everything went blank again, and I fell around some more.
434	Another thing is the fact that I laughed.  I have never laughed so hard in my life.  My friend, laughing at me, laughed a lot too.  I fell all over the place, laughing in a million different ways, very different than my normal way.  A few times, I laughed for long periods of time, harder and harder.  I think the longest period was almost four minutes.  I could hardly breathe by that time.  The laughter is something you must savor.  It is amazing.  You have no reason to laugh, yet you do, hysterically, like a jackal.  I must emphasize that it is very different than normal laughter.  It is phenomenal.  You should have someone video tape you, because you will want to see it again.  You will laugh for the stupidest reasons, probably falling down a lot.  Therefore, I suggest you stand up, because you want to stay excited.  By falling down, you give yourself more to laugh at.
435	At that point, I laid back down (or should I say, fell over).  I then began to talk in every accent I can do, British, Yankee, whatever I could think of.  I remember thinking I had been speaking every language on earth, and I decided to talk to my friend in Chinese.  To me at the time, Chinese was a simple aye-aye-aye-aye.  I did this for a long time, slamming my head into the ice at the same time.
436	Then my friend offered to let me go down the hill.  This, of course, involved me walking up the hill, so I began the long march.  I remember feeling like my voice was a springboard.  This is very hard to describe.  My voice felt very high-pitched, so I was trying to force it down to its normal pitch.  I now know that I thought I was moving through at least fourteen octaves (if you sing you understand that only the best singers can do even eight).  My voice was very high, and as I forced it down, I thought it was becoming more like my normal voice (which is quite low).  But as soon as I stopped trying to hold it down, it shot back up.  I think I was in fact making myself quieter, not lower.
437	Whatever the case, the feeling was euphoric at this point, not really calm.  It took me at least three minutes to get up the hill, which normally would have taken only one or so.  I slipped a lot, since I was wearing Vans on a slope that most people would hesitate to even walk down, let alone ride a toboggan down.  When I got to the top, I then went down, very slowly.  I dragged my feet the whole way, without wanting to, and everything was very blank.  I could hardly see, and felt very mellow by this point.  I think I was beginning to force myself out of my state of mind.  When I got to the bottom, we decided to go.  I do not remember walking back up the hill, but I remember climbing a fence, and walking across a field, and thinking I was going to die of hypothermia, and thinking my friend was going to pass out. 
438	When we got to his house, I was still quite blank, and feeling quite calm and empty.  I ate two massive plates of stir-fry.  Then we watched TV for a while, and then I went home, no longer high.
439	The high is not an ecstasy high.  It does not help you discover yourself, nor does it help you solve problems.  Weed is not something to be used for depression, as after you are done, the effects are gone, completely, other than the memories.  You will not feel like a god, or a better person.  You will simply have laughed a lot.
440	I do not suggest driving, swimming, cycling, or doing anything that could be dangerous, while you are high.  I find I lose a lot of control over my muscles, and can hardly move.  The main effect is the laughter, and the blank feeling.  You feel like you are not in your body, you feel like you are sleeping, dreaming.  It is an amazing feeling.  The whole high, for me, lasted for about one to one and a half hours.  I cant remember exactly.  I think that if I had smoked much more, I would have been completely incapacitated.  As it was, I could hardly move.  I think it is impossible to overdose on marijuana, but you can certainly make yourself throw up a lot, I know.  I dont suggest smoking to the point that you cant think at all.  I have seen people who, when high, cant walk, and crawl instead.  A friend of mine crawled about three miles.  It took him a number of hours.  He doesnt remember any of it.
441	All in all, I suggest bringing a friend with you, who will not be high when you are.  Smoke enough to get you to the point that you feel comfortable.  Dont do enough to go fucking potty.  I recommend marijuana to all of you, before anything else.  Before you can walk, you must crawl.  Before you try E, acid, K, or anything else, try weed.  Its fun, quite safe, and cheap.  I rate it A+.

444	Once upon a merry little time, I was feeling rather sick.  I decided the best medicine would be some high quality grass.  So I called my friends over.  We rolled two decent sized joints and smoked them between the two of us.  Being a very inexperienced smoker at the time, I was very fucked up.  When someone tried to talk to me, their voice would echo in my head.  I kept having flashbacks of my childhood, hearing old phrases and seeing old faces.  After about ten minutes, my friends went home.  It was about 10:00 and the shit was just kicking in hard.  I decided to go to bed.  I put on a Floyd concert, turned out the lights and got into bed.  I closed my eyes and immediatelly I was transported to an alien world.  The lights from the t.v. created some of the most amazing closed eye visuals I had ever seen.  Then suddenly my bed lifted off the ground.  I had the desire to open my eyes because it was way too real.  But I kept them shut.  As my bed went soaring through the clouds, I realized that I was not at all sick anymore.  So I continued to enjoy spinning through a spiral vortex of color and thought.
445	Ever since that night, I've tried to get that high.  I've come close, but can never get that fucked up off two fucking joint now matter how strong they are.

447	The day before spring break, a friend and I decided to have a little smoke session over at my apartment. We hadn't smoked in over 24 hours, and no other drugs had been taken. Being a novice smoker at the time, my friend offered to introduce me to the gravity bong. There are several different ways to make a gravity bong, but we chose to use a 2-liter soda bottle with the bottom 1/4 cut off. 
448	Preparation included filling the kitchen sink with water, and cutting/burning a hole in the bottle cap so as to insert the bowl on top of it. These activites took longer than anticipated, so we smoked a bowl using a regular pipe as we waited. When everything was ready, we inserted the packed bowl into the bottle cap hole, heated it with a lighter to seal it, and set up the bottle in the sink, w/the cap on top. 
449	After a few hits, I had the rythm and technique down for obtaining extremely large hits. This continued for quite a while, and the bowl seemed to last forever. My friend was able to fill the chamber so full that both of us could get an enormous hit off one pull.
450	By the end of the second bowl, I felt somewhat tired. The kitchen seemed so strange as a surrounding, and the light intensity seemed different from normal. My arms and legs were too heavy to move, and I put my head down. The conversation with my friend stopped, and I sat with my head down for a long time. During that time, I was able to see scenes of mixed colors and shapes, that appeared almost as if I had made them appear. 
451	After a while I got up and my friend left. I went to my bedroom, and stared at a car poster with glowing headlights--this intrigued me for at least 5 minutes, and I was able to see things in the glowing headlights. Then I closed my eyes and saw shapes and colors again, except I could control them and make them do what I wanted.
452	This experience, different from my normal high, seemed to last hours, but when I 'woke up,' I called my friend and told him, and he said it had only been a few minutes since he had left. I haven't felt anything like that since then, but the effect sparked my interest in 'tripping substances.'

455	Upon arrival in Canada from Scotland, I was soon invited to try some lovely B.C weed going by the name of White Widow. The stuff was covered in sticky, white THC chrystals and was like nothing I had ever seen before. Having only smoked low-stength resin back home, I was well up for it as were my buddies. The smell was very pungent but very nice. 
456	As soon as we lit up, we could feel the good times roll. After a few strong puffs, we were all absolutely f**ked. My English friend thought he was an explorer and started to swim accross the front lawn. Needless to say, the hilarity sent us into huge fits of uncontrollable laughter. Then, when it eventually subsided a little, I honestly started to believe I was a monkey. I sped around the room like monkeys do making the kind of noises monkeys do. We thought it was hilarious although one of my friends wasn't quite so impressed when I ate all the bananas out his cupboard but hey, I had the serious munchies.
457	After we all calmed down, we got down to some serious munching accompanied by some quality music. The visuals and sonics were amazing. Trip Hop was invented for this drug.
458	I don't know if we were smoking extra strong stuff or it was just because we were new to strong weed but this has to be the single best drug experience if my life.

461	My friend and I had made our way over to a record shop to see a few local bands and stumbled upon a friend whom offered to sell us some weed. Being quite glad we ran into him we purchased a 15 sac and made our way over to the concert. 
462	After arriving there and staying for about an hour we decided to go smoke up with a few friends whom we conveniently ran into. We arrived at his garage and had a beer. Than he pulled out a bowl and a half ounce and started passing it around.  We left after what seemed like 30 minutes. 
463	We arrived at my friends house and smoked some of our 15 sac. Then found ourselves in his brothers bedroom listening to Ministry. I was wearing my SFX contact lenses which made my eyes red and yellow. I started mouthing the words to the song and air guitaring to it. My friend started cracking up and saying my eyes looked like they were on fire. He said he thought I was Satan and started geeking out a little bit, so  I decided to stop. Than started poking at his eyes but not really touching them. He grabbed his eyes and started moaning like I had really poked him. He said it felt like his pupils were going into the back of his head and down into his throat. I started cracking up but at the same time a sense of fear had come over me. So I tried to take control and decided that we go downstairs and eat something. We walked into the kitchen and he puked into the sink and repeated trying to puke when there was nothing left.
464	I was trying to control my laughter considering the fact that I was scared out of my mind. Yet I still managed to try to calm him down and myself as well. By now I realized we had to be tripping some sort of way. We had gone back to his brothers room and started watching TV. He had gone to bed because his head was spinning and he couldn't take it. I was overcome with fear of my friend getting this weird idea in his head and coming into the room and murdering me, so I locked the door. Than I heard a voice in the back of my head telling me to go do what I just thought. I was staring at a sharpened pencil laying on the ground than geeked out and threw the covers over my head. I squeezed my eyes shut in hopes to fall asleep.
465	I woke up a few minutes later to find myself in the same state. I went downstairs to get something to eat. Somehow I managed to cook eggs and wrap them up in a burrito with cheese. I sat down to eat it and kept on seeing someone in the doorway out of the corner of my eye. I just ignored it. After taking a few bites the burrito started to taste real bad. I looked at it and the eggs were all liquidy and looked like some sort of mush. I spit it out on the plate and threw it away. Than ran up stairs into the same room, locked the door, and forced myself asleep.
