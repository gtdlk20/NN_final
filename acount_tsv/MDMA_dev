1	3	a	+2:30. The next hour was spent trying to decide on and get to our next destination, eventually deciding to go to Draper, a city which had a really nice view of the Salt Lake Valley and many places to park. We eventually stopped at a church parking lot, and once parked her second period of memory recall began.
2	3	a	+3:25. On the way up to Draper, she discussed how her ex's mother was in a similar situation as her, currently going through a divorce and living with family there. She mentioned that her ex's dad had been abusive, and while mentioning in passing that her ex had also been abusive (a fact I did not know at the time), she chose to pick up where she left off. Her ex, Jeff, won a half million dollar lawsuit in high school, and as a result both his house and his car were fully paid off.
3	3	a	+3:45. She began discussing her alcohol problems, which she went to rehab for and eventually overcame, but that were very damaging to their relationship. By the time she had become pregnant, she had quit all drugs except marijuana and was loyal to him, never cheating or even talking to guy friends during this time. Her ex seemed to be ignorant of the fact she had changed so much for him, and didn't believe any of the changes would last after the child was born.
4	3	a	+4:15. The discussion then turned towards the abuse, and I was really proud of the fact she was telling me about this with the same straight face and calm features as her first memory recall. Physically assaulted several times, she eventually came to realize that it was a bad environment for their child and 3 weeks prior to Halloween moved out.
5	3	a	+4:25. Once again, she snapped out of the memory and began to make new connections. It was also at this time that the major decision she had set out to decide, what to do about her ex and whether to keep their child, began to form itself. She came to realize that whatever was good about their relationship early on was now gone, and they would never again be like they were then.
6	3	a	+4:30. We began driving back down towards another nearby city, Bluffdale, where we wanted to try and rest a bit since it was almost sunrise and she'd said she was sleeping at a friend's house. Discussing her revelation that things were over, I was convinced she had hit a turning point, and that the therapy had shown her which path to take: putting her ex in the past and moving on.
7	3	a	+4:50. We didn't sleep once we got parked in Bluffdale, though we did watch a news special from a few years back, Ecstasy Rising, that led to us discussing her views on the therapy. As Holly described it, this was like no ecstasy experience she had ever had, and she was amazed at how easy it was to look back at these memories without feeling the pain she usually felt even thinking about him.
8	3	a	+6:20. After talking and watching Ecstasy Rising, we left Bluffdale and I went to take her home. Over 6 hours had elapsed since taking the MDMA and I felt we had made a lot of progress this night, but she wanted to drop by and say hi to my parents first so we headed to my parent's house.
9	3	a	+6:40. Shortly before getting to my parent's home, her 3rd memory recall episode occurred, but due to the drug mostly having worn off she wasn't as prepared to handle it. Beginning to cry, she began asking why he abused her, how could anyone claim to love you when you beg them not to physically hurt you as they ignore your pleas and assault you so badly you fear for your life? We arrived at my parent's house and I was able to explain to her how this memory just reinforced the fact things would never be the same. If she went back, he would just beat her again, it would never stop, and this memory came to solidify her conviction to put whatever love she had for him in the past.
10	3	a	+7:00. While I hadn't taken it into consideration, seeing my family at this point was one of the best things that could occur to help her sort through the events and memories we discussed that night. My mother and stepfather are both very friendly people, and as my stepdad let me in he recognized Holly from years ago, giving her a hug and telling her how great it was to see her again. That he remembered her after only seeing her once over 2 years before caught her off-guard, and I could tell she was touched by this as well as the hug. My mother then arrived and welcomed us in, offering Holly a drink and a seat by the fireplace, then asked what we were doing out there at 8 am. Choosing to tell part of the truth, we told her about our adventures through the canyon, getting lost and ending up in Heber. Amused, she teased us about the fact neither of us ever sleep at night. My mother and Holly got along really well, and talked about gardening and eventually she told my mother she had a daughter. This also proved to be an unintentionally good choice, for my mother was a single parent of 3 during most of my childhood. They began discussing the difficulties of being a single parent, but as my mother made clear it was well worth the effort. My mom essentially picked up where I left off, telling her nearly the same things in response to the abuse he had inflicted and suggesting she gain full custody then raise her baby as a single mother. 
11	3	a	+8:45. We left my parent's home after nearly 2 hours, with Holly arriving home around the same time as they live within a mile of each other. She thanked me for the night, we hugged then she went inside to get some sleep. I found it interesting to note that, even though it had been over 8 hours since taking the capsule, I still felt the euphoric, peaceful effects of the MDMA quite strongly.
12	3	a	She and I talked the next day, and she told me once again that she felt like this experience was unlike anything she'd had before. To quote her exactly, 'I have been in therapy for 8 months, and I feel like last night did more for me than all 8 months of therapy did'. Over the next few weeks I noticed a definite change in her attitude toward life. Unfortunately, a month later she lost her job and the father of her baby was suing for full custody and planning to move out of state. She fell hard into using opiates, and was eventually admitted to rehab for heroin addiction. She's now gotten her life back together, and has joint custody with her ex, who never moved. Due to all the issues that erupted shortly after this therapy session, she has asked me to do another one, which we plan to do in the next few weeks, to help reinforce our first session.
13	3	a	While this experience report is told mostly as my own observation of another's experience, I chose to submit it because I feel this experience shows the benefits of MDMA psychotherapy, and as I took the same dose as her, this is a story about an experience we shared on MDMA. Holly reviewed this report and told me not to change a word, and specifically asked I post this experience report so people could learn the benefits of MDMA psychotherapy from her experience.

15	3	a	MDMA (3) : General (1), Second Hand Report (42), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Small Group (2-9) (17)
16	3	a	Not too long ago my sister and I attended a big event (a rave, if you will) in Los Angeles. We picked up the pills (two blue Mercedes) at a hotel about a mile away. I already had one molly (pure mdma powder) and a pink gun. The rave started at 7:00pm, and my sister and I decided to start walking there around 5:15 to get in line since it was such a big event. As we were walking, we already saw plenty of ravers walking there too, wearing the big baggy pants, beads, and giving light shows while walking down Figueroa. We finally arrive, and we saw much less people standing in line than expected. Id say there were about 200 people in front of us, give or take. So I thought to myself, Sweet, well get in super early. So we patiently waited in line, smoking cigarettes, while people watching.
17	3	a	These events are all about freely expressing yourself, so you see a wide range of people. You mostly see the kandi kids, who wear tons of kandi (beads) and suck on pacifiers; however, anything you could possibly imagine youll see. As were standing there a group of people came and stood behind us. A tall girl with blond 80s rock hair came and she stood out for some reason. My sister and I were standing, minding our own business, and I hear a flamboyant gay guy talking behind us, so I turn around to find out it was the tall blond girl we had seen. Also while standing in line I noticed a guy wearing a tutu, he was obviously rolling (it was easy to tell); all of a sudden he started running and I noticed another guy wearing a tutu. They run up to each other from opposite directions, jump up, and hug each other. It was quite a site to see, but we just looked at each other, shrugged, and minded our own business.
18	3	a	Now its about 6:30pm and Im wondering why they were letting people in yet, since the event started at 7pm, and the opening act from was supposed to be amazing. A homeless black guy was pushing through the crowd saying Hash and Opium, trying to make a quick buck off some gullible e-tard. Everyones smoking cigarettes, some weed. The predominant age group of everyone I say was about 17-20, a lot of younger than one might expect. The line has barely moved. Some people are rolling. This one girl was walking up and talking to random people, while feeling herself and having involuntary jaw movements/teeth grinding (total signs of being on ecstasy). She even came up to my sister and complimented her hair, which is ironic because my sister was complaining about how bad her hair looked the whole day. Another guy was standing close to us, stomping his feet and chewing his gum fiercely. We could hear the rushing bass on the other side of fence and eagerly wanted to get through the gates.  
19	3	a	At this point more and more people are starting to roll, while in line, and so people start giving light shows. For some reason, these two small Mexican girls dressed as princesses really caught my eye. They were both wearing tutus and tiaras, and every once in a while Id make contact with them but theyd look away really quickly. I couldnt tell if they were rolling or not. At this point the line keeps growing and people are starting to get angry, including me. I was sick of being stuck in a crowd of bunch of annoying drug addicts, where I literally couldnt even move my arms. I honestly wanted to leave at one point.
20	3	a	Eventually its about 9pm, and I think Ill be inside the gates within in hour so I decided to take my first pill, the molly. I knew it was cut with pixie stick (yes, the sugary candy) so I figured I would be fine, given that Id feel anything at all. For the next hour Im waiting to feel something, asking my sister repeatedly if my eyes had dilated at all. Its just a little before 10pm, were still in line and I start to feel a little different. I give my 33 year-old sister a big smile for no apparent reason. My sense of touch has changed. Being stuck between all these people is no longer annoying, but actually somewhat pleasant and comforting. I ask my sister, Are my eyes dilated? She replies, Ohhhhh yeahhh. Im rollin.
21	3	a	I ask her to massage my neck, and the harder she massaged the further the eyes would roll to the back of my headthats how good it felt. I closed my eyes while she was doing it and I felt like I was in a completely different world, it was like nothing Ive ever experienced. It felt amazing. I told her, I feel like Im a little kid again. And this Hispanic guy right next to us wearing a bandana over his mouth and those creepy looking contacts (the cat ones) looks at me and just nods his head, knowing exactly what Im talking about. I feel great and probably peaking at this point, but its killed because we still havent even gotten into the rave yet!
22	3	a	Finally I get checked by a security guard wearing a yellow jacket, he says to go on through. Next thing I know I see two other people standing in front of me wearing yellow jackets, one this short, stubby black female. I thought they were more security guards so I was extremely confused, and peaking, and tripping out. Im just standing there rolling balls, not having a clue what to do. Ummm, your ticket? says the short black lady, followed by a loud burst of laughter only black women are capable of. I smile and think to myself Oh god, Im pretty fucked up right now. I give her the ticket, and catch up with my sister and we walk down this passage between to chain-linked fences. We were finally here.
23	3	a	The first thing my sister and I do is light a menthol cigarette and look around. Such a crazy atmosphere. Walking through the entrance was like stepping into a whole new world, especially from standing in line right outside for 5 hours. Everyone you see is on ecstasy, or whatever preferred substance, but most likely ecstasy. I see people dancing intensely, horribly in fact, but no one cares. People are just feeling the music and dancing freely by themselves. Other people are sitting on the ground getting light shows, some massaging each other, some just totally zoned out. The music at this point is sounding so intense and amazing I cant but help but put my arms up and literally just feel the music. I look around, everyone is smiling. Some people, random strangers, stop and say hi before walking to whatever their destination may be. Theres no hate. Everyone is respectful of everyone else, no matter how crazy he or she might be perceived in the real world. The energy and atmosphere I feel at raves like this is something Ive never experienced anywhere else and doubt I ever will.
24	3	a	At this point I need to hit the bathroom and get some water. So my sister and I enter the arena which is swarming with drugged up kids. We head to the concession stand which I expected to be packed, but there were only one or two people in front of us. We get two waters. Then I go to the bathroom while my sister waits and then vice versa. While shes using the restroom and Im holding the drinks, I decide to sit against the wall, which felt pretty cozy. As Im waiting there a boy comes up to me and asks, Want a lightshow? I, still rollin' hard, get all excited like a 5 year-old on Christmas, my eyes light up, and I say yeah! like a little kid. The lights looked like nothing you can ever imagine unless youve experienced a lightshow on ecstasy yourself. You literally become in a trance. Im just sitting there looking all googly-eyed, looking like a complete retard to the hundreds of people walking by, but I didnt care. Eventually he said Alright man, Im getting tired. I immediately say Thank you like I mean it and smile, shake his hand, and he walks away not knowing (actually, Im sure he does) what a crazy state he just put me in for that minute or two.
25	3	a	My sister finally makes it back and we finally walk up the steps into the arena where the main dj was spinning the whole night. My sister, who wasnt on anything at this point, let out a fuck yeah! once we got to the top of the steps. The lights and lasers and music was almost overwhelming  it was all so beautiful. Tons of people are up and dancing in the stands, some just sitting, looking dazed, probably coming down. People are getting light shows. People are giving light shows. People are massaging each other. People are hugging, smiling, just having the best time of their lives. I felt so at home with these thousands of strangers. The vibe was such a positive one and thats what I loved so much and wish I could feel in everyday life. My sister and I find a good seat where we can see everything, and I give her the pink gun pill and she pops it. Out of the blue these two girls sitting behind us put one of those electric hand massagers on my head and shoulders, and at this point, the colored lights lights, the music, the positive vibes and people...this is ecstasy. This is where the name came from. This is the experience people are looking for. Youre happy, everyone around you is happy. Not a worry in the world. What could possibly be better?
26	3	a	After the amazing massage I ask the girl what her name was and she said Bear. I said What? just to make sure I heard it right. Bear. Like the animal.  Oh cool!  What about yours?! My names Apollo. Nice to meet you! Isnt this awesome!!!  Then we turn around and dance some more, get more amazing massages from them. Then I ask them if they want to trade kandi. You trade kandi my holding each others hand, and then sliding your bracelet onto their arm while youre holding hands.  She replied with excitement, Yeah! Let me find a good one!  She digs through the endless number of bracelets on her arms and says Heres one with a star, because youre a star! *smiles*  And then I say This is my sisters first rave! and she looks for another piece of kandi and says to my sister Heres one with a bear claw, that way youll always remember me. Smiles everywhere. I get a text from my friends cousin who took me to my first rave...he wants to hang out. So I turn around, say It was so great meeting you guys! Have a great night! Gave them a hug. And went on our way. It felt as if we all had just instantly bonded on such a deep, profound level. As Im writing this it still blows my mind how connected this drug made me feel to these complete strangers.
27	3	a	Now I go to find Ryan and all of his friends, whom Ive hung out with at the other two raves Ive been to. Theyre a bunch of awesome people. So my sister and I walked up the stairs in the very back of the arena, which had the best view of the lights. I see Brian standing up and waving to me, and I smile and walk past a couple sitting down and give him a hug. Then I say hi to the rest of the group, everyone welcoming and nice as usual. My sister and I sit down, enjoying this new, better view of the lights, the music still sounding heavenly.
28	3	a	Occasionally during the buildup in songs (almost to the climax), thousands of strobe lights would go off, and my eyes would go out of focus and roll to the back of my head. It was such an intense, awesome feeling. During one song I held on to my sister and yelled, Holy shit! I cant handle this! Then I was given countless numbers of light shows, all of which were absolutely amazing. Ryans friend Timmy gave me a lightshow with an orbit and I was in a total trance, in a total world. My eyes just focus completely on the lights (then blur out), the feel of the bass rushing through my veins, and the high pitch of the synthesizers flowing so smoothly. It was indescribable. Ryan was sitting next to me looking at me get the light show, though I was so in a trance I didnt know he was there and until Timmy said holy shit, this guys already fucked up! and then Ryan yelled thats called over-stimulation!!! Nevertheless, it was all amazing. Timmy or Ryan, I honestly dont remember which gave me an incredible neck and head massage where he would rotate my whole head and then do lots of meticulous things with his fingers that I could feel in detail. It felt like I was visiting a chiropractor. Every touch felt so precise, not to mention, so damn good.
29	3	a	Unfortunately I didnt enjoy the massage as much as I possibly could have because at the time I was trying to coordinate meeting up with a friend I had made online named...Gloworm. Yes, thats all I knew her by. It took a while but finally in the concession stand area I see her turquoise sweatshirt and we immediately hug each other and smile and say how nice it was to finally meet, and continue hugging. She introduces me to her friends, one of which was sucking on an ornately decorated pacifier, the other guy chatting non-stop. Theyre names were Brunho and Hack, respectively. Hack, a black gay guy probably around 20 years old, shook my head and ask me to squeeze his nipples really hard. He lifts his shirt, and as requested, I squeeze his nipples. Harder, he says, and I follow, just laughing and frying away. Gloworm keeps looking at me, saying Youre so cute, and continues hugging me. Then her friends were ready to be on their way and they start to leave, and she just keeps hugging and says Wait to her friends. We continue hugging, which felt so comforting, we look at each other and kiss on the lips for a few seconds, which also felt great. We then trade our kandi that we made specifically for each other. I show her the one I made her before I slide it onto her arm and she looks at me in the eyes and goes awww.  Then eventually her friends convince her to leave she apologizes for having to go so soon. We kiss again and then we each go on our own separate ways, happy as can be for finally having had the opportunity to meet.
30	3	a	The rest of the night I hung out with my sister and Ryans group again, doing the same as wed been doing all night. I remember looking at my phone and realizing everything was about to end in 15 minutes and told my sister, I dont want this to end! and she replied They should just keep it goin. Finally it was over. No more flashy lights. No more intense music. The arena we were in was once again just that. We left and I was still happy and feeling the drug, but it was definitely slowly dissipating. It didnt help that almost everyone else was pretty much down at this point. We walked back to the hotel at 4am. We head up to Ryans room where my sister and I use the restroom and then head to our car. At this point Im coming down and feel extremely physical tired, but my brain...the best way to describe it is, it felt like there was a storm in my brain. Just like 1314230423 things going on at once. At this point I realize Ive been on a drug for the past few hours! We then attempted to drive to my brothers apartment in Orange County. My sister, who was no longer under the influence was driving. She kept smoking cigarettes in the car, and that made me feel nauseous, even though Id been smoking a lot throughout the night. Then she turned up some trance on her radio real loud and I just had to turn it down cuz it made my head throb with pain. I got this super horrible headache right smack in the center of my forehead. I had this weird feeling like taking 3 that night might have been too much, but then I told myself that I just needed to go to bed. It was all in my mind. We finally arrive to my brothers place and I immediately hop in bed and try to sleep, even though my head was still ringing. Coming down on e is when you realize, Damn, this is a DRUG. It aint pot or alcohol. My brain felt used.
31	3	a	The next day I was extremely tired and just wanted to lie in bed all day. Occasionally I would get another headache in the center of my head. Unlike the previous times Ive taken ecstasy, the worst days were 3 to 4 days later. I just felt super depressed, and it wasnt one of those feelings you could just snap out of. I also had a short fuse and would get angry at things pretty quickly. Its been a week now and Im finally feeling normal and happy again. But the comedown and after of this experience were by far the worst Ive had.
32	3	a	Was it worth it? Yes. Each time Ive taken ecstasy at a rave setting its really been an amazing experience thats taught me a lot. When Im on it and at a rave I feel so connected to people and I just love how everyone is nice to each other and theres no judging  you just feel like you can be yourself without any restrictions. And youre just so optimistic about everything. Everything about it  the music, the lights, the people, the shift in perspective  are all worth the holes in the brain, in my opinion. Its an experience that youll never understand unless youve done it, and I know that lots of people are gonna judge me because its a drug, but I dont care. Its not like Im doing it every weekend, and in my opinion the experiences are worth it. If only everyone could be as nice to people as they are on ecstasy as they are in real life. I guess thats the depressing thing once the drug is over. You realize youve been living in an ideal world for the past few hours, and now youre back to this.

34	3	a	MDMA (3) : General (1), Glowing Experiences (4), Rave / Dance Event (18)
35	3	a	E is definitely a drug that brings out the true emotions a person has inside of them. It has made me really bond with some people. But other times I have regretted using it.
36	3	a	One of the first times doing E was with a person I was already interested in. The rave that night was incredible and I spent the entire time with that one person, just bonding with her. And I really felt a true sense of pure happiness. But things didn't work out as planned as I was leaving for a long getaway. That night had been one of the most enjoyeable of my life, and the feeling had been mutual. I ended up leaving, planning to stay away from home for a year. The whole time away from this person I had ended missing them so much I decided to come back after only three months.
37	3	a	We both were not sure of how we wanted things to be when I came back. But we agreed to see each other still. I really looked forward to the next time I would be able to drop E with her again, but the anticipation turned out to be the only thing I enjoyed that night.
38	3	a	When we kissed on E our very first time the feelings were so intense, but the night of this rave our kiss was not even close to that. I wasn't even turned on by her anymore. I couldn't believe that such intense feelings could disappear just like that!
39	3	a	But if I couldn't even enjoy it on E then I realized that this was not going to work with her, and I know she felt the same way about things. I thank the E for really waking me up, instead of faking my emotions and lying everytime I tell her I care about her.

41	3	a	MDMA (3) : Rave / Dance Event (18), Relationships (44), General (1)
42	3	a	The only reason I take E is for spiritual expansion of my own consciousness. It has allowed me to be my true self more completely. I am less inhibited, yet it doesn't make me do anything I would not want to do, it just helps me get in touch with the inner wellspring of courage that I so often do not realize is there.
43	3	a	Ecstasy has also ignited major spiritual growth in my life. I have experienced kundalini energy rise up my spine while dancing at raves, although the biggest lesson I learned from E is that I should take more risks, because 9 times out of 10, I will be successful. Magical things happen for months after a successful trip.

46	3	a	[Most of the text below is also a part of the longer version of this account]
47	3	a	The best that I ever felt on ecstasy was something that was not quite happiness nor euphoria, but rather a profound and perfect sense of unity of mind, body, spirit and soul; and I understood in an instant exactly what happiness and being happy involved; and at the same time I was overwhelmed by a hope that I would someday get there.
48	3	a	I realised that I was looking for something that few people understand or achieve; something that I understand but haven't achieved and cannot articulate. I am searching for a state of being in which mind, body, spirit and soul are fundamentally indivisible yet each feeds the understanding of the other - a feeling that all the words in the world can only understate.
49	3	a	That night I almost found it. Someday I think I might. It is not something I will find alone, but rather by a dynamic combination of factors which have to be in the right place at the right time. I don't see ecstasy as escapism but rather it helps me on my journey, shows me the direction, or perhaps it helps me to see that direction, and
50	3	a	I personally don't believe I would have ever reached that point without the use of a psychoactive drug; which is why the 'I don't need drugs to have a good time' attitude is rather puzzling to me. I suppose the question is does it matter anyway, some people get on perfectly without either the use of drugs or reaching that state; my answer would be yes, it does matter a lot, or I wouldn't look for it, and having been made aware for the existence of such a state I don't think I will ever stop looking.
51	3	a	I've been trying to understand for a long time the antipathy towards the usage of chemicals for purposes other than the purely medicinal. And failed, really.

54	3	a	This is a query regarding the effects of ecstacy on a person with epilepsy. I have done some searching in books and on the web, but am yet to find much information on the subject. (I did notice it was mentioned in your book)
55	3	a	The reason I am writing to you is that everything I have read says that ecstacy and epilepsy do not mix and it is not something that I should try. Being young and inquisitive I decided to find out for myself, and in a very safe environment I have tried a couple of Es. From my experience the short term outcome was that I had no seizures on any of these occasions and for several days afterwards. This is from someone who rarely goes a day without a seizure. (I have temporal lobal epilepsy, involving complex partial seizures)
56	3	a	I acknowledge that I am taking a risk in relation to long term affects, but with such a new drug I think we all are. (It is no more of a risk than the prescription drugs I have to take that are no more than 5 years old.)
57	3	a	I do not expect you to have an answer to this question, but would be interested if you had heard of other specific incidences of epilepsy and ecstacy or know of where I may be able to find specific research. I also thought you may be interested in this experience for your own research etc.
58	3	a	As an aside I have approval from my neurologist to smoke marijuana to aid with my seizures. It is something that I noticed improved things for me, and I followed this up with similar searches in books and on the net to find that this was not an uncommon experience.

60	3	a	This account is my observation of my sister on MDMA.  I was unable to take the MDMA because I am on SSRI's, so I got a pretty sober description.
61	3	a	Effects did not kick in until about 2.5 hours, we now regret our timing with when she took the pill. 
62	3	a	While on MDMA, subject was speaking in drawn out questions and also cared about MY experience:'Is everything OKaaaaaay? Where are you goinnnnnggg?' --and this was in response to me getting up to use the bathroom. Maybe this suggests some anxiety on her part, but I couldn't help but think I had some fault in this because I didn't know how to react to someone rolling and if I should laugh or actually help her understand.  Now I wish I did the latter. 
63	3	a	I tried to offer support like giving her a massage, thinking positive thoughts, helping her in decision making, because that seemed to be very difficult for her, but she was easily convinced once I suggested something more authoritatively.  (Come on, just try to eat this.) 
64	3	a	Did not sleep very well, maybe 4-5 hours of interrupted sleep.  Now is trying to sleep again with a pounding headache, feelings of needing to throw up.  Adersion to loud sounds, photophobia, and is being negative 'I had to study today, I feel horrible'.
65	3	a	Gave her ibuprofen, vitamin C, and Geritol (Multivitamin), and black salt pill called Hajmola (she likes taking those they are for digestion and it is the only thing she feels like eating)

67	3	a	MDMA (3) : Guides / Sitters (39), Second Hand Report (42), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
68	3	a	I had used MDMA 10-20 times before, and had realized that the effects of the drug were beginning to be milder each time.  After this i stopped taking the drug for the rest of my time in high school.  I also read an entry online that stated that MDMA use is no different if your second time doing it was a week or 10 years after your first use.  After reading this I took a break from taking it until a couple of friends were going to Atlanta Ga for New Years Eve.  I was looking forward to taking 'molly' or MDMA powder at the concert for NYE.  It had been more than six months since my last adventure with MDMA, and I was looking forward to seeing if the effects would be the same if not better than my first time use.
69	3	a	I took .2 grams of 'molly' that day and not as much as 5 minutes later was feeling the euphoric feeleings.  After this I did not look back.  I had no thoughts of the journal entry I had read online months before, but instead just thought about what a good time I was having at this concert.  My 'come down,' as many would call it, was not harsh by any means. I also realized that I had peaked for the entire concert.
70	3	a	This to me was ensuring evidence that my mind is the main factor of my 'trip.'  My conclusion to this story is that MDMA has no 'loosing the magic' to it, but instead I myself lose the magic.  This is my opinion.

72	3	a	MDMA (3) : General (1), Retrospective / Summary (11), Addiction & Habituation (10), Glowing Experiences (4), Loss of Magic (34), Festival / Lg. Crowd (24)
73	3	a	Having a number of experiences with MDMA, I can say that I'm comfortable and informed about everything I experience, and certainly research beforehand for safety purposes.  A friend of mine told me he had some Pink Playboy pills.  Again, Ive tried many different forms of MDMA (including Mollys), but I had yet to experience these.  From what he told me they were great.  I got to his house and despite the fact that I trust him fully and that he was himself at the time rolling, I proceeded to do some quick internet research to ensure I didnt take too many and have health issues.   [Erowid Note: 
74	3	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  Any music I had on my iPod was like heaven to me.  I found myself singing to just about everything without a care in the world.  
75	3	a	I met my lady friends at the Jacuzzi and we hung out for about an hour and a half.  They had no idea I was rolling because I figured they might trip out about that.  Forewarning about hot water immersion on MDMA, as your body temperature is already higher than normal (or sometimes colder, for that matter), its extremely important to not stay fully immersed for too long.  Keep hydrated, etc. etc.  Anyways, the Jacuzzi was absolutely amazing.  I loved the feeling of the skin of the water on my palms.  Not to mention, dunking my head shortly was like a different world of feelings.  Underwater, I felt like I was floating (more-so than usual) and every part of my body tingled with pleasure.  I wanted to kiss one of the girls (or both haha) more than anything, but they are too good of friends.  I also wanted to be upfront with them of my mindset, but again, I didnt know how theyd react.  Plus, I want to share everything with everyone when I'm rolling so I had to tell myself to forget about sharing and talk with them.  This proved to be the right decision, and I found myself perfectly content with carrying on a conversation with them.  Around 11:30PM, I began to get the normal eye-flutters commonly experiences with MDMA.  The girls finally left and I returned to my house (the pool was in my community, so no more risky driving).  
76	3	a	When I got into my house I was rolling hard.  But not in a bad way, it was great.  I began to get visual effects similar to those while under the influence of mushrooms or LSD.  This was amazing for me because these visuals were unlike any Ive ever seen before with MDMA.  I grabbed a glass of orange juice (to put some vitamin C in my body and to heighten my experience) and decided to feel anything I could find that was soft.  Everything sent tingles up my body and I loved it.  Lucky for me, my SUPER soft cat decided to join me.  Im allergic to cats, but only if I rub my face after petting them.  I proceeded to pet my cat (avoiding any contact with my face).  My cat felt unreal.  It was the most amazing thing Ive ever felt on MDMA next to Kashmir fabric and my authentic rabbit fur Russian hat (which I actually purchased in Russia).  By this time I needed to urinate and headed to the bathroom.  The walls felt amazing, the bumps on the drywalls were definitely taking odd shapes, and they were warping slightly.  I probably spent a good half hour in the bathroom (which is simply a shower and a toilet, very small) looking at what I thought was a whole new world.  I was having such an amazing time I decided to come here and share my experience.  Currently, it is 3:50AM.  I am definitely still feeling plenty of effects, visuals and all.  
77	3	a	For ingesting all my pills by 9PM, Im comfortable saying this is the longest roll Ive ever experienced.  To anyone interested in experimenting with MDMA for the first time, be smart.  Know who youre getting it from, very well.  Research the exact pills (color, size, shape, and logo) to get an idea of how much to safely ingest.  Read others experiences with the same pills, if possible.  Dont be too active, and if you do, make sure to take a break periodically as your heart rate is generally increased to begin with.  Drink plenty of water over time (but dont over hydrate).  For better effects, drink some orange juice, but not too much as this can cause vomiting.  Experience it with your friends, never alone.  Essentially, be smart, be safe, and have fun.  Trying to outdo yourself, prove yourself to friends, or just plain being an idiot can and more than likely WILL reap serious consequences.  In the end (or technically not the end since Im still feeling effects), Ive had a great time.  I hope this is helpful to anybody who reads this.  Dont get the wrong impression about this article either.  This is not to entertain; it is for informational purposes and is intended to help/answer questions some may have.

79	3	a	Sometimes I just don't get it...  How can the government make such beautiful things illegal, it makes me want to scream.
80	3	a	Anywho, it was time for my friend J's last rave with us in the Arizona crew as he made his way to Cali.  We took a quick drive to [an event].  I had planned to take X again, so that was the first thing I was looking for.  Security confiscated my shopping bag of water, but let me keep my smokes. I got into the door and met up with M, K, Dee, Beezle, Bi, Hows, J, and Hed.  Hows got the X for us, it was two for $12, 'double stack' Blue Crosses.  I took two and so did nearly everyone else with the exception of M, K, and Beezle.
81	3	a	I finally hit, I could feel the tingle creeping up my spine, and began to instinctively bob my head to the music.  Five Minutes later I was swamped with it.  It was beautiful, I was covered in vibrating particles of bliss, and felt as if I wasn't even sitting on the floor.  Shortly thereafter I felt the need to burp, and it wouldn't come out.  The longer I couldn't burp the more I felt like my throat was getting closed up.  I gagged...  I realized I was going to puke.  It wasn't in my stomach, (the feeling that is), I just knew it was going to happen.  I stood up walked to the trash, and vomited.  The whole experience wasn't like puking with mushrooms or alcohol, it felt GREAT.  For a few minutes I thought I just puked my buzz away, but it came back.
82	3	a	People who don't go to raves don't understand them, you can tell them, but they won't believe it.  People really are that nice, I was offered water every two minutes, given back massages by completely random people, got lightshows all the time, and returned the favor also.  I enjoy being nice to people.
83	3	a	Things just felt great, even sober I have to say that I would be having a good time there with everyone.  My mouth started to hurt from the gum that I was chewing on.  I followed Bi around for a bit and finally got to know him, it was the first time I met him.  We ended up starting a little love fest in our corner of the room, and I laid for most of the next two hours kissing random women and girls, and writhing together on the floor.  Even though I was highly aroused, I just didn't get an erection.  I had only wanted one for a short while, but my attention span was pretty small, and I ended up using my mouth.  It was a bad choice that I would have made while sober, but I wasn't sober so it was even more fun for me.  There is something weird about the sensation of being so close to somebody, the smell, the heat on your face, the taste, the skin.  It just seems perfect.  She was a random person, and she was on X too.  When she was thoroughly satisfied, we both ended up giggling and laughing and saying thank you at the same time.  I invented a few new tricks to play on people who are rolling or shrooming that are based on my hypnotism techniques, but inspired and invented while I was rolling.  These only really work if one has the voice and the technique to work it.  I learned about hypnotic voices in books and on the internet.
84	3	a	Sit next to the recipient on the floor (indian style) with your body facing their right side. Gently rest your face on her temple and bring your mouth close to her ear.
85	3	a	Take their hand, and put your fingers between theirs, grasp loosely and lightly.
86	3	a	Me:' Now close your eyes and imagine.  You can see the outline of the room now, and the outlines of people become clear.  In the room there is a hazy light yellow mist, that vibrates with a pure beautiful energy.  It is flowing from the people and through the room full of vibrant perfection.  And as we sit together my body begins to pull in the energy like a vacuum.  The more energy my body pulls in the hotter my hand feels.  I pull in more and more of the vibrant energy, and my body begins to glow a bright yellow.  My hand gets extremely hot'
87	3	a	Me: 'And as I grip your hand and get hotter and hotter my hand begins to melt into a thick hot liquid.  My hand coats your skin and it feels as if it is slowly flowing through your skin into your arm.  The hot energy comes with my body and fills up your arm, every vein is hot and filled with a vibrant and beautiful energy.
88	3	a	Slowly blow hot breath from her hand up her arm, one or two times, SLOW AND HOT.
89	3	a	Your body is now filled with a beautiful and vibrant energy, and your arms and skin vibrate with and intense energy.  It is so beautiful and perfect.'
90	3	a	Blow on her face and neck with your nose, and then kiss her hand and let go.
91	3	a	It is taking me a little bit to finish this one, but I find that to be good.  Only because yesterday I felt pretty bummed, perhaps it was the X or maybe just J leaving.  Either way I felt sad.
92	3	a	I love X, I have to admit it, I won't stop.  But in reality, X alone loses some of the special value that it has at a rave.  The whole atmosphere, the kindness, the music, the dancing and the fun.  That is what I want, I wish I could have that feeling forever.
93	3	a	Now, only memories are left of the great time that I had.

95	3	a	MDMA (3) : Loss of Magic (34), General (1), Rave / Dance Event (18)
96	3	a	The length, intensity, control and power of my first MDMA trip is without comparison.  I had previously tried marijuana and smokeable DMT and subsequently I have tried psilocybin and Ayhuaska.  My Shaman informs me that he knows only one other person who has had an experience like mine and I would like to hear from other people who have.  I can only describe some of my trip here so I will talk to you about my ring and mirror, my psychic abilities, my increased physical strength and some proofs in religion.  I will keep my relationship with the Hindu Goddess Kali private! Remember that this entire trip lasted for an astonishing seven hours, not bad for a lifetimes worth of experience, but it was exhausting.  
97	3	a	It might be important to note that we had been smoking almost pure purple haze joints with added Shivas resin for an hour before the hallucinations started coming on.  I was strangely depressed just before the effects began, this is why I took an extra dab of powder and the effects took hold soon after. When I started going under I was immediately aware of its power, the start was like the beginning of DMT except that I was compelled to quest for something.  The quest lasted a short amount of time but was very difficult.  When I reached the top of a pillar of rock I found a tiny box on a pedestal, after sighing for it like some bizarre library, I unlocked the box and took out a ring consisting of two concentric gold pieces when I put this on the third finger of my right hand it split and locked on.  The two parts crossed at the sides of the lower knuckle and opened in a way that allowed me to flex my finger.  The flesh in-between the rings was now transparent to me in both the real world and the dream world.  I could use it to read auras and peoples thoughts in the real world. 
98	3	a	In the dream realm I now had absolute control; I could teleport to any place or time by seeing it in the ring and climbing through.  A short time later I stumbled across a very kind hearted shaman (he could make my spirit guide laugh) called Shenan who showed me that my other hand was a mirror that I could use like a telescope to see things smaller or bigger depending on whether I looked through the palm or the back of it respectively.  This is how could see the entire universe (and beyond) past the DNA molecules, down to thought vibrations rippling across atoms.  In the real world I could use it to travel inside peoples memories.
99	3	a	At one point a new friend asked me to read his thoughts and not only could I describe the surroundings of his first house in detail but I reminded him that the patio was where he had first learnt to play chess, he was using black and facing the garden, the checking piece was a white bishop (I didnt even know he played chess before MDMA).   This sounds impressive but my skills were limited only to the past, when trying to see into the future I predicted to my embarrassment that the large Iraqi anti-war march was going to be bombed by pro-war terrorists.  My flat mate didnt go because of me.  For days after the experience I could clearly see other peoples auras - it was particularly easy to read a womens  I had difficulty interpreting the colours meaning and even if I thought I was sure of my judgement I couldnt confirm the results easily. 
100	3	a	When I was certain that I had all the drugs out of my system I returned to jujitsu as usual.  Before I started the warm up I noticed that I could get my wrists to touch my toes when before MDMA I was straining to get my fingers there.  In the warm up I was the only one to be caught out for every press-up penalty in this game that the dojo plays.  At the end the Sempi in charge of the warm up sat on my shoulders to try to wear me out  my strength and fitness had grown considerably.  After the session I realised that I had not eaten all day because of the twelve hours I had spent in the library. 
101	3	a	Although I did not want to test or taint my visions I researched Egyptian and Hindu mythology, obscure eastern European religions and Shamanism.  The connections to some of the things in my vision and also to each other led me to believe that there is an accessible dream world that is very similar between different cultures and individuals.  I did wonder if I had imagined the visions as a strange mixture of ideology from religious education at school, but I hadnt studied any of this in such detail before.  If anyone is interested, Hera from Greece, Hathor from Egypt, Kali from Hindi, and the Neolithic Snake Goddess from Eastern Europe, and my vision loosely share the characteristics of: shape changing, horned snakes, the duality of being a lover and a mother, dog/jackal aspect, wealth, wisdom and war. 
102	3	a	The spill over of powers from the dream world into the real world is the most intriguing experience of my life and as a philosophy student it has positively realigned my perceptions. I am now doing a dissertation based on some of the ideas I took from my trip.   As a final note I would like to express my hope that anyone who reads this has similar experiences on their favourite hallucinogens and to say never underestimate the power of the human brain.

104	3	a	MDMA (3) : Nature / Outdoors (23), Entities / Beings (37), General (1), Alone (16)
105	3	a	I have one pill that was given to me as Ecstasy/MDMA. I had split the pill in half, and swallowed one half with some tap water.
106	3	a	An hour passed and I felt nothing, so I swallowed the other half with some tap water.
107	3	a	A Half hour passes and I still feel nothing. So I undress and lay down in bed and try to go to sleep assuming the pill was bunk.
108	3	a	As I lay in bed I can feel tingling sensation crawling down my back from my shoulders, then a while later I moved my head and it felt incredibly light as if the force of gravity had been reduced. I then noticed the same sensation in my arm and decidied to get out of bed as I may now be feeling the sensation of the drug.
109	3	a	I sat in front of the computer and put on some music with headphones as it was late at night. I didn't notice any auditory distortions, but I felt differently about the music, possibly more emotionally connected.
110	3	a	My limbs feel so easy to move like they had been oiled. I wanted to dance to music but I was so physically relaxed that I found it difficult to hold my body upright.
111	3	a	As the experience intensified I became more physically relaxed to the extent that while sitting in the computer chair I coudln't hold my head upright either, all my limbs were floppy. I ended up laying on the floor with a pillow as I couldn't support my body.
112	3	a	Over all I notice a time dilation through the experience. 
113	3	a	At about 3 hours into the experience I went back to bed and went to sleep quicker than I usually do when sober.
114	3	a	I woke up about 7 hours later after a some of the best sleep I've had in a long time. For the next 2 days I feel totally relaxed as I did during the experience but all other effects of the drug are absent. This relaxation makes it difficult to to concentrate and focus on work.

116	3	a	MDMA (3) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Alone (16)
117	3	a	The purpose of this experiment was to determine if there is cross-tolerance between methylone and MDMA.  The usual dose of 220mg methylone was ingested five days prior to the MDMA experience.  The methylone experience was quite pleasant, with a few new insights and much relaxation.  The MDMA tablets were left over from several years ago from an airtight container, and from previous use, I knew they were good.  I had not consumed any MDMA-related substances (except methylone) for well over a year.
118	3	a	I took 1200mg of Piracetam two hours prior to dosing, but other than that, I had no other drugs in my system.
119	3	a	T+0: I ingested one MDMA pill on an empty stomach.
120	3	a	T+30mins: I experienced very difficult come-up effects, such as being unable to think clearly, slight over-stimulation, racing heart, chills, and fatigue.
121	3	a	T+2hrs: I never really felt like I came up.  However, at least the terrible come-up effects had dissipated by this time.  Euphoria was almost completely absent, and I was surprised how difficult it was to think or keep perspective during the come up phase.
122	3	a	T+4hrs: The last two hours werent bad, but euphoria or feelings of love never developed.  I got some good pondering done, but I felt little physical energy other than my strongly-beating heart.  My eyes were closed almost the entire time.  My pupils were very, very dilated, but I did not experience the softness or sparkle around lights that is usually apparent with MDMA.  This is very unlike what these tablets did over a year ago.  I also did not experience any memory problems, but then again, I don't smoke pot.
123	3	a	Conclusion: Methylone may downregulate the receptors used for the MDMA high, or it may deplete similar neurotransmitters as MDMA.  Five days is not enough recovery time.  Overall, the MDMA experience was not worth it  it was pretty much wasted.  However, the whole point of the experiment was to determine if there was cross-tolerance with methylone, and it appears there is, to quite a large extent!  I hope this information will be passed on to those interested.

125	3	a	My friend and I decided to buy ecstasy one night. We bought two yellow UFO pills. Since it was her first time, she only did half, and I did mine and her other half. At first, we thought they were kife(fakes) because they took so long to kick in. About an hour later, I started to rise, it was like my life was just vivid, and bright. My friend and I were giving each other hand massages, talking about life, philosophy. I felt like she was my best friend, my only friend. But someone else came into the room, someone who was not on E, and I felt the worst vibes from him. It almost scared me. I felt dread in my stomach, and I just asked him to leave. But the bad vibe clung to me. 
126	3	a	Around the 3 hour mark of being high, I started getting really hot and sweaty, and I went outside for a little bit. It had just started snowing, and the sun was rising. The snow was glistening, untouched, and it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. My trip lasted for about six hours, and then I started sketching out really bad. As my trip neared the end, I got a feeling of bitterness wash over me. I didn't want it to end. I had the worst crash, I didn't cry, but my friend did. She was holding her head, asking why she felt so bad, why did it have to end. We went to the coffee shop around the corner, but all I felt was bad vibes, and I just wanted to go home and sleep. I couldn't sleep all day, and I still felt horrible the next day. I was very depressed for a few days, but then I was fine again. I guess those are the up's and down's of doing ecstasy.

128	3	a	MDMA (3) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
129	3	a	Trip Dose and Duration: One pill, chemical analysis of a few of the same pills tested positive for MDA.  
130	3	a	I have used MDMA before three times, though it was three years ago, and I never really saw it for what it is, or even understood it because of my love for traditional psychedelics.  It was quite a change, and I was expecting it to cause a trip, but with more of a feeling of comfort in the body and mind.  I never got any visuals, though I did feel awesome.  It never changed me like Peyote, Psilocybe mushrooms, Morning Glory, LSD, and such has.
131	3	a	Well, I was on Pill Reports reading about a certain pill that plenty of people seemed to think were awesome on Thursday March 25th.  On Friday, I was in Wallmart and I ran into my friend J who said he rolled for the first time last night.  I wasnt too excited, but I asked him how he liked it.  He said he loved it, but I still wasnt interested because of my prior experience with entactogens.  I asked what was on the pill, and he described the exact pill I was reading about on Pill Reports that was around the area where I live.  My girlfriend was with me, and so we decided to give it a try.  I couldnt remember whether the pill was said to contain MDMA or MDA, but everyone said they felt very clean and very strong.  Many said they would never take more than two of the pills.  I proceeded to purchase two of them, and me, my girlfriend A, J, and another friend P went to his house where I was going to make them some Poppy seed tea, as they wanted to try it after I reported a few successful experiences to them.  Ps cousin came down as well.  
132	3	a	Me and A swallowed the pills at exactly 11PM, right before we got back to Ps.  I started making the tea for them, and I explained to them the process of making it in case I started rolling really hard and couldnt pay attention to what I was doing.  After about 20 minutes, I felt a little strangeness, but no euphoria yet.  I walked outside after making two cups of tea, and now Ps cousin wanted to try the tea.  I walked outside off of the porch where A and Ps cousin were sitting, and it was then that I noticed the euphoria coming on.  It was mild, but every wave was getting more intense.  I walked back inside, and P was finishing up his tea, and he commented on how dilated my pupils were, and he said I looked like I was rolling.  As soon as he mentioned the word rolling, that set it off.  A wave of euphoria shot up through me, and my heart started beating faster.  I felt a stimulation that led me outside.  I didnt want to be in a closed in space.  I asked A if she was feeling it yet, and she said she was unsure.  I told her to get up and walk with me into the yard, as I know sitting down can keep you from experiencing some of the effects.  
133	3	a	She started walking, and it hit her.  I started noticing something strange in that I was somewhat antisocial.  I mean, I enjoyed being around others, and I felt the connection, empathy, love, emotion, and everything, but I just wasnt wanting to express it in conversation.  I felt it all within me very strong though.  I sort of wanted to just experience it, and let it flow through me.  I sat with A in my car for a couple minutes, and we hugged and kissed, which felt awesome, but something didnt feel exactly like the Ecstasy I knew a few years ago. 
134	3	a	Once A got back to the seat where she was sitting, I walked out into the yard.  I started to notice that I was preoccupied, looking at the sky and lights, much like I was staring into visions induced by mushrooms.  I closed my eyes, and it seemed as though all of the emotion that was flowing within me was expressing itself in closed eye visuals.  It was as if I was seeing love and passion.  I opened my eyes, and just as well, there were visuals in the sky.  I was amazed, and I walked up to J.  I looked at him and said, this isnt MDMA, its MDA.  Every description of effects Ive ever read about MDA was running through me.  I was rolling so hard that my eyes kept rolling in the back of my head in pure Ecstasy.  As I opened them, my eyes twitched with Nystagmus.  When they twitched, the lights softened as if they were bright fireflies in the midst of a misty summer night.  There was a comforting blurry vision as well as the visuals that softly entered my visual field.  I was, as many people that are into Ecstasy would say, blowing up.  I have never rolled that hard, and I was tripping on top of that.    
135	3	a	I tried to think of what could make the experience better, and the only thing I could think of was Cannabis.  I went downstairs and took three large hits of high grade Cannabis, and I walked back inside.  This intensified the visuals so much that I couldnt concentrate on anything.  I stared off of Ps porch into hallucinogenic space for nearly half an hour.  I felt beyond awesome.  The twitching of my eyes continued and the visuals flickered about.  I was still rolling my eyes in the back of my head, and I was having a true, inner experience.  There was movement about the air and I had what I can only describe as closed-eye movies.  Though there was generally less connection, empathy, and social enhancement than with MDMA, the sheer euphoria was far more intense.  This was what I vaguely pictured MDMA to be like when I first tried it.  With my use of Methylone, I started to realize some of the things that drew me away from these types of entactogens.  There was something feminine that I found about them.  
136	3	a	I came up with alot of theory that I wont get into here, but I found the reasons that I leaned more towards traditional psychedelics, though I did still like the entactogens.  Now I knew why.  MDA lacked most of that feminine aspect as well.  The inner feeling was indescribable.  It wasnt just physical, it was spiritual. 
137	3	a	I started thinking about alot of things that had been bothering me within the past few months.  I started realizing that I was growing a hatred towards different aspects of life itself, and that the hatred was directed at the wrong source.  All the while I should have been hating the true evil of the world, I was blaming our society, government, and culture for many things that were distressing me.  The MDA seemed to point me in the right direction, and help me understand that these underlying evils need to be pointed out, and lived against instead of lashing out against the government and society.  I started thinking about communism, and its bleeding into America.  People dont even realize it.  But with all the realizations, all I could really do is reaffirm my faith in God.  It is the only place I find peace of mind.  I believe the MDA pointed me to it.  
138	3	a	It was 4AM when I got back to As house where I was staying, and I was still rolling a little, and I was definitely still tripping.  I had a swift crash, but I didnt get any negative thoughts or anything.  I just felt physically drained.  I believe I didnt experience a harsh come-down because of the life changing experience I had.  Though I felt very drained the following day, I was filled with new ideas and beliefs about things for a week after.  I have had plenty of life changing experiences on traditional psychedelics, but this was my first for entactogens.  I still favor natural psychedelics, and I always will, but Ive now seen the power that entactogens can offer.  I will say this though, I definitely favor MDA over MDMA.  One of my friends told me of someone that tried MDA back in the day, and said they called it Cub Scouts of America, or Coke, Smack, and Acid because it gave you the strong euphoria and stimulation of Cocaine, but it gave you the intense euphoric body feelings of Heroin, and it made you trip.  Though this is a stretch, I can understand where he got that from.  MDA has a special place in my heart, and I now understand the unique psychedelic effect that entactogens offer.
139	3	a	I went back on Pill Reports and these pills were tested to be MDA.  I also talked to someone that is experienced in chemistry, and they said there was around 100mgs of MDA and no other testible material other than filler in the pills.  The pills were alot thicker than most Ecstasy pills Ive ever seen.

142	3	a	I started taking exstacy with my husband because one of our friends tried it and recommended we try it.  The first time we took it, we were at home with the kids tucked tightly in bed.  We retreated to our family room, turned on some R & B, snuggled on the couch and within 40 minutes, we felt a rush of warmth all over our bodies. We sat up all night long just talking!  We literally didn't walk up the stairs until 7:30 the next morning. Scientifically, when you take X, it releases seratonin in your brain and when it is released for the first time, there is no better feeling in the world!  The first time we took it, we took 1 1/2 pills each.  That was more than enough for our first time.  The next few times we took it, which was within 6 weeks, we took 2 each.  
143	3	a	As we did it more and more (about every 6-8 weeks), we had to take more and more.  The effects weren't as wonderful as the first time though.  Therefore, some people may say it loses its affect the more you take it.  That is what happened to me.  I just couldn't take it anymore.  I had my fun with it and that was it.  I noticed though that after I stopped taking it I had become depressed.  I was even on anti-depressants for 6 months.  It doesn't effect everyone the same way.  My husband still gets that old time feeling every time he takes it.  Though he doesn't take it anymore because I don't.  If we were to do it again, he would feel as though it were the first time.  So, if you take it, know your limits and if you do get depressed, it is best to go see your doctor and be honest with them!  If they dont' know what you have taken, they can't help you.

146	3	a	I recently went to a doof on the north coast of NSW Aus, I had a great time.  I dropped 2 different pills 1.5 hours between, one of which i have had many times before.  I became pretty much paralytic, and had mild hallucinations.
147	3	a	2 weeks later i went to a rave, had 2 pills 1.5 hours between, nothing, except a little bit happier.  I had a break of 1 week, went to a concert, had 1 pill and some G, the G was awesome, but barely felt my pill. had another 1 week break.  Then last weekend, had a trip the night before the doof, then went to the doof, 2 pills, 1 point, same thing again, felt a little happier, but nowhere near the experiences that i have had before.
148	3	a	I'm thinking i need a little break but everything is way too tempting.  I'm going to HAVE to take a couple of months break so i can once again enjoy my drug of choice.
149	3	a	I don't know whether it could be the prescription drugs that i am on, warfarin, cipramil (which i don't take if i'm planning on dropping) and Flower essences (i'm a case study for a friend at college).

151	3	a	MDMA (3) : Rave / Dance Event (18), Loss of Magic (34), General (1)
152	3	a	So, i've dropped pills before but theyve all been the equivalent of maybe a half dose.. I never actually got the full on feeling..
153	3	a	Anyway, I aquired an igloo pill... I went home and tested it with my newly recieved marquis reagent and it turned black.. I decided that i was gonna take it at a large event coming up.. I also had a euro pill left ... I had aquired 3 euros a year ago and dropped on two occasions with effects, but less than satisfactory..(BTW they also tested black)..
154	3	a	So, the night of the event (jam band kinda thing,  but pretty massive) comes and I'm stoked... I take the igloo and the euro with, just in case the igloo isnt strong enough.. I'm determined to have a 'strong experience'.. Sadly, i go by myself, but given the nature of ecstasy, i figure ill make friends.. I always see people rolling at concerts.. I also pack up with some blue glowsticks with ropes, and a vix inhaler..
155	3	a	When I get to the event, I have to sit there in painful anticipation for a few hours..  I decide to drop after the first band, so that my peak will wear off right as the event ends(If all goes as planned).
156	3	a	When they are finished, I drop the igloo.. tastes bitter, good sign. I go and sit in the grass and wait.. I start noticing some perceptual changes.. Like the tendency to notice things more. Nothing strong.. When the band comes on i feel the come up.. Theres this warm sensation that encompasses my entire midsection.. Its that feeling you get when you desperatly want to be held.. My mood lifts and i go and dance with some pepple i dont know, but dont talk to them.. this pill isnt very strong.. in fact these are the same weak effects i got with the euros.. So after 30 min i pop the other pill and keep dancing.. Up tot this point im feeling good, but not rolling.. I would have this little peaks of excitment that went along with the peaks in the music.. I was at a ++.. Then the second pill hit..
157	3	a	When, it hit all i could so was 'Oh shit'.. To describe the feeling is like decribing the color green to a blind man.. So this is what everybody's talking about.. So this is ecstasy..
158	3	a	It hit in a mindblowing rush.. It feels as if every nerve in my body has been electrified.. This invisible 50 pounds that id been carrying all my life, was lifted off my shoulder.. I floated from place to place.. Colors were brighter, but more noticably richer.. 
159	3	a	Its amazing, when I'm on E, people seem to come up to me.. every single person that approached me, i felt was my friend.. The cheesy love that expected was not, but filled with a deeper sense of kindred,  more of this feeling of unity.. how we're all in this together.. Most of them were drunk.. I listened to this one guys drunken story about shrooms for 10 mins., and i was amazed at how well i listened and connected with him.
160	3	a	The body rushes were so insane at one point that i had to sit down and just watch.. i could definitly not drive in this state. Everything, looked crisp and defined.. my voice seemed to come from deep within me.. I had a bit difficulty talking, as in forming the words that i wanted to say.. After this flooring rush wore off, the speedy effects came on, and i danced my ass off, with the glowsticks.. I didnt care if I looked like an ass.. In threat to my ego became non existent..
161	3	a	I normally am socially introverted, and have difficulty initiating conversations with people.. X eliminates any embarassment, social hangups, and fear of rejection that you may have with strangers, escpecially girls for me (I was even rejected once, and i just shook it off as their loss).. Talking essentially came with ease and my mormally poor self image was boosted by 1000%.. When i looked in the mirror i notcied my attractive qualities, instead of dwellling on the negative.. My eyes were the coolest things in the world. Girls would come up and hug me, cuz they knew the E feeling, and it was the most postive reinforcement ever.. Warm energy flows thru you and you see people as genuine beings instead of just people..
162	3	a	Thruout the night, I hung out with probably 7 different groups of very accepting people.. I was given a light show, and figured what all that was about.. Just waving it in front of my eyes made them vibrate wildly and make me go weak in the knees and almost fall of.. Interesting phenomena.  When the concert ended on that final song, and the crowd was going nuts, i felt a part of human kind.. A part of some great benign energy flowing thru us all.. 
163	3	a	Amazingly, my peak wore of over 20 minutes after the concert.. I hung around and had some even better conversations.. I think the final hour of X is the best for therapy, because you are empathetic and you social barriers are still down, but you arent rushing so hard your mind is clouded.. you feel very lucid.. I had a nice conversation with a girl from alabama, and she talked with me until i was sober enough to drive.. The final comedown wasnt even as bad as an amphetamine comedown! I even got to sleep easier. The next day i still felt a connection to people and i felt happy and energized.. I think prozac on the comdown helped alot.. 
164	3	a	In conclusion, i think MDMA is a wonderful tool to show how we should interact with people .. It lets see a person for what they are and not just a pretty or ugly face. Ecstasy is the drug for me!

167	3	a	I am an infrequent user of X.  I've only used it once in the last 6 months and that was 3 months ago.  Last week, I had to take a pre-employment drug test as a condition of hiring.  They did a hair test off my legs (I have short hair), and I came up over three times the positive/negative cutoff (18.6/5).  The test was meant to find the NIDA-5 within the last 90 days, but the test results that my employer got specifically pinpointed the positive as MDMA.  I don't think I'd pass in another two weeks as high as the result was.

169	3	a	I took 1 tab of MDMA about 1:00am on December 24th.  The effect of the pill took about 40 minutes to kick in.  At first I had a sick feeling in my entire body, followed by a sudden rush of energy.  A feeling like I would expect from Crystal Meth.  Within 20 minutes of these first effects, I experienced an awareness of touch and sound.  Everything had a softer side to it.
170	3	a	The total experience lasted until 8:00am.  I then slept for 3 hours.  Upon waking, I felt very week, and very thirsty.  Kind of fuzzy in the head, like a long night of drinking.  I attended holiday functions that afternoon, and upon returning home I took another tab about 8:00pm.  I again felt the sickness in my stomach, and never reached the peak I had experienced earlier that day.  About 11:00pm I took another tab, this time without the sick feeling, but a very strong peak.  Again with strong effects of touch and sound.
171	3	a	I finally went to bed about 3:00am on December 25.  I woke up about 8:30am and again had a need for some water.  All day I have experienced a mild sick feeling in my entire body, and some joint pain.

174	3	a	It was about 10pm and me and my friend decided to roll in the hot tub. We took red dragon which is very strong and its pure mdma. This being my second time rolling, I wanted to start rolling in the hot tub.  My first time I took one and a fourth in Vegas and that was amazing so we thought the hot tub would be even more amazing.  
175	3	a	A half hour went by and the water felt amazing. About an hour later we took another roll.  When it was all said and done we took a total of 4.  So we were just enjoying the hot tub when my neighbor said her dog jumped over my wall and her dog couldnt get back over.  Rolling hard I walked over there and by this time I was freezing and clenching my jaw I had to go put some pants and a robe on. When I came back out the dog and my neighbor was gone.  I started tripping out and getting all paranoid.  This is when it started to get interesting. My house and back yard was pitch black.  So the shadows started playing with my head.  
176	3	a	At first I started seeing a hutch to my right. At first I started seeing a hutch to my right. It was very vivid and had a ton of detail it was dark and woven.  Then I looked up at the street lights and they changed colors from yellow to orange and had a glass lamp over them.  Then when I was looking past the street light I saw a round almost like a baby toy but it was bigger than my neighbors two story house and it had squares in it and some popped out with different signs on it. I closed my eyes to see if it was really there but it wasnt it disappeared.  Then I told my friend what I saw and he said he could see the hutch but not the ball. Then when I looked straight ahead where there was a dead tree with no leaves on it the tree turned into a palm tree with really bright colored branches that moved in the wind. They were baby blue, baby pink, yellow and the bottom of the tree was like a palm tree it was really really pretty.  Then I left my back door open and all the lights were out and there was this dog that was walking in and out of my house and a man appeared in the doorway he looked almost like a hunter but he never came out of the doorway.  He seemed like he was a hunter.  Then there was another dog that came out and went back in throughout my trip. I think that my neighbor really made me paranoid but this felt so real it was crazy. 
177	3	a	This next part gives me Goosebumps.  When I looked straight ahead there were these giant men there were like 15 of them walking in the street in between my house and my neighbors house across the street.  They kept walking over my wall and my neighbors wall.  Then all of a sudden there was a giant pallet and they were working on my neighbors house and got like halfway through the pallet when it finally started wearing off.  Apparently my friend and I were rolling balls for 6 hours in the hot tub.  If we werent tripping so hard music would have definitely helped our trip.  Then I finally got out and made him go inside first to make sure there was no one in there. 
178	3	a	I hallucinated everything the only thing that was really there was that dead tree with no leaves. Apparently my friend who has done this many times before said that hes never heard of someone hallucinating that much just on mdma.

180	3	a	MDMA (3) : Entities / Beings (37), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
181	3	a	I had only recently started using ecstasy on a weekly basis.  Once a week seemed like a decent amount, not too much and with a good break in between each trip.  Then I got tempted into dropping two days, back to back. I got tempted into dropping two days, back to back.  I didnt think much of it: okay, Ill just be a little more cracked out Sunday.  And I was just a little more tired, a little more brain-dead.  
182	3	a	However, Sunday night was a nightmare like Ive never experienced before.  I was lying in bed with my boyfriend, almost asleep but already in a nightmare.  I was in an auditorium with flashing lights.  There were little girls surrounding me.  They were all looking at me smiling.  Their eyes were perfect black circles, dark and deep, sucking me into their world.  I couldnt take it anymore and pulled myself out with a gasp of fresh air.  I woke my boyfriend up and told him to turn the lights on for me, that I was having a nightmare.  He told me everything was okay and to go back to sleep.  The second I put my head back down on the pillow I was sucked back into the dark.  The girls with the extremely dilated eyes smiling at me, digging into their hearts.  Their faces started to swirl as they passed their black hearts over to me.  It was so horrifying but I couldn't stop staring at them.  They were terrifying and loving at the same time, almost like the drugs I have been using.  I woke up to my boyfriend shaking me, telling me to wake up.  
183	3	a	I told a friend about this experience and he pondered whether it might have been my mind and body telling me to stop using ecstasy so much, that I was imagining Kandi Girls: strangely happy girls with dilated eyes, pouring their love out to me but in a way that might hurt themselves.  It may have been my mind telling me that ecstasy could only make me happy to a certain extent.  After that it, the happiness would be false, a strange, dark happiness that, like the Kandi Girls, could lead to injury of my mind and body.

186	3	a	Welp, a few things. I've taken e before a few times, but never pure mdma powder. Also, I have been friends with my boyfriend for many years, many many years, best friends, and about eight months ago he kissed me one night and we've been together ever since. Except for periods of extensive fighting over the past two months, which have caused me to move out. Most recently I had to be physically removed from the 'premises' aka our home because I was being violent and causing a domestic disturbance. I digress (but  these things generally resolve themselves).
187	3	a	So after fighting all day on valentines day and I had been waitressing for seven hours at a restaurant, he decided that I could come over and we could hang out on the condition that if he asked me to leave, I had to leave. Around eleven I get to the house determined to cheer him up so first I act goofy, then I announce that I want to eat the molly and if he won't eat it with me I'll do it all by myself. He just had surgery on his nose so we ate it instead, first he licked his finger and dipped in the powder and fed it to me, then he ate some. We hung out for an hour, nothing really happened, so we ate more. 
188	3	a	About a half hour after that I started to feel kinda tingly and thought 'Shit, this is it!!!' and ran to the bathroom to check out my pupils. FREAKIN' HUGE SON. So I ran back and forth to the bathroom a couple times, my pupils were monstrosities, I was afraid the black was going to seep out of the 1mm of brown left and just pour into my eye (not because I was paranoid or freaking out, but because I was like, whoa, dem eyes is huge). 
189	3	a	So then we just hung out and I started to feel very chill, explaining that I really wanted our relationship to work, I had been driving him apart from me for the past few months, I needed to trust that he loved me and wouldn't cheat on me, then obviously I cried a little bit and he said that he hated to see me cry. We were mushy gushy for a few minutes, but in a serious manner. Then we listened to John Legend and laid on the bed.
190	3	a	At this point I started calm down, and was like, 'This can't already be the come down.' It was only 1:45am. So we ate more. I noticed that it definately came in waves, unlike the e pill I had eaten a few months earlier. I also noticed that this was much less intense then the e pill, meaning I wasn't talking nearly as fast, I wasn't as ridiculously psyched, I was just very warm and chilled out. I likened the molly to being a warm glass of milk. 
191	3	a	So about every hour we kept eating more doses. Then (wellllp I'm about to be frank here), I was laying on my belly and felt something in my butt. Yes, my boyfriend took the liberty of just putting molly in my bum. HA! Buuuut it worked. A few moments later I jolted up, revived, and really rolling. However my bum did burn a little bit. 
192	3	a	We chilled a little more, continually re-upping, and at 7:45 we contemplated another dose but I was like 'nah, its eight, we gotta save some more' (he had bought a gram of pure a few months ago, I would say we had half left, meaning we each took a quarter of a gram). 
193	3	a	The next day we literally laid in bed until four, sometimes waking up, sometimes napping, just cuddling with our black 100lb hound dog and 20 something pound cat. It was crowded but nice.
194	3	a	Then I noticed I was still feeling a little gooey, grinding my teeth, and exclaimed 'What if the molly you put in my bum is stuck in some crevice and its going to continually and slowly release itself and I'm fucked up for like three days?!' But that (unfortunately) was not the case.
195	3	a	Walking was really hard (probably from the molly AND from being sedentary for about 18 hours) and taking a shower was tough. I just sat under the water. Went and got breakfast and ordered bacon... Holy shit, my teeth were so sore from the grinding that the bacon was killlllllllling me. I ate about a half a pancake and was fulled up. 
196	3	a	In conclusion, molly and e were different. Molly was actually more mild, but next time I'm going to eat a whole shiteload off the bat and see what happens. Yes, some will probably go up my bum. With molly I grinded my teeth a lot (but not with e), so yeah. 
197	3	a	 Definately helped us relax and for me personally, I came to a lot of conclusions about needing to grow up and trust my boyfriend, he's 26 and I'm 21 so I really need to stop acting like a little hs biddie and believe he loves me. Furthermore, with e the next next (ie sunday) day was a bummer, I was sorta depressed and thought 'Oh my god, he will never love me as much as he did last night ever again!!' but with the molly I'm  just back to my normal self. 
198	3	a	I love this drug but I know if I do it more than once a month I'll destroy my brain. Unfortunately :o )

201	3	a	I've smoked weed for about a year now and do it pretty much everyday.  AT LEAST once everyday.  Then I decided to move onto other things and heres my story about E
202	3	a	--------------------------------------------------------------------
203	3	a	Thanksgiving day after I was all done eating me, my brother, his friend and his girlfriend were chillin watchin some TV when we decided to go out.  A couple days before I had asked my brothers girlfriend to pick me up a pill cuz I wanted a sure thing my first time and she had some trustworthy friends.  On our way to buy some weed I was debating whether or not to do it that nite...I decided to(obviously).  So I chewed it up so it would hit me quicker and godamn did it taste awful.  I washed it down with some applejuice and waited...
204	3	a	We rolled up to the usual dealin spot and no one was there...so we were leavin and we saw this pretty shady lookin man standin outside of 7-11 so we pulled in there and asked him for some bud...long story in the end we lost $40 and ended up with no bud then I was completely blown.  We went to pick up another friend and as I got out of the car it just began to hit me.  I was smilin dancin talkin all pasionetly and I cant even describe the feeling of hapiness I had inside me. I'm usually an incredibly happy guy cuz I just dont enjoy being sad but I have never been so boosted as I was then. This friend that we had just picked up happened to be a girl and happened to have expierience with X.  I was completely in love. Just everything about her seemed so cool! We went to ANOTHER friends house and picked up some marajauna, then my brother told the story of how we were hustled and the man hooked us up with even MORE bud.  We smoked some marajauna and I was smilin and bobbin my head to the music and/or talkin about everything that seemed important to me. We dropped the friend off we had just picked up and had a total of four people in the car.  We went to pick up another friend and I went into his house...
205	3	a	I looked in the mirror and my pupils were incredibly dilated.  Like my entire eye was black but I was cheesin so hard.  I wandered around my friends house and saw a picture of his lil sister who is a year older than I am and I fell completely in love(again).  We left(I didnt get a chance to meet his sister unfortunetly) and went to the bowling alley.  We got in and did our thing and started to bowl when I realized that there were sooooo many people in the bowling alley.  I told this to my brother and he pointed out there were only about 100.  I did some math in my head and figured that there are 50 million times that amount of people on this earth.  I wanted to talk to all of them!! I wanted to talk to all of them and change all of their lives. 
206	3	a	So were at the bowling alley so I was bowling and I was INCREDIBLY rollling and I was INCREDIBLY high and my first few bowls were awful...I actually tossed a ball in the air it sucked so bad but I was still happy cuz I was rollin like no other. After bowling we dropped one friend off and then my brother off at home so he could pick up his car and take me home the next morning(we were sleeping over at his girlfriends house).  When we got to my brothers girlfriends house I found out that my parents were so pissed off at me becuse they didnt know I was sleeping out that nite and they wanted me home rite away.  I was rolling so hard and it would have bummed me so bad to go home. I convinced my brother to let me call my parents and he said 'ok I dont know if it will help I argued with them for 30 minutes and they didnt budge an inch.' so I call my parents at 1 in the morning and...I ended the conversation in control with the outcome I wanted.  My brother was goin nuts cuz he thought we were in deep shit and I was gonna get caught.  We watched batman, drove a friend home at 3 AM and I went to bed
207	3	a	Jesus christ I learned so much from this expierience...THERES ALMOST NEVER A REASON TO BE SAD...this is my life philosophy.  The one downside however is that when I get bummed I'm completely blown...but that rarely happens.  Also xtc is not a 'fuck up' drug it doent fuck you up...it enhances everything...touch...sound... Sight...it helped me get out of that situation with my parents. I love MDMA, but its too expensive... Thats my expierience.

210	3	a	Ive been smoking chronic since I was 16. Ive been experimenting with stronger drugs since the first time I tried mushrooms. X to me is like a wonder drug.  The reason I say that is every time Im down or the stress that life brings can sometimes be overwhelming, and X has always guided me out of life's troubles. I first time I tried x, I took two pills and had a blast! The second time I tried x, was about two weeks ago.
211	3	a	Ive been having so much stress from work and my girlfriend from 5 years recently broke up with me so I took two x pills to elevate my mood my girlfriend from 5 years recently broke up with me so I took two x pills to elevate my mood. The x I took this time was way more potent than the last beans I got last time. These purple rhinos came up quick; I immediately felt it within 30 minutes. Covering myself in a warm blanket with some techno in my living room, I started to question my life, religion, and my ex girlfriend. No more worries, no more stress just pure happiness.  About an hour later into the trip, my living room became a living rainbow. All the color were so vivid, and the longer in stayed wrapped in my blanket the harder I would trip.  
212	3	a	Ive never felt so free, and I can honestly say. I forgot about my relationship and was stressing me and it never came back. Not to mention all the crazy hallucinations while peaking. My peak lasted about 1:30, the plateau 5:00 and I crashed for the rest of the next day.

216	3	a	Took 1.4 grams of mdma crystal and was off my face completely. My jaw was rattling up and down so violently that I knocked a tooth out of place. An my eyes were bouncing round 180 degrees. Which at times was very strange. I couldnt focus on anything at all. They were going side to side and up and down every 3 seconds it seemed. An on the come up spewed hard an was rushing so hard it felt amazing. 
217	3	a	But days afterwards my mouth is still bone dry with ulsers all over my tongue. And I have a strange sort of light headed headache constantly. An my memeory is that of a goldfish I'm forgeting everything like wat I have walked upstairs for an stuff like that. 
218	3	a	Overall it was an awesome buzz but I feel I shouldnt feel this bad still at 4 days ago I took it.

221	3	a	This is just another one of the mind expanding experiences I've had thanks to drugs. The day before this trip I had taken a 1/4 Roll of a 'CP' pressed ecstasy (which am I assuming made my serotonin levels unbalanced for my trip). I bought 3.5gs of shroom caps from a hippie that sells me great acid and potent shrooms. I've had good and bad mushroom trips in the past with visuals, mind fucks, etc... This trip I had extremely faint visuals that I had to focus my complete attention on.
222	3	a	I ground the caps (mushrooms w/o the stems) up and filled them into seven .5g capsules and ate them around 8pm. During the trip I became bored of this low serotonin mediocre head space so I decide to roll all my weed into joints. I smoked an hour after dosing to alleviate any nausea, this brought nothing to my trip. I facetimed my girlfriend, although we conversed it was difficult for me to bring up topics while I rolled joints on my desk. Less difficult than say being loaded on 500mics of Cid. When I saw my face in the selfie camera I could see my face looking 'Shroomy' but not the 'crackhead' look of Acid.
223	3	a	I found this trip neither good or bad, but a waste of $40. Perhaps I had a weak strain of shrooms (which is not likely from my hippy) so I accredit this wasted trip to my MDMA use the night before. Moral of the story, I'll stick to the green sticky icky if I plan on taking a trip into my sub-conscious anytime soon.

226	3	a	Setting: ULTRA festival 2002 in downtown Miami with three of my friends (a techno/DJ music festival)
227	3	a	Mood: A little depressed, alienated from the people around me. I think to myself I guess this MDMA pill should set things alright, thats what there for!
228	3	a	I take the pill as the sun is setting. An hour later I had the worst experience of my life. Pacing around the concert hall trying to fight my body from having a seizure or a heart attack. Never have I felt this physically sick. It was absolute psychosis...So I ditch the place and end up walking around downtown Miami for 3 hours until this crap wears off.
229	3	a	I did not realize love or empathy like MDMA has done to me in the past. I realized the pain and suffering of the world we live in every day. Overall a very depressing and psychotic experiece. I will never do X again.

232	3	a	Halloween was coming up and me and some of my closer friends were tryin to figure out something fun to do for this festive occasion.
233	3	a	We first tried looking for some LSD as to have a magical and comical trip, but thoes plans soon feel through. Then another oppourtunity arouse, we had the chance to buy some pure ecstasy from one of my friends family members. This was my first expeirience with E by the way and I was told it was going to be a really good roll. So I was pretty psyched about it. 
234	3	a	The time came for us to pop the pills, we each ingested them at around 5:30 p.m. Just before having a lil smoke before hitting the streets. Well the weed was the shittiest weed I ever smoked in my life (well we got it for free so what was I supposed to expect)so it wore off by the time the pill kicked in.
235	3	a	Well the shwag we had was a pretty shitty start to the night, my back began to hurt and I was feeling tired and lazy. So we sat down to eat some candy, at this time its now 6:10, when all the sudden soemthing amazing came over me. I looked over at one of my friends and just began to laugh, but it wasnt like a stoned laugh where something stupid is funny, it was just because I got so extremely happy for no obvious reason. This was deffinatley more then I expected so I jumped up off the curb we were sitting on and exclamied how happy I was and all the euphoria and energy that was surging through my body. About 15 minutes later all 5 of us were rolling face. Well the first part of the roll was very exciting and I wanted to talk to as many peoiple I could find, going up to strangers asking them how they are doing, and how I love there house designs. I just felt so at one with every living thing. They were all my best friends. And you couldnt imagine how greatfull I was for the friends I was with and had. We walked all around shareing personal things or feeling we had. Stuff that we kept secret to the world, I can remember telling them how I loved them and I wanted to stay friends with them forever. The feeling I got from this drug was so unique and amazing, I was just so happy to be alive and experiencing this. Now its about 2 hours later and I'm still rolling very hard, its about this time when we run into some other friends of ours, they offer us some weed so we go smoke with them, BAD IDEA! The stoned asses and our rolling dumbasses decided to smoke in the middle of an open park. I didnt even realize how stupid this was because of how happy I was just to be there. Well a little bit after we light up the bowl a few times, as I'm exhaling a bright light shines at the side of my face. My heart jumps and I dont know what was runnign through my mind, but at that moment I just walked away from the crowd, there was a few of my friends off to the side a little and I waved them over.
236	3	a	Out of 9 of us , 3 of us had walked right away. A cop stopped us in the distance but let us go. We had ecscaped.
237	3	a	We were so nervous of what was about to happen to the rest of our friends, but about 15 minutes later we see one of them running down the street. Hes trying to catch up with us to let us know everything was alright, about 7 other cops showed up but let them all go for some very strange reason.
238	3	a	Well that was a little bit of a weake up call, most of my friends wanted to just go home after that, but I was rolling to hard to go home. So me and one other friend stayed out and roamed around, when we ran into these 2 girls we knew.
239	3	a	For some reason I was soo happy to see these people we barely knew, I was over social with them and I think they thought I was crazy. But we ended up spending alot of time with them. We got to know each other alot amd talked about our views of life and what was going on in the world. It was such an in debth conversation, all these feeling arouse out of nowhere, like me ego was stripped completely away from me, which was in a way, a very good thing. It allowed me to be honest, sympathetic, caring, and loving to everybody I met, and thats how I wanted to be able to feel without the drug. Finally the time came where I had to go home, my friends pill was wearin off and mine was somewhat also, but I was rolling harder than him, considering it was my first time and not his. So now its almost 11 and I get home. I go to my room and put on some music and sit and think about what I learned about myself and other people from the wonderful expeirience I had just lived through. Its over a year later now, and I have had zillions of other kinds of expeiriences with tons of different substances, but that night is still one of or maybe the most memorable and meaning night I have ever had. I recommend pure ecstasy for anyone trying to find there inner feelings on life and the people aroudn them.
240	3	a	I have done E about a total of 17 times now, and the mental effect is nowhere whatsoever near the height it was at that first time, which is why I'm deciding to not do it again considering I think it might damage my brain. But whatever the damage, One try was worth it for me.

244	3	a	I tried x for the 1st time last night, I took half a pill of supposedly pure mdma, and I fell in total love with it. The whole experience was fantastic..everything went real smooth, I had a little bit of dry mouth and my throat swelled up a little bit, but I kept drinking water in moderation (not too much, but enuough to make up for wat my body was losing) and everything went great, until the next day...
245	3	a	I'm not depressed, I'm not angry or anything negative like that. I just really really really want another hit like right now lol and I'm thankful I'm strong willed enough to tell myself no, to wait until the weekend. 
246	3	a	I'm not on any medications as of now (Non- Stimulant strattera, I stopped taking it about 3/4 weeks before my first hit), I was alone for my first hit as well, very relaxed and laid back and just blasted my speakers out with house music..it was crazy

249	3	a	Last friday I was able to get my hands on two ecstacy pills named 'Red Strawberries', never trying ecstacy I was kind of scared about hearing all the stories of neurotoxicity and all that nasty stuff. I also was expecting it to be somewhat similiar to Adderall.
250	3	a	6:00pm: ingested one pill on an empty stomach.
251	3	a	6:30pm: It hit me like a ton of bricks, my scalp and my skin tingled, I was getting warm rushes through my body, and one thing too add it was a little to intense at times, I got really dizzy and paranoid I was going to have a heart attack, but that subsided, I was in the car with my dad on the way to an NA meeting, I remember hearing the music on the radio and it was the greatest feeling ever, I felt so content and happy and I felt connected with the music. 
252	3	a	7:00pm:  My pupils were dilated and were like the size of dimes, very very huge, I noticed a lot of jaw clenching also.
253	3	a	After that the high was pretty level with all the positive effects I said above, not to forget I had real extreme feelings of love and emphathy for people. The comedown wasn't nearly as bad as amphetamines.
254	3	a	I am currently craving VERY badly to do more ecstacy, as it seems I have no where to find it, this is a hell hole, I almost regret taking it.

257	3	a	The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
258	3	a	A few days ago, I wound up snorting and eating what I was later told was about 3 to 3.5 grams of ecstasy over a period of around 24 hours. 
259	3	a	Based on my experience with this substance long ago (fifteen or so years), I can report that I am certain it was very clean, and there were no physical hangovers. I spent most of the time stretching, and had a mild sweat during which time I felt that I was flushing out deep seated toxins from my body through the E and the stretching. 
260	3	a	Two days after this experience however, I noted a kind of lingering dizziness which continues now, a day later. I noted a kind of lingering dizziness which continues now, a day later. It is a tingly lightness that doesn't feel bad, or weakening, but does remind me of the very early onset of a fainting feeling. There is no 'downer' mood alteration whatsoever - which I suspect has something to do with the cleanliness of the substance - but the fact that this dizziness has been going on now for about 36 hours, I am mildly concerned, but comforted by the fact that  this effect can continue for 'up to' 4 weeks in most cases. 
261	3	a	In any case, had I known that I would have this effect, which I now learned of afterwards, I certainly would not have ingested as much as I did.

264	3	a	This past Saturday at around 10:00 PM me and a friend took a blue circular mint that was mdma. My friend rolls every few months but it has been a few years since the last time I rolled. Around 3 years ago I rolled 3-4 times and never had any problems. But this time I did. 
265	3	a	My friend started to feel sick to his stomach about 20 minutes after we took it, and almost vomited. But the nausea went away and he started feeling it. After about 1 hour and 20 minutes I suddenly got really nauseous and went to the bathroom and vomited quite a bit. I didn't see any of the blue pill in my vomit so I figured the pill had absorbed. I really didn't feel it like I thought but I think I still was rolling a bit. But all I wanted to do was sit in my room for the rest of the night. My friend who had taken the same pill as me rolled and felt great the entire night. 
266	3	a	The next day on Sunday I felt terrible, couldn't eat and had depression and anxiety occurring. Today is now Monday and I woke up feeling almost worse then the day before. Extreme depression and continuing anxiety, also I haven't eaten all day and still am not hungry. I am thinking about going to see a doctor because I just cannot put up with this feeling.

268	3	a	MDMA (3) : What Was in That? (26), Hangover / Days After (46), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
269	3	a	I started taking E in very calm settings about two years ago. It became more and more frequent, until I was rolling at least once per season before I decided to attend an actual rave. I was there for the music and it seemed a lot of people were there for the culture, so I decided raves weren't my thing. I don't even listen to electronic music normally. 
270	3	a	Then I tried going back to calm settings by myself which worked for a few months a couple of times up to this past month, where I rolled once every two weeks, the last being St Patricks day at my second and definitely final rave. I went to usher in a friend to the world of MDMA but obviously I wanted to roll a bit myself. I took 3 pills at 8pm, as opposed to my usual 2 pills followed by two more later on. The pills didn't have any magic, no euphoria, no empathy, no energy, no happiness. It was pure intense dizziness and vertigo mixed with irritation. I ended up sitting in my car for 4 hours smoking weed to make myself feel better before going home and having the worst hangover of my life from anything. 
271	3	a	I've gotten about 20 to 30 trips under my belt and it was great while it lasted, but it became terrible very quickly and is no longer appealing at all to me.

274	3	a	After a great night rolling on .6 (I felt wonderful and also took about 6 bong rips on the comedown which brought me to a whole nother level. I had wiggly eyes and everything) I got about 4 hours of sleep and worked for 8 hours on a super busy day in a restaurant. 
275	3	a	I didn't feel too bad at work but once I was home and with my significant other, I started to feel very depressed and layed in bed thinking way too hard about life and convinced myself life is going to suck. The next day I felt fine and completely happy with my life again until I got back from work. I started getting weird 5-second headbuzzes that felt good? Kind of unexplainable. And again, while I was laying in bed, things got pretty weird. I was looking at the ceiling (pretty dark in the room) and I started seeing visuals. The ceiling started to look like a pool of water that was wavy/ripply and wherever I'd look it would follow with where I pointed my iris. I also started hearing dishes clashing when I would get close to falling asleep. (That could just be from working too much.) 
276	3	a	I'm assuming these are all after effects of the mdma though since I had been sober since I took it.

280	3	a	A little background information to start off with.  My two friends and I are fairly experienced pot smokers, and have taken LSD on a few occasions, but what we really wanted to try was MDMA.  
281	3	a	We had planned this night for a while now and were very excited.  Before getting the pills we smoked a few bowls and drank a few beers, which may or may not have effected the outcome.  Anyway, at around 11 PM we got our 3 G-spot stamped pills and took them at 11:33.  Around midnight I began feeling warm inside while my two friends were not feeling anything yet.  Another half hour past and I felt at complete peace with myself and was very talkative, my two other friends still don't feel anything.  Finally at around 1 AM my friend L begins to feel it but M is still not feeling anything.  It really didn't get any better than this and at around 3 AM we all just felt completely tired and fell asleep.
282	3	a	The next morning we checked out pill data website and it turns out what we got was potentially simply MDA.  We felt it was a waste of our $20 (each) but are still excited to try the real thing.

285	3	a	When taking the drug I feel excited, and my problems and insecurities subside for the duration of the peak experience. I feel alert and can always have a great time out, the drug facilitates this. When 'coming down' from MDMA I gradually become paranoid and negatively self aware which makes being in public a nightmare. I will also say that the most annoying aspect of taking e is the rapid weight loss I experience, epecially in my face as my features appear extremely drawn and gaunt due to the drugs effects. I still gets cravings for ecstasy and I think this is more a 'craving' for the fun times I have had in the past. I like MDMA but don't like the comedown one bit.

288	3	a	This was to be my second time doing MDMA and my friend J's first. I had done Morning Glory seeds (to no effect), cocaine, mushrooms, and DXM before. J had done MG as well, along with Acid and coke, so we both have some background in phsychoactive chemicals. We had prepared a couple days in advance to do the MDMA, so our mindset and mood were both open.
289	3	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
290	3	a	I drove over to his house around 3 in the afternoon. He snorted one and ate one initially. I ate both of mine. We headed out on the road with me driving soon after to pick up some beer. The package store is only about 15 mins away and J was already feeling it by then. He was laughing and had a huge shit-eating grin on his face and couldnt stop talking about how awsome he felt. I hadnt started to feel it yet. We continued on driving down to a local plaza where J got out and promptly threw up. The MDMA was just starting to hit me then. I had the typical comming on signs of clenching of the jaw, and hot and cold flashes. We sat in the parking lot for a while and I started to get paranoid that people were looking at us. J said they weren't, but we left anyway. We got stuck in traffic on the way out and we were cranking the music just twitching and dancing about in the car. Music is one of the most wonderful things in life on MDMA.
291	3	a	When we got to the mall, I stopped driving as I was starting to get severely impaired. It was about 3 hour since we initially dosed and we decided to take the other 2 pills each. It was the perfect night out and J and I were having a blast. The moon and stars had just come out. All of a sudden J lifts his arms in the air and starts saying the puppet master had him. Apparently, someone in the sky had strings attached to his arms and was pulling them around. He asked me to tell the puppet master to let him go. I did and his arms dropped. Neither of us could see the puppet master, but we both beleive whole-heartedly that he was there, pulling on invisable strings. The puppet master snagged me a couple of times too, yanking my arms in the air. Everytime J would either tell him to let go or cut the strings. We spent the rest of our time at an awsome bar at the mall, enjoying the trip. When we went home later both of slept fine that night, but the next day I discovered I had been grinding my teeth and biting my tongue alot. Both were VERY sore.
292	3	a	All in all, it was a wonderful time we had on it. Both of us grew much closer to each other, talking about anything and everything. We have done it together a couple of times since and everytime has been extremely gratifying. Going to concerts is the best while on it. We have seen everyone from Flickerstick to Cold to Slipknot on MDMA and it was all great.

295	3	a	At my school they call it thizz... Thanks to Mac Dre. But I'm going to call it X. So about a month ago me and my friend decided we would try ecstacy and so we ventured to our nearest supplier and bought 2 red safeway pills for 30$. We thought it was a good deal and being that we were so exited to try it we bought it right away. With  the internet I had done research needed to know what exactly I was getting into and what I should do to prepare. So with a bottle in hand and a pack of chewing gum in pocket, I was ready to roll. Litterally. But once I had the water and was going to drop, I wondered about the authenticity of the pill and not knowing the dosage scared me a bit. And so I held on to the pill instead of taking it, for I was not as ready as I thought I was. My friend however did take the pill and had an awsome time. He explained it as the most perfect feeling of life in the world. So after watching him and seeing what it was like from a 2nd person's perspective, I was then ready to drop.
296	3	a	About a week later me and my buddy walked to the supplier after school. He had bought one pill and I had saved my pill from the last time. But still being very cautious I only took half of it and gave the other half to my other first-timer friend. I have to admit even though the effects were very faint I still felt very alive and real for once. And in the 4 hours that I had been rolling, I had felt a nice warm feeling of happiness in the world and felt alot more able to talk to people and get into conversations like never before. I felt like most of the people I was with had been rolling too, and that we were all feeling the same feeling in perfect harmony. I would even ask the question 'ya feel me?' almost every scentance... And they always said 'yes'... As if we were on the same page throughout the whole night. It was a very experiencial night and afterwards I felt like doing it again, only now I am ready to experiance the full effects of what we call 'thizz'.

299	3	a	The first time I tried Ecstacy was about 4 months ago. I had experience with a few other recreational drugs: cocaine and marijuana. 
300	3	a	I was with friends at a camping ground and it was a big crowd because we were there for an event. We had been drinking beer all day and spent some time in the sun. By the evening one of our friends showed up with the pills.
301	3	a	My friend I was there with split a pill with another friend, and I got .33 of a pill from another friend. After about 45 minutes, my friend was feeling the effects from her pill. I, on the other hand really didn't feel anything yet. I got another 1/2 of a pill. After an hour and a half, still nothing. I then took an entire pill. Within minutes I started feeling the effects. 
302	3	a	I don't know if there are 'better' pills than others when it comes to ecstacy. However, when the pills finally kicked in, I was in a very euphoric state. I found myself experiencing a lot of the stereotypical events that are experienced when taking ecstacy: chills, jaw clenching, increased alertness and sensitivity to touch. My friend and I got to the point where we were annoying other friends, we would touch each other's hands and exclaim 'you're so soft!!' 'Nooo...you're so soft!!' It was a fun experience. My heart was racing, I felt like I was at the top of the world. The euphoria spread throughout my entire body, however, the chills were unimaginable for me. It was a cooler night, around 50 degrees, and we had a fire going. I was so cold I couldn't get away from the fire. I would walk 20 feet and had to get right back because I was like ice. I had on jeans, shoes, socks, t-shirt, sweatshirt, and a jacket, none of that protected against the cold feeling caused by the drug.
303	3	a	The next morning I felt fine. No hangover affects from alcohol or racing heart, just a normal summer day to hang out with friends.

306	3	a	Thursday night I took half of an ecstacy tablet. I had never taken more than this dosage. I am not sure exactly how much MDMA and other substances are in each tab. I do know that some pills contain more than others. We classify these into three categories-a single stack tab, double stack, or tripple stack. Within these categories some are still stronger than others. Friday I took a whole double stack tab and Saturday I took two of these same tabs. While I was rolling everything felt good. I was experiencing all of the typical good euphoric feelings. However I noticed that in between each dosage (which we call 'powering up' around here) I was feeling worse and worse. Today is Monday and I haven't powered up since Saturday night. I have not been able to sleep well until last night and I completely passed out-in my clothes with the television and lights still on! Everytime I rise after lying down I am so dizzy. My head feels cloudy and I dont want to do anything that really requires m to concentrate. Lights have huge raiinbow colored rings around them and I keep twiching. While I sleep my leg or arm just jumps involutarily. It feels really wierd. I have been in a terrible mood and I've been snapping at people. When I first started I didn't notice any of these negative effets, but I can't help but notice them now. I feel like shit basically. Everytime after I power up, my throat becomes sore and I can't eat. I am going to lay off the ecstacy for a little while and see how long it takes for me to return to normal. If these negative effects worsen when I take it again, I'm just going to leave it alone because this just is not where it's at!!! :)

311	3	a	8:48 We smoked some strong medical cannibus to bring on the roll. Feeling a good indica cannibus stone but do not feel the classic extacy feeling expected. We ate before ingesting pills and wonder if this fucked it up. Still have some hope it will kick in. This 10 dollars is not going to waste.
312	3	a	10:59 The high is very strong and mellow. These are very good pills and definetly contain a lot of mdma for their small size. Opiate like very nice happy euphoria can be distinctly felt by both of us.
313	3	a	11:07 We loved these pills. Any more than one would be ridiculous. We have gained a certain respect for the chemical from this experience. Eating before definetly delayed the come-on but after about 2 hours it became the roll we wanted. 
314	3	a	11:14 Grinding of the teeth noticed and the lockjaw is not too enjoyable. A piece of gum does the trick.
315	3	a	11:39 Very fun ride would definetly want to do this again. Have not completely came down but am starting to drift back to the real world.

318	3	a	Well, its the next day, and I feel reborn. I had previously been very afraid to try ecstasy, but to my great surprise, It was a very fun and peaceful. I was at my friends property near a river and some friends had been doing this for the past couple of days, so I tried it. It was awesome, I felt nothing but pure peace, I was also drinking a lot of beer with no noticeable bad effects. I feel reborn today. No hangover present at all. One funny thing was when I got home at around 3:30 AM i walked out into my front yard, and sat down to look at the sky, my cat came over to me and I just kept petting him and telling him i loved him. I felt so connected to everything living, I was capable of empathizing with anyone or anything. It was a very personal but also a social experience, I will cherish this experience forever.

321	3	a	It was a panicky experience coming up, then sublime for hours.  I woke up the next morning and felt relatively cheerful, if a little fuzzy.  Only the fuzziness lasted until right before spring break (~6 days later).  When I finally got home (TN) from college (in AR), significant depression had creeped in.  I felt a lot of dread and some of that same panic (though without the same intensity) of coming up on the MDMA.  Nightfall upset my condition considerably, and the feelings hearkened back to my childhood fears, ones that were believed to have been overcome.  I've been given various times that it takes to overcome these weird feelings (most of them being around 2 weeks), but I have talked to my parents and am seriously considering going to see a psychiatrist.

324	3	a	Last year in September I took some acid. I was 22 years old and a skinny guy. I purchased some 3 x small card board tabs
325	3	a	Unsure of print or  Pattern. Me and a group of friend's were attending a music festival, I took my 3 tabs about 30-40 minutes from the festival at about 11.30am. I also should say I am a fairly experienced user of LSD with this not being my first trip.
326	3	a	I started to feel the effects as we walked threw the gates and past the boys in blue. It really did hit me hard, I walked with my friends and my one mate who I had tripped with before guide me into the festival, I remember a lot of things going ' klaidescope ' of whatever the spelling. It was really intense, everything was wobbly, and morphing like good acid should be, for a good 2 or so hours we walked around, meeting new people gathering supply's and just exploring, in that time I was just a mess, I don't remember much in that time. I don't remember much in that time. 
327	3	a	We came to the blue stage where some friends went one way some the other so me and a couple of people decided to sit around and wait. I remember sitting there talking to friends and constantly touching the grass,  at this part I remember two things:
328	3	a	1) there was a photo frame set up for people to stand in and it had the stage in the back ground, there was two girls dressed up, I would call them fairy girls,  I asked them to take my picture, one girl replied  'do you have a phone' I didn't really know what I was thinking I just wanted my picture taken and had this thought about me being in a picture in a picture. Lol. I salute the fairy's and sit back with my friends. 
329	3	a	2) Was my trip guiding friend saying something to me, I can't remember what it was but it cracked me up, so much I was in hysterics, I couldn't stop laughing for a good five or so minutes, the proper giggles it was good, what ever my spirit leader said did what he attended it to do. Good fellow 
330	3	a	From there we went and got food, I purchase two sausages rolls and tried to eat them both at same time whilst laughing with myself following my group around, another half hour passes and I come to a point I realise everyone else is dancing and I'm trying to eat sausage rolls. So I THROW my rolls down and dance in victory over those delicious pastry's.
331	3	a	Some time past partying and killing time we came to another stage sitting on the grass, at this point I fairly sore and was laying up and down looking at the clouds and feeling the grass, the clouds were making  triangle patterns into each other. Also there was another moment where I sat up having a cigarette with my eyes closed hallucinating the warmth of the sun made me feel like a golden orb of some sort. The moment past we danced some more seen more people walked around did plenty of things. My trip started to settle a bit and when we were standing at the back of the stage I could see the clouds all flare up like in a time lapse in a big circle all around the stage. It was magical. Over time my trip settled and I could have conversations more and just function normally.
332	3	a	Later in the night towards the end I dropped a cap, I was told to be MDMA, I had a mad rush of heat and threw up about 3 times I had a pretty bad experience from then feeling mainly sick. I surely did feel the M came up and was somewhat peaking on the ride home more then usual it was weird.  I got back to the hotel 12-1am that night and got warm.

335	3	a	It's a gorgeous drug. I love all my friends around me, and I'm 100% comfortable, even with the people I just met.
336	3	a	I paired this with marijuana, it makes it a chiller roll, where I feel calm but awake, happy, sociable, and like theres not anything wrong in the world. I also am pairing with tobacco. Cigarettes are a must since I smoke already. I'm also smoking hookah which is a great social activity if you have a group. I might be pairing with Ketamine tonight as well. Overall, molly is an amazing trip. It's definitely on the top of my favorite list, and I will continue to use from time to time.

339	3	a	Most of the time after I take ecstasy I do not experience much discomfort,usually just a little shakyness and as most amphetamines sleep and eating problems. I could even take MDMA two days in a row and not expierience much pain, usually......
340	3	a	But there are times when about a day after I take the ecstasy I get symptoms of sickness, which is actually horrible withdrawl. My bones ache and I feel almost as if I were like 70 years old and trust me I've got about 52 years until then. My throat starts to hurt and I get horrible headaches that enable me do virtually anything. These 'crashes' do not always happen however and it may just be certain kinds of ecstacy that cause this. I usually 'chill roll' when this occurs and the MDMA gives me symtoms of some sort of pain killer.....

342	3	a	I would like to share my latest Ecstasy expeprience with everyone so maybe someone can avoid the fear I got when something un-expected happens.
343	3	a	I did my first X pill about 1 month prior to this report. It wasn't much at all. Not even close to what I had expected. So I basically blew off $20.
344	3	a	Alright..now I knew a month later I was getting ready to do something again.. So I cleaned up my room so that me and my buddy would have a good enviornment to do our drug in.
345	3	a	4th of July my friend calls me and told me he can get us some really really good X. So naturally me and my buddy Trevor bought..hoping they would be better than our last rolls.
346	3	a	We got em around midnight and my friend took his pill right away.
347	3	a	Waiting about an hour and nothing happend. I was thinking 'well damn we wasted another $20'. Bummer.
348	3	a	I went and sat at the computer for another half hour and my friend comes to me with an amazed look on his face and told me 'damn dude this shit was worth the money and the wait'.
349	3	a	So by then my parents are asleep and I go ahead and drop my roll and waited. About a half hour later I felt really queezy and I was close to losing my stomache. I was talking to the guy who got me the X and he said this was normal.(I didn't experience this with the roll I took a month before.)
350	3	a	So I go to the bathroom and wait to puke and one of my other friends called me. I was talkin to him for awhile and I got a rushing to my head. I told my friend to hang on because I was coming up fast..so I close my eyes and let it hit me. At that point I thought I was peaking. Not even close.
351	3	a	Now, my dealer only told me I should have 1 rush and I'd be peaking.
352	3	a	I had an over whelming rush of happiness as I called him back and told him it was the best. I walk to my kitchen to grab a bottle of water and I get another huge rush to my head. Even more intense than the last..and that's when I start freaking out.
353	3	a	My dealer is like a brother to me..and if it wasn't for him I wouldn't be typing this today.
354	3	a	I was telling him that it happend again and that I thought I was gonna pass out..and I thought I wasn't breathing and he told me it was all in my head and that I need to calm down.
355	3	a	I calmed down and the rush was over and I was telling him that I'm having a good time again. It wasn't over.
356	3	a	I continue talking to him and I get a 3rd rush. Even more intense than the previous 2. That was it for me. I thought I was dieing. I wanted to cry and I couldn't concentrate on anything. I was pacing back and forth very fast and my hallway was waving around and I was scared to walk down it. I was telling my dealer that I think I was going to tell my dad to take me to the hospital. (I don't freak with every drug..but when I experience the un-expected I do freak out.) I ripped off my shirt because it was getting hot and I had this rash all over my chest..and I spazzed big time. My dealer told me it was just from the heat and I trusted him.
357	3	a	Now my friend who I was rolling with was spaced out and when I walked back in my room he saw I was freakin and he helped me through as well. 
358	3	a	As soon as I got to the peak it was all fine. I felt good, danced the night away and confessed my love to everyone.. Lol.
359	3	a	Bad trips are bound to happen I think I have to tell myself that I already took the drug and there is nothing I can do to stop it. It's in my system..don't fight it. Let it hit me and be positive and I'll have a great time.

361	3	a	MDMA (3) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
362	3	a	I had just moved back home and got a job at a grocery store where I met my future boyfriend (lets call him bob), who was new to my town. We started dating and I did ecstacy alot when I was with him (he didnt do any, it hurt his back). 
363	3	a	One night I walked to his house on 2 pills after spending an hour playing lesbian with my best friend. Bob was already stoned as usual. I had to go home since it was about 1 am, so he walked with me. The e started dying down so I took 2 more because I was obviously horny and expected to find some way to make passionate love to my man without waking my mother. We were sprawled out on my  rediculously small couch watching heavy metal 2000 when my high came on. I started getting intimate, until I heared my mom get up and go to the washroom. Bob announced he wasnt in the mood anyway. 
364	3	a	We sat on my back porch and had a smoke. I suddenly felt extremely hot and took my top off. It didnt really faze bob too much anymore since I always removed a peice of clothing or two when I was on X. I now felt determined to get bob in the mood and find a way to screw me. I went down on him lightly for 5 minutes, not enough to make him cum but just enough to get him worked up. 
365	3	a	We made love on my backyard from 2:00-5:00am no breaks. In the end I realized my high stayed throughout the whole thing. It was preobably the best sex I've ever had and it's all thanks to my pills.

367	3	a	MDMA (3) : Sex Discussion (14), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
368	3	a	I decided today was a good day to try molly for the first time.
369	3	a	At 4:00 PM I swallowed 100mg of MDMA in the form of a gelcap. Shortly after, a friend picked me up to play some soccer. It
370	3	a	was hot out and I was worried that I might overheat so Ibrought some water just in case.
371	3	a	Molly still hadn't shown her face yet at 4:40 PM and we decided to pay my friend Cherek a visit at Panera. I copped a cup for a drink to hydrate myself. It was 4:50 PM at this point, and man, she came on fast. I'd told Cherek I was on molly and I was starting to feel it, no, definitely feeling it. I couldn't keep a smile off my face, I was so euphoric. The body high was tingly, warm, and pleasant. Similar to if I had drank a cup of coffee and taken 10mg hydrocodone. After spending thirty minutes at Panera, and decided to go to my friend Rice's house.
372	3	a	We arrive at Rice's house and I'm watching him play video games, I am mesmerized, really into it. At 6:00 PM, my friend Kenji
373	3	a	I notice the effects coming down at 6:48 PM. Kenji and I left Rice's house at 9:00 PM. I was totally sober at this time, and the best part, literally no comedown. Upon reading up some more on the MDMA comedown, I discovered there would be little to
374	3	a	no comedown on doses below 150mg. Anything above 200mg is relatively safe but will leave one with a pretty shitty comedown and some post-roll deppression.
375	3	a	All in all, this just might be my favorite drug, too bad I have to wait 2-3 months to roll again because the shit is neurotoxic.

378	3	a	The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
379	3	a	So this is my first report of any kind but felt this ROA deemed qualities that deserved to be expressed. I have a fairly good amount of experience with this substance and was looking for something a little stronger. Now, me being completely against using needles, I was searching for info on what the best way to take this substance. Snorting has been my preferred method because of the rush but after researching what was better ORAL or Insuffaltion, I decided that I needed to research rectal administration. Now I have searched the BIOAVAILABILITY of just about every illegal substance known to man and ecery substance seemed to say the same thing: Rectal bioavailability>%80. So this sparked my interest and got me thinking, I wonder 'What kinda info I can find on google about plugging Molly...' So I immediately go to google and search for some experience with this and came up with NADA!
380	3	a	Now this is where I got to strap on my Psychonaut suit and venture where no man has gone before. I was gonna shoot 'molly' up my A-hole. Now, I have plugged morphine, and ecstasy pills before but what I experienced was unlike anything I have ever done. I measured out roughly .75 grams into a syringe with water and shot all the liquid in my ass. The tiny bit of liquid that trickled out burned like a MoFo. After the initial rest period to keep everything in, I sat up and started to await the effects. They kicked in relativiely fast.
381	3	a	Within 5 min I was in another world. Trippin, All out body High. Intense rushes of euphoria. I was unable to form sentences. I would answer questions nobody asked me.  Everything was melting and morphing. It was a mix between LSD and MDA. I stayed like this for a good hour before I started being able to form sentences.
382	3	a	ALl in all, this was way more than I expected.
383	3	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
384	3	a	It starts with a numbness in my arms and face then travels to my eyes. I keep me eyes closed rocking back and forth with a blanket shoved in my mouth. My vision shakes rapidly from side to side and I clench my teeth. I sway my head side to side and smile because it feels so amazing. I have no sense of time or my surroundings. I am with friends one high two sober. I tell the sober girl that she is annoying and her eye brows are ugly. She leaves. I run around my house because I think I am as fast a flash. I return to the couch and apologize to the sober boy for being such a bad host. I do this repeatedly. I confessed that I am bi. I tell everyone that I love them. The other high girl cries because her at died that day. I hug her. The sober boy is her bf and holds her. I text my brother about how he doesn't love me and he is my entire world. He tells me he loves me and I will be okay. I bawl my eyes out. I tell my high friend that the sober girl and her are getting really close and I am jealous and I love her and miss her. She is jealous of my new friend and loves me. We are best friends. I make the sober boy sad by talking about loss and his dead father. I am tired but can't sleep. For a week after I feel nauseated. I feel tired. I feel sad. But not depressed like usual. While high I bit two pieces off my tongue and three off my cheek I cut my lip open cut my toe and pinched myself so much that my fingers burned my skin. I love Molly. She is my main bitch.
