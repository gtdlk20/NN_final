2	This experience happened quite a while back. It was by no means my first or last experience with acid, but hopefully it conveys some of the reasons why it is my favorite drug.  Enjoy.
3	My boy E had just returned from a trip with an entire fifth gallon of liquid.  It was yet undiluted, and he graciously gave me 10 drops of it, equally distributed onto 5 space treats.  Although it was already past midnight, we glanced mischieviously at each other and knew it was time to ride.  We quickly got my girlfriend H to agree to the mission, and for the fourth traveler, we phoned my friend B.  We told him to go back to sleep and await further instructions from us in person.  E, H, and I hopped in my ride and took a 15min ride out to the country.
4	At 2am, we awoke B, who lives next door to one other house.  It was a cold, winter night and we shuffled indoors to stay warm.  Once indoors, B greeted us with some organic tea.  We lit candles and made ourselves comfortable with some Dj Cam.  We each took just 2 hits (later to become an inside joke), and centered ourselves for what was to become the energetic apheleon of our lives.
5	Although lsd usually takes an hour to come on strongly with me, I was beginning to get serious teeth chatter and body shaking within 15 minutes.  The tea made me have to piss, and when I stood up from the circle I tried to walk down the hall to the bathroom.  Already quite confused, I stumbled in the hallway and landed on B's bed (fortunately).  My friends were very concerned about the noise, but I assured them that I was OK as I burst into nervous laughter.
6	In the bathroom, the lights were out but just enough candle light came in for me to make out the fixtures.  Within seconds, my mind was tricked into thinking that the walls and doors had become some sort of 'ice'.  I started thinking of how get out, but then figured out where the door was and proceeded back down the hall to rejoin the group.  The group I came back to had been rapidly accelerating as well.  We joked about how crazy this was already becoming within 20 minutes of ingestion.  Little did we know.  The next hour or so are pretty vague in my memory.  First of all, an ice storm began to rage outside (literally).  We were marvelling at how the weather was mimicking our mental meteorology.  All of a sudden, the power went out.
7	We weren't too upset about the light because we were already on candle power, but the music went and the heat went almost as quickly.  This led to some confused negotiations about leaving or staying B's tiny and cold house.  We were pacing about the place, and in and out of the front door.  No one had any destination or idea what was happening.  B suggested we sit in his pathfinder to warm up for a moment.  We all piled in and the heat felt good.  While seated in the back with H, I was being taken down a tunnel into darkness at high velocity.  It looked as though I was levitating and flying over infinite rows of seats in a theatre with a luminous screen.  There was no sense of actual body.  When I tried to realize sensations, for example my hand, then I would trap a very vague concept of hand along with some mixed signals of whether or not I could feel my own.  The visuals were extremely intense and there was definitely some concern from B as to how to handle it, as he had never gone so hard or deep before.  Colors were literally pouring out of molecules of thin air and vaporizing into fractals of tangible reality.  There was very little difference between eyes closed and open because it was all becoming one concept.
8	B's confusion became sort of pathological and he wanted it all to end immediately.  E and I, the most experienced out of the Four tried to calm his fears despite our own dealings.  He got paranoid that the neighbors would hear us going in and out, and that the music was too loud (remember, the power was out).  In an effort to make it all stop, B told us to leave, as if he could just go back to sleep and pretend we never showed up with the liquid launch pad.  He literally locked us out, and we heard him rummaging around inside.  We tried to convince him to let us back in and that his idea wasn't going to work, but he wouldn't listen.  E, H, and I had no choice but to drive home.  Woah.
9	Now some people might get concerned that three travelers in our state of mind would take to the road in an ice storm.  H and I seriously questioned whether this was even conceivable, but E assured us that he had it as long as I could back out of B's long, steep driveway.  My black car loomed before us like a dragon, huddled together against the cold.  It breathed and swaths of paisley camoflauge spun off its back.  We got in and began to leave.  E took over the controls once on the road and I in shotgun.  We pumped the drum and bass on my system and let the heat flow.  The experience of moving at high velocity was breath-taking in our heightened state.  Everything visual and tactile was so warped.  Suddenly, H grabbed my shoulder from the back seat and squeezed the hell out of my arm.  With great fear in her voice, she told me she was falling into nothingness.  I tried to calm her down and told her that we would take care of her, but she was really on her own.  Her energy spun me for a loop and I could no longer tell where we were.  I thought seriously how crazy it was getting in B's house, but didn't understand anymore that we were in my car.  E had his shit on lockdown though, cuz we were all of a sudden in my parking lot.  Scared H wanted my keys to get in the house, and I sat back to see if she could figure out how to get in.  She almost started crying but I ran up to show her how to use them.  She looked at me like I was some sort of magician.  
10	Indoors and with power on, we continued to experience massive amounts of spacetime distortion.  While talking to H in one room, I explained how strange it was upstairs and she told me I hadn't been up there yet.  I started to geek out at how confusing it was on this unprecedented level of tryptamine infusion.  We couldn't decide on what was really happening, so at some point we just chose to surrender to the hyperreal vortex of particles and energy.  My sober roommate awoke to have us turn down the music.  We just started laughing at how he floated in and out of the universe we created.  Until we saw him, no one had even considered the possibility that there were others in this place who weren't experiencing the same thing.  In my mind, there was absolutely no concept of sobriety left, and all sense of ego was dissolved.
11	We went to my room to sit and enjoy the ride.  H dissolved into the bed and didn't move for the longest time.  E and I just looked around the room and felt.  My room, lights on, was transformed into a 4 walled patio with a perfectly clear and starry night sky overhead.  Don't ask how, it just was.  B called my house and said that he had calmed down and wanted some company again.  We told him to ride on over if he felt comfortable driving.  He was down and 20 minutes later was at the door.  Upstairs we all synthesized some incredible energy flow and transfer.  H finally snapped back into our consciousness with a big smile on her face.  She said she had gotten lost in the bed, but was glad to be back.  The positivity we felt after getting through the first few hours was incredible.  For an hour in that room, we just sat in silence and looked around.  It was the surface of an alien planet in a time when none of us existed.  The speed and variation of the visuals was sooooo intense.  One thing I remarked about using lsd of this concentration is that the crystalline structure of my visual field was composed mostly of large pieces.  This is one reason why it made it so difficult to discern what the physical world was.  LSD of a lesser concentration seems to appear as smaller particles which allow one to see what objects are versus space.  
12	After what seemed like eons, we realized dawn was breaking outside and we wanted to go for a stroll.  Up we walked on the slick street behind my house.  The trees were totally encased in ice down to the last twig.  The sun reflecting through this giant prism was unforgettable and amazingly beautiful.  All of a sudden, we heard a loud 'crack', and an enormous tree (70' oak) fell across the street right behind us in slow motion.  The noise and sight were unbelieveable, drugs or no drugs!  We were so awe-struck, that we questioned whether it had really happened or not.  After a minute of playing on the tree, we chose for it to be real.  It entirely blocked the street and narrowly missed crushing two parked cars.  We continued walking.  Sometimes I felt too conspicuous to be outdoors whilst blowing up so hard.  I thought that I was throwing up my insides and turning back out in a continuous cycle of mental v physical awareness.  It proceeded like a hollow, flexible and crystalline cylinder at light speed through the universe...continuously rolling and sliding in impossibly complex patterns, such was my consciousness.  The meditation was intense and beautiful.
13	Later in the morning, we tried to eat at a restaurant.  My buckwheat pancakes were more interesting to look at then to eat.  They tasted like air, but were hard to swallow.  On the surface of each blue-violet circle I could see new worlds forming and dissipating.  I remembered reading about how it would look if you peered out of a black hole into which you were falling.  Before the event horizon, you would see galaxies' birth and death in firework-like speed and splendor.  E, being the old master that he is, ate my breakfast as well as his own.  After another hour or so of kickin it back home we all split up.  H and I showered together and then hit the bed.  E and B flew away for the time being.  In bed, we made love with pure and energetic spheres of radiance around us.  The soft one and I drifted off into a light sleep with surprisingly little resistance, exhausted and clean.
14	I awoke around 3pm with a start after a 4 hour nap.  The visuals were still very noticeable although nowhere near as intense as the peak hours of madness.  I had an overwhelming feeling of calm and purity to the point where I cried lightly a few times.  We just kicked it inside my lovely little apartment smoking high-grade herb and snacking on real foods to replenish ourselves.  E and B later came over to revel in the afterglory.  It taught all of us alot about ourselves and brought us even closer together as friends.  Throughout the previous night and forever afterward, we would ask E how many hits he actually put on our space treats.  With his mischievous smile he would reply 'just 2'.  Later he would ask us, 'just 2?', and then laugh his ass off.
15	I recommend taking smaller, known doses for the uninitiated.  For the experienced traveler...well, sometimes you just see where or when the path leads you.  Overall, it lasted for ~20hrs before totally leaving us, thus the day after was still very interesting.  That night of the ice storm is called 'lsd death night' by H and B, but E and I call it 'automatic ice'.  It took me to the edge of sanity for a long time.  I loved the person that I found there, and we emerged together with a profound love for life and the Earth.  The harmony of existence is infinite.  Here is something that made me cry the next day in light of the experience, I hope you enjoy it as I did:

17	The beginning of summer in 2000, memorial day weekend to be exact, I consciously left my body on journey of an alternative reality.  My setting was a music festival in California.  I thought I was injesting 10-20 hits of good liquid LSD.  I find out later I got a 'Chunk' in the last of the bottle.  A tiny little Crystal of LSD.
18	I really don't think I was in the appropriate setting for this type of extensive interfacing but there I was.  In the Moment.  Past Present and Future lined up into one and created a lattice work of moving eternity so I jumped on.  I went through many synchronicities lining up people in my life events coming into place.  At one point in the reality I was in I Birthed universes for the future or past or the infinte.  Time has a funny way of bending and contorting in this altered state.  
19	The birthing process brought me closer to oneness.  I had a hard time re-entering my body.  Everything turned to ones and zero's and negitive one like on the internet.  I actually felt like The planet had a big net over it and to re-enter I had to go through it.  Very unpleasent in a digital way.  The most interesting thing happened to me after this experience.  My eye color changed for three days.  I have green eyes and after this experience I had bright piercing electric blue eyes.  People around me were commenting as well as my boyfriend.
20	I have made an explanation to my self about this.  How scientifically sound it is I don't know.  I know lighter eyes let more light in them.  So on my journey I believe I interfaced so much with so much light(truth) that my eye color adapted to that frequency of learning on that level.  As far as set and setting, the universes I birthed there was me pissing my self here, I ended up hanging out with rock med.  I would not trade my experience for ANYTHING.  I also woundn't take such a high dosage of any thing in a festival setting with out someplace to go where you can let it all out if need be.  It is important to have acess to a space on this demension that can haddle your body mimicking what is going on in other demensions you may be traveling. I use this and all other alternative reality experiences every day to further the study of self. 
21	It is funny how one experience can impact you so intensely that it is still teaching you in a year.  This memorial day weekend I attended MINDSTATES2.

23	LSD (2) : Festival / Lg. Crowd (24), General (1)
24	This was about my seventh time Tripping on LSD. After doing many purple geltabs, which i found to be very powerful, and not tripping off the papertabs I've taken, i thought papers were useless. But I was wrong, I just hadn't found the right ones yet. That is until this weekend a month ago.  A friend of mine had a little house party in which 10-15 people come, drink, smoke some maryjane, and socialize. He throws these get-togethers often. Well.. I am 17 and was almost a full blown alcoholic, so I eased on it and got into LSD, MDMA, etc... So me, and 3 other friends decided to get some Acid, while everyone else drank. (Something we do quite often)
25	Me and JB road over to a friend of his, getting a total of 20 hits. (10 were for money-making purposes to pay for ours.) This was Jonathon's first time tripping. While at the dealer's house, he specifically said, 'I don't care how much you usually take, do NoT take more than two of these.' This means alot coming from him, a daily tripper.
26	Well, I'm not one to follow standards, so i took my 5. Derek took 2, and Jonathon took 1. We lost JB somewhere along the way. I went to a bedroom alone and turned on the strobe and some techno. Regular house shot mostly. I waited a half hour and just had that queezy feeling I always seem to get in my stomach before I trip. I was trying to make myself trip, by staring at things in the room hard, and zoning out(when will I learn to just sit and be patient). Well after that half hour i got up and went to the living room where everyone was watching 'body shots' a clubbin' flick. Although i didn't like this atmosphere of no music or pretty lighting effects, i layed on the floor and watched on.  Then the shit hit me so hard, I haven't ever felt like this before. For the first time in my life I got the thought for a split second, 'maybe I took a few too many'. But that thought disappeared within about a minute. Things in the house that usually only became visual for certain periods of time were constantly flowing and moving. The carpet was seemingly alive, and I found myself to be doing odd things. 
27	This Acid was so different to me, It gave me a very strong body trip and mental trip, along with more visuals than the other acid I've done.  My body was feeling very weak yet so amazingly tingly. Like a shiver, but constant.  The sky became a flat purple color, and trees were flat black and cartoony. I am not used to this, but I was enjoying myself. We ended up having to leave ( drunk people need sleep) around 2am.  Driving was so scary yet completely amazing. I've ridden while tripping before, but this seemed different. We landed at an abandoned trailer on a backroad right behind a wild animal park.  The sounds of peacocks were so odd to hear while tripping.  Then my vision became completely altered, I was seeing things in like a purple writing, but shaped the way they really were supposed to be. Like comparable to the writing in the film 'MATRIX'. I was stunned, and this made me and LSD a closer companion. The night went on till about 7:30am, which started at about 11pm. The outcome was, we lost Derek along the way, and it was me and Jonathon at a gas station about 45 miles away from home. We had the ridiculous idea to follow a semi on the interstate to see where he was going.  After it war off, I had no come down, or even a burned out feel. I was amazed, and because of this I love LSD more than ever. 
28	Ever since my first trip I had a different outlook on everything. Ever since this trip, I didn't have a comedown at all. So, I found a great companion.  Enjoy your LSD everyone, and please be safe. Driving is not a good idea and we shouldn't have done it. Thanks.

30	well, when i took my second trip, I did 5 hits while walking in the forest, and as i was coming up, and walking over a bridge, i drew the lsd molecule on the railing and wrote 'albert hofmann is my father' as a joke. i'm not gonna go into too much detail on the visuals, because they weren't too much different from last time, and i'm sure anyone who's done acid know about 'em already... mainly mandalas and and peoples faces moving around. I watched trainspotting with my sitter (he was somewhat concerned due to the disturbing imagery, but for some reason i've always found that movie to be kind of life affirming and good), but i couldn't really keep track of what was going on. while watching the movie a made a few realizations: 
31	The first was that evolution is a self anihilating concept, in that the species which becomes dominant inevitably destroys itself, allowing the process to start over again. 
32	The second, which i realized as i pet my dog and was overwhelmed
33	by the vast amount of pure, unconditional love pouring from him, was that we are all one being, experiencing itself for the sheer joy of it, which led me to the third revelation, that the point of life (or at least mine) is to be happy and to make others happy. which is why i can't stand those who disregard others feelings and only persue their own pleasure.
34	As my sitter left, we talked a little, and i was nearly brought to tears by his kindness in watching me, and allowing me to be myself. I now feel very lucky to have him as a friend, because he has never judged me and he's always supported me in all my decisions.
35	Later, I went to take a shower. I looked at my body and realized how ape like humans really are, and i realized that as much as we revel in our physical achievements, and our physical form, we are, as a people, ashamed of our simian heritage, although many of our postures are those of apes, and squatting on my feet, i could almost feel a tail extending from my spine...
36	overall, it was a very good day, and i hope to repeat the experience before too long, but those 5 hits were the last of the 10 that i got in october and i don't have any money at the moment, so i'll probably end up taking another 3 month stint of sobriety...

38	LSD (2) : General (1), Glowing Experiences (4), Various (28)
39	I recently had a chance to find myself switching roles in an experience I had had on LSD.  I had some younger friends over, who were relatively inexperienced on LSD.  Only two others were on LSD, the other three were just drinking for various reasons.  We had acquired the LSD from a reputable source that evening in liquid form dropped onto sugar cubes.  The two novices took a double dose there and then another an hour later after returning to my house, which I like to think of as a good chill space.  I took one double dose about the time they took their second.  I set up a series of music that I knew would be enjoyable and mind bending, particularly in the acid head space (Orbital, Banco de Gaia, etc).
40	The LSD was very clean and high quality.  It snuck up behind us slowly and then wacked us over the head, sucking our brains into the spirals that wouldn't stop for the rest of the evening.  When I felt mine come on, I just let myself go.  Being slightly off timing of the other two, I settled more into an observer state than trapped into their spirals (tho that would ensue later).  I found it quite humorous to see them trapped in the mindset that we (and they to each other) were 'fucking with them'.  It was funny to me because I remember one trip I had where, even being somewhat experienced on LSD, I felt like the people I was tripping with (whom I had only known through online communications) were messing with me and we were all messing with each other.  In that case as with this, it was never anything malicious or disturbing, but was well summarized in the quote 'Ok, who's fucking with me, is it you or me?'
41	It just made me realize that one shouldn't always try and define or explain the acid head space.  It often leaves one confused.  I enjoyed just observing and letting myself go.  Having come to many interesting understandings in Aikido recently about spirals, shapes, energy flow, and the like, I was able to fit these same thoughts and identify with the same concepts affecting the flow of the LSD space.  The ever elusive point (singularities are a bitch, always gotta remain on the tangent), circular thought patterns, infintite spirals (they're the same whether they are spinning in or out), movement of body, mind, and energy, etc.  It was difficult to explain or put them in a rigid framework, so I just let myself experience them as they came and manifest them in whatever form may be at the time, whether it was dance, thought, manipulation of others (like I said, there wasn't neccessarily any fucking with others, often it just seemed like it, but that doesnt mean it didn't happen, cause it's fun when you get it right), or Aikido shapes/forms.  
42	It was just interesting to see the same strugglings that I have been through, evidenced in these two, and to provide the chill space where one could just deal with it. I'm not trying to sound like an elitist bastard (albeit I am one), but I take the lessons from LSD to my heart, and they do help me integrate my reality and how I interact with it.  My presence of mind is greatly aided by a dissolution of self and the reconstruction of intent and structure. It was refreshing to see where I had come from, and where my mind and self have developed since then.  Not to say it's not possible for me to get caught in the same spirals, they're always there.  It was just fun to play the observer.

44	I've recently read about Trey's experience on mixing LSD with mescaline, something about his recollection struck me as to how similar it was to mine, only I had just taken LSD alone.  One afternoon myself and a close friend did some acid, and experienced the usual tale of warped images, however approx 6 hours later when I thought that the effects were begining to dissipate, I was astounded to see something which was amazing and uncontrollable - and ultimately emotionally stunning. No matter how much I tried to change my focus on to something else, the things I were seeing remained.  These things or thing, was in fact a jelly like sheen which coated my whole body, which I could only detect by sight (at first).  It looked like what I imagine a drop of milk would look like suspended in geletine, sort of forming a minute yet complex white misty cloud, it hovered about an inch above my skin (not my clothes)  As I began to explore this occurence more closely - by looking at my fingers, I saw fleeting electrical sparks, the smallest I have ever seen, these electrical sparks seemed to be thinner than the finest hair and lasting only a fraction of a fraction of a second.  
45	I later began to feel a strong electrical presence in the room (no sound) just a kind of what I would describe as a 'biological white noise' This white noise grew immense and loud - this is not auditory loud, it's more of a loud silence, maybe the opposite of sound?  anyway, I felt it engulf me and take me to the most euphoric place I have ever been, I sensed that this place was unlike the 3 dimensional life that I knew of, but more of a place where everying is purely emotional - purely thought - no mass no space.  Whilst in this place, I was convinced that the other presence formed part of me, and alway had been with me. Like Trey I felt that this presence was happy to know that I could finally acknowledge it.

47	It all started off innocently enough.  I was going to St. George, Utah, to pick up a friend and go to Vegas for a fun filled weekend of smoking weed, cruising the strip, and a Phish concert.  Prior to this trip I had never even considered taking acid.
48	Friday morning we left St. George and headed for Vegas.  We smoked some shwag on the way down the canyon and jammed to the Doors, and talked nonsense till we got to Vegas.  When we got to Vegas we met up with some mutual friends, one of which attends UNLV and lives in the dorms, which is where we slept.  Friday night everyone found tickets to the Phish show, so we all went and had an awsome time.
49	Saturday morning we woke up late and sat around reminiscing about how cool the concert was.  We all decided we would try to get tickets to the Saturday night show.  Then my friend D pulled out a little bottle and smiled at me.  He asked me if I wanted to do some acid.  It was a very interesting thought, I had never really considered it before.  I had only smoked pot about three times before this trip.  I asked everyone what it was like and about all I could gather from them was that it was 'crazy,' 'intense,' and that I would be a different person after.  I thought for about fifteen minutes and decided to go for it.  D put two drops from the little breath freshener bottle on my tounge.  I rubbed it around my mouth and swallowed.  'That's it?' I asked.  'Thats it,' D said.  The friend I drove down from St. George also took one hit.
50	I asked why no one else was doing it and they explained that you develop tolerance and they didn't want to have to do twice as much to get the same effect.  I had no idea the night before that they were all tripping.  At first I had the feeling that nothing was going to happen.  They just told me to hold on and it would work.  About a half hour after taking the acid, things started to happen.  The first effect I noticed was that a blue chair in the room seemed much more blue.  It was strange but not alarming.  Then I laughed my ass off as I watched my friend B roll a joint.  It was so funny that he had these finely tuned 'joint rolling skills.'   Then we set off on what would be the strangest journey of my life.
51	As we set off across the parking lot the sun was high and hot, about 1:00 in the afternoon.  I could sense things much better.  I could feel the heat from the pavement and the sun was brighter.
52	There was quite a while before the show, so we decided to just chill and walk around the parking lot amongst all the Phish heads.  We picked a nice grassy hill partialy in the shade and by a big 'friendly' rock.  This is when I started to peak.
53	I sat among my friends, on a small grassy hill, partly in the shade of my friend the pine tree, and by my friend the rock.  I looked around and the trees started to dance and the grass seemed to flow like a gently, peacefully, rolling stream.  All the people relaxing around me were very beautiful.  It was one of the happiest moments I've ever had.  Everyone and everything were happy to be there sharing in each others' company.
54	Someone suggested that we go exploring and I was happy with doing anything.  We walked around all the campers and busses and did some people watching.  It was a very surreal experience.  Walking around thinking crazy stuff, all the dealers wispering 'acid, shrooms, extacy' at us.  Then it happened:  I was lost.  Four hundred miles from home, tripping balls, and I was lost.  I tried to stay calm and was fairly successful.  I just remembered I was on drugs and they would go away sooner or later.  Finally I found my friends without incident and we went back and chilled on the grass which was very relieving.  We didn't find tickets to the show but I was content for I had had my own little 'show.'
55	I think I will definitely do acid again some time.  It is quite an experience, but do some research before you try it.

57	LSD (2) : Festival / Lg. Crowd (24), First Times (2), General (1)
58	I was not at all an experienced drug user. It was my freshman year in high school and I had been smoking weed for approximately 2 years and I drank, but that's as far as my drug use went. Well, I had been wanting to try harder and better things for a while and then my friend gave me 2 geltabs (I cannot recall what kind, but someone I know who has tripped over 120 times told me it was very strong!). Well, it was after school and I was alone so I decided not to take it.
59	The next day in school I realized I still had the 2 tabs on me. I was really bored and it was right after 2nd period, 10 am. I told my druggie friend what I had and she told me to take it. I thought it sounded like a good idea since I figured she could take care of me if something went really wrong, and I was really bored. Well, I popped both in my mouth. Not much later, I started feeling crazy and out of control. Everything looked really funny. They took me to the locker room in the gym and I sat there and started bugging out. They knew it was a bad idea for me to go to class, so I just sat there. I started seeing all sorts of crazy things, even though none of it was there. I was really scared and I realized I was fucked up badly. The teacher came in to yell that we couldn't just sit there, we had to go to class. I saw monkeys dancing around and a dog on the floor. 
60	My friends realized that if an official saw me they would know I was fucked up. They tried to take me out of the locker room but I was too busy crying that the dog couldn't come with us. They picked me up and dragged me out of there. They decided to bring me to lunch where I could sit and relax. But the walls in my school were really curvy and there are like a million turns. I kept feeling as though the walls were going to get me and hit me. Then I finally got to the stairs and they totally bugged me out. I refused to walk and began to crawl up the stairs. Then they heard the dean start to come to scream for us to get out of the hallways and into class. They knew they couldn't have the dean see me crawling up the stairs so they brought me to the bathroom. I started bugging out in there. 
61	They decided to bring me to my bio lab class and I could sit there because the teacher already knew me and my friends were druggies, so we knew he wouldn't care. I sat at my table just staring at it, thinking there were all sorts of colors even though it was white. The teacher just ignored me. Then I got real hot and went to the window. I was so hot I stuck my whole body out the window and almost fell out. Then the dean came into my class and said they had to speak to me. I was so scared. I left the room and said I wanted my friend that was with me in class to come with me. So they said she could come. They brought me to the bathroom and started questioning why I looked so funny. I said I had been sick and vomited and also had an asthma attack. They said ok, they were going to go get the nurse and to stay there. 
62	Now, I wasn't really seing crazy things as much, but I was so scared and nervous and paranoid they would figure out what was wrong. My friend kept trying to calm me down but I just started crying and couldn't stop. Then the nurse and the dean came back and they were like, what's the matter, are you okay? Why are you shaking so much? I said I just didn't feel well and that after my asthma attacks I start to shake because I get myself so worked up and scared, and that I would be fine and I wanted to go back to class. They said no and took me downstairs. They said my friend had to go to class, though. I really didn't want her to leave and started crying again. They took me to the office and made me call my mom. 
63	I told her I just hadn't felt well and I would be fine and she was like, you want me to come pick you up and bring you to the doctor? I was like nooo, because I knew a doctor would figure it out. Well, to make this very long story end, they let me go and suggested to my mom that I get drug tested. After that I was fine and felt better the rest of the day. I learned a lot from that day. I put myself in a bad situation. You should not do something where there is a chance you can get in trouble around a lot of officials and school is not a place for drugs. 
64	If you want to try something or do drugs, don't do them in school. Also, I should have learned more about the drug and the effects and I should have been more prepared for what could happen. I have since done acid again many times and have now done many other drugs as well. I have never again had a bad trip or any other experiences or problems like that and have never come so close to being caught again. That was the worst experience of my life and it taught me a lot of life lessons. It prepared me really well for the drugs I have done since then.

66	LSD (2) : Large Group (10+) (19), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
67	Hi, my name is R, I'm 20 years old and I'm not of English origin so I apologise in advance for any typos or misspelling.
68	I practice yoga and meditation every once in a while, I belive I am in good physical condition and I eat well, I have experience with MDMA, cocaine, ketamine, speed paste, LSD, mushrooms ;), and some research cuemicals that were sold as MDMA and LSD although I don't do coke any more nor will I for the rest of my life as I realised it's absolute crap and I don't really get what I'm paying for and yes I've had good coke.
69	It all started at 1:45am when I was waiting to get picked up to go to a psychedelic trance rave some kms away from my house. As I wait I stretch for a bit. I get picked up and driven to the place, none of the other people in the car went with be but they had some acid and I had some money so I bought 5 hits. I drop one as soon as we arrive there which was at about 2:15am. As I pay my entry and observe what's going on, I go upstairs to the balcony and immediately run into an aquaintance of mine and I give her a big hug and spin her around ahahah it felt great.  
70	At this point I was starting to heavily come up. The acid I was doing were Hoffman's, they have been advertised as 300mcg but I've done good LSD and from personal experience I know it's not the case but nevertheless they are good, the only downside to these Hoffman's are that they don't produce much visuals but the high is great! (The tabs had no taste whatsoever).
71	I start running into my friends and since I didn't have any weed on me I asked them to roll us a joint, which they did, they even let me roll it, at this point I was already tingling and in the mood to dance so we smoke the joint and go back downstairs. The music is great. I danced the night away and in-between 2am and 6am I dropped 3.5 tabs and gave the rest to my friends. in-between 2am and 6am I dropped 3.5 tabs and gave the rest to my friends. Almost everyone in that party was either on MDMA or acid and the music was great.
72	The only visuals I got during the party was when I was looking at the screen and it had strips of red and blue and green triangles Wich made this trippy cornucopia and kept changing between the two I saw the triangles overlapping the red stripes and when it switched back to the triangles they were in hd and the colour was very vivid. When we left the party we went to smoke some joints at this place that was sheltered from the wind and cold, this happened during November in southern Europe so it was cold but not so cold. After daylight breaks we leave to go to the gas station that was about 2 or 3kms away.
73	Some wierd stuff happend during the process of all that. One of my friends had a bike and I rode it every now and then during the walk to the station and every time I did I started seeing patterns on the ground but not your usual ones like geometric shapes, oh no. These patterns were telling some kind of story that I really didn't understand but ok.  
74	I got home at about 11am, took a shower and went to sleep. I slept for about 3h give or take.
75	When I woke up I had breakfast  and rolled myself a spliff and went to the local park. I smoked a cigarret first, which felt and tasted better than usual then the joint. As I came up from the weed I got a bit of the acid high back and just enjoyed it. At 6:30am I went to church with my family and had a really good experience. At 6:30am I went to church with my family and had a really good experience. I have done this once before on 1g if mushrooms and had an amazing experience. I believe in Jesus tough I am not Catholic. My church has no saints or any images we just sing and praise the Lord almighty. 
76	When I got back home I ate  smoked my other joint and went to bed early at about 10pm, read a chapter of the Bible and went to sleep. I woke up about 15 hours later feeling kinda tired but very relaxed and in a positive mood. I am currently writing this at about 5:30pm on a Sunday.

78	LSD (2) : Rave / Dance Event (18), General (1)
79	After reading all these experiences it made me want to share one of the many experiences I had with LSD or acid as we called it.  I have to say that I was lucky and always stayed within the limits of reasonable dosage when using acid.  This fact is probably the reason why my usage of acid had a rather positive effect on my life.  
80	It was summer, I was about 15 or 16 at the time.  Me and my buddy Francis have already done acid a few times before.  In other words it was one of the first times I tripped on this.  I came to his house around 5 or 6 PM.  He already had the acid and was ready to drop it.  So we did.  
81	After half an hour or so I started feeling queasy an anxious.  A little time after that I started to laugh like crazy for no apparent reasons; basically I just looked at my buddies face (and he was so stoned!) and started to laugh and laugh...it was really funny.  After this insane laughing trip I started looking at some books and thats when the visuals kicked in.  It made no sense.  The letters were moving back and forth fucking up my perception.  At one point I thought I was reading thoughts from my unconscious. At one point I thought I was reading thoughts from my unconscious.  I was amazed by this feeling...overwhelmed I would say.  I felt like a... Recipient of ice cream, and I could dig inside myself, digging out secrets I didn't know of but were there after all.  After putting the book down I started to see things which made me ecstatic.  I had visions of big city landscapes.  I could see it clearly; buildings and skyscrapers in front of me in a distance.  And this is kinda funny 'cause a couple of years later I moved out in the big city...kinda strange.  
82	After a few hours my buddy got tired of me and kicked me out.  So I called up my dad and he came and picked me up.  The ride home was hell: my father was casually talking to me as I was seeing the street lights growing bigger and bigger.  Everything was kinda yellowish and the light poles were deformed.  I also had the feeling that the car was going very slowly but it as rolling at a normal pace.  
83	Finally when I came home my dad went to bed but I was still wide awake.  The rest of the trip was in my room.  At first the ceiling fan made me trip for awhile.  Then colors in the ceiling started to appear.  But the thing that made me trip the most is when I passed in front of the mirror.  I stopped and looked at my face only to realize it wasn't my face!  And it was constantly changing. Faces of people I never seen before appeared in the mirror Faces of people I never seen before appeared in the mirror with a kaleidoscope effect.  Then my face morphed and melted.  
84	When I think about this trip and any other acid trip I made in my life; it always made me realize something about myself or our beautiful mother earth or the universe.  This particular trip made me see I had a changing personality.  Which is true.  As I grow older I can't help but realize that I am an unstable human being constantly changing and evolving...Anyways every trip was a revelation.  I love it and I can't wait the proper moment to do it again!

86	I took notes during a recent LSD trip. This is the transcript. 
87	5:00 p.m. Take half a tab, instant light high.
88	5:20 p.m. Everything is visually sharper and more vibrant than usual, some floating neon patches of color.
89	5:45 p.m. Colors even more vibrant, heart racing, warm feeling in chest. 
90	6:15 p.m. The effects seem to be getting stronger with each mood boost that comes over me The effects seem to be getting stronger with each mood boost that comes over me (the strengthening in intensity definately seems to be caused by the mood boosts, not the other way around). I choose to go outside.
91	6:50 p.m. After locking myself out of house, come back and peak 
92	6:57 p.m. No longer doubt if 'it's working.' I'm riding my bike and it feels like the pedals are getting taller and shorter, very intense.
93	8:08 p.m. Yep, everything makes sense now, I'm sitting on a bench by the river listening go the JCS soundtrack and smoking a cig and I feel so good, everything is perfect. 
94	9:40 p.m. Vivid patterns in the darkness, lose some sense of spatial reality (dreamlike) 
95	9:44 p.m. Grasp the magnitude and power of the Willamette river for the first time ever on the Autzen footbridge.
96	12:21 a.m. Don't try to communicate with non living beings, success would result in a complete psychotic break. 
97	1:43 p.m. Haven't slept, still having tactile hallucinations (things I'm wearing or touching melting into me) the visuals are mostly subtle.
98	2:57 p.m. I swear the objects are creaking more than usual. 
99	3:01 p.m. It feels like most everyone else is just saying 'come on, get on with it' when it comes to collective consciousness, but only for fleeting moments. Everything has been synced up all night Everything has been synced up all night (my thought patterns with the noises coming from the inanimate objects, as if to punctuate the thoughts) it makes some of what I'm thinking seem very meaningful. Reinforces my belief that psychedelics activate some sort of extra sensory perception, or that taking them encourages other forms of consciousness to attempt contact. 
100	"[Reported Dose: ""1/2 tab, very STRONG stuff really soaked it good""]"
101	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
102	Took two doses about 5:30 p.m. on the familiar 'ride up' I knew this liquid was going to be very potent. 
103	My buddy turned on some Grateful Dead and I was comforted by the familiar sounds. M put that music on at just the right point because just as I was starting to peak the music turned into an orchestra of twisting clocks. My eyes were closed and this shift in music made me very uncomfortable.  My mind was reeling in on itself to an almost unbearable pitch. 
104	Just when I felt like I might scream uncontrollably everything cleared away effortlessly.  My body-mind became light and buoyant. I felt a peace like no other wash over me softly, and as it did the top of my head opened like a lotus. I felt a peace like no other wash over me softly, and as it did the top of my head opened like a lotus. This was a very odd feeling looking back, but at the moment it felt perfectly natural. My spirit or energy or consciousness or whatever float  upwards out of my body into space. I felt at total peace gazing out at the stars and all of creation. 
105	Then out of the inky blackness a small point of something appeared. This small point grew out symmetrically into these beautiful delicate hands that seemed to have a rainbow aura. More hands radiated outwards some were open with beautiful strange eyes looking at me some held things some held many things like somehow multiple things could fill one space. Outward until a full image of a magnificent being of golden light with many arms and hands appeared.  
106	This was more than a bit scary to me. It was simply too much to behold. I opened my eyes and I was almost completely sober!

109	11:11pm Make a wish. Dropped the tab [1 acid tab ungrateful dead]. 
110	11:47 pm I thought I wasnt feeling anything but my neck feels odd. I almost feel very lightly nauseous but I know it will pass I think its because I didnt eat much before only pizza about 5 hours ago. My hand eye coordination is staring to lag as noticed from typing on the computer and talking to a friend. 
111	11:58 pm Pupils larger. Feeling weirder. Starting 2 trip.
112	12:17 am Done texting. Time to let go. Hard to type. I just feel weird. Everything is on a slant.
113	12:19 am Hearing and seeing trails if that makes sense. Hyper aware. Slipping further into it. Pupils dilated. I cant tell if I have to pee or not lol.
114	12:29 am Woahh its only been 10 minutes lol. Im deff tripping now. Grinding my teeth a lot. 
115	12:43 am Staring the movie Waking Life. Tired of electronics. 12:43 am Staring the movie Waking Life. Tired of electronics. 
116	2:38 am Waking Life was intense. Really hungry I wish I could sort that. Im surprised I can type. Everything is moving in little circles. Trying to play Grand Theft Auto now. Really super sensitive to all the ambient music this thing makes. Everything is melting like in Waking Life loll. 
117	4:06 am Starting to come down. Pupils still very large. 
118	4:46 am Still grinding teeth, ears still keen on music and my Dream Sequens' by NMESH cassettes. I wish it wasnt almost 5am. I have to remind myself I can get it again. Watching Prevue Guide clips and smoking weed. 
119	5:52 am Staring into the mirror I somehow became third person. For a second my audio and visual seemed completely static I became the reflection somehow I became the moment I saw the reflection of myself in the mirror and I became the reflection staring back for a second.
120	I did some more dabs and peacefully drifted off to sleep around 7am or so.

122	 O.K., Been tripping for five years on cid and shrooms, lots of shrooms.This particular experience, happened to be the strongest dose ever.Myself and seven other people, all close freinds, had gathered together for a trip session. A very special occasion since we never get to see each other.A week before, me and three of the others had got the acid and we sampled it. I took one and then another after I had peaked.The best trip that I had ever encountered.Smooth, clean the greatest visuals.Just the three of us on the fourth of july watching the fire works explode in to cosmic angels, chillin with my gal, and haveing revolations beyond my normal symbolic mindscape.Great I thought.The second trip, with all seven of us, had started out different.I thought , hey what the hell, I handled the last one like a pro, why not toss back three or four.No big deal.A few of the others had taken large doses as well.I can feel the first vibes run up and down my body about twenty minutes later.We all were sitting in the living room of the small two bedroom apt.I could barely understand what anyone was saying, I could here their voices but their lips did not move at all.We all experienced this same thing, as we discussed this later.
123	I remember I was afraid that they were against me for some reason and I was afraid to say anything for fear that it might be true.I must have been quiet for an hour into the trip before I got the nerve to pull one of my best friends to another room and make sure that I wasnt insane.I had been trapped in my own fear and insecurities for a long time.What felt like an eternity.I was relieved to find that I was not the only person that was experiencing this.I went outside on the porch to breath the fresh air and get a grip on myself.Soon as I got out there I snapped out of it.I Went back in to discover that my cousin was running around the house swithing the lights on and off saying, Im Jeremy Im going to bed.This would of been fine if he had of stopped.He was stuck in a loop.Thats all he could do, he said the same things over and over again, and could not sit down, as if he could not figure out what he should be doing.LSD unlocks you from the dreadful repititions of boring habitual tendencies,that seem to consume our lives.He wasnt ready.Finally he was convinced to take an enormous bong hit and that did the trick. He snapped right out of it.We all had a giant learning experience that night.First, know what your taking,how strong it is and there is no need for taking more than is necessary.Two, plan out your trips.LSD is not for shits and giggles.
124	It can be negative in a negative environment.LSD is a tool for evolution, and can be used effectively as such. Planning a session, taking the time to do it right is important. We were in a crowded room, we couldnt be loud , we were in an apt.The first time I tripped on this cid it was only the three of us and we were comfortable there. With seven people in a small room , not enough things to occupy us.Ive tripped hard as hell at parties where I almost lost it because of unfamiliar faces and uncomfortable surroundings.Bad tripps are not the effect of the drug, but the effect of the surroundings.

127	Well, this trip started with none other than the overwhelming happiness that always ceases to amaze.
128	I dropped 1.5 tabs at about 4 in the afternoon, turned on Bebop, and I chilled
129	About an hour in I start smiling, this lasts the whole trip.
130	Another hour passes, I walk upstairs, which I love doing because  it involves most of the 5 senses (including my new sixth sense)
131	This 'sixth sense' I refer to is the sense that converts normal senses into other senses.
132	For example sound and touch blended into sight.
133	A kalaidescope of color with the consistency of water flooded my vision.
134	With every new touch, sound, smell, this trip was increased
135	The third of these four hours was most intense.
136	As I looked to the walls of my house while moving through it, I noticed a nob in the cherry-wood that actually morphed into none other than a full-blown skull.
137	This skull started laughing as I grew more and more perplexed with visual.
138	I then start laughing with it (as the body buzz is intense and makes me feel happy no matter what I do)
139	Then, a patchwork of demon-heads, all about the size of a fifty-cent piece formed around the skull and laughed in unison at me.
140	I then went upstairs and decided to come down while talking to my friends.
141	In the last thirty minutes of my extra sense, the watery colors faded and my hands began rapidly changing colors(beleive it or not thats less of a trip than before)
142	Anyway about ten minutes after that my pupils went back to normal and trippiness was over.
143	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
144	Ten strip of really clean, good strong acid.  The best I've ever had. Well this trip went on for a long time, and a lot happened.  But to me, the most interesting part, the most moving part, is described below.
145	I am flying over the ocean.  Not really in a body, just looking down at the ocean from high above.  There's a ship down there.  I'm not really paying attention, not too concerned with whatever is happening.  Somehow, I know that this is the Pacific Theater of World War II.  Somewhere near Japan or the Phillipines. Somehow, I become aware that I am a man on the ship.  There is a violent explosion in which I am killed.  It is very disturbing, I look away, horrified.  It's terrible, terrible.  My body is ripped apart.  It's awful.  I turn away. I'm up in the sky looking down.
146	Now I am in a dark underground cave.  There are many people here.  We are all dead.  A huge crowd of dead people, standing around, frowning. It feels sketchy here.  Not like we are in Hell, but this is not a nice place.  I think, 'This is Sheol.'  It's like a waiting room.  I want to leave. It's like a waiting room.  I want to leave.   But you're not allowed to.  There are these monsters guarding us.  They look like big disembodied mouths, with snaggly teeth, drooling slime and blood, hovering above the ground.
147	I go right up to one and assert, 'Angels are real!  Angels exist!'  I don't know why I said this.  I was not raised religious and did not believe in such things. It says something to me in an aside, like it doesn't want anyone else to hear, 'Well I don't doubt it.'  And then it stands aside and lets me walk out of there.
148	Now I am floating, ascending upwards through many red and gold spinning pentagrams. I pop out in a vast open space.  There is bright light everywhere, so I can hardly see anything.  I feel like everything is totally peachy.  I feel great, not scared at all.  This is a wonderful place.  If I was a Christian I would definitely say I was visiting heaven.
149	There are creatures here.  There are no other human beings, as far as I can tell.  The creatures are enormous, the size of a two-storey house.  It's hard to tell what they look like, because their flesh is like looking at the sun.  They best I can describe is that it was like an enormous lion with wings, but that's not really what it is.  It had eyes.  I saw its eyes.  There was more than one of the creatures. They were very benevolent.  They said something to me, to the effect of, 'You can stay here with us forever, if you like.  But we want you to go back.  We want you to reincarnate.  But you don't have to.'  
150	I remember clearly, thinking, 'Ha!  You'd really have to have a screw loose to agree to do that!'  It felt so good to be there, I would never want to leave.  And I certainly wouldn't go back to being a human on Earth!  All the fear, confusion and suffering.  I'd have to literally be insane to agree to go back there.
151	And then *click* all of a sudden I was me again, back in my room, sober. And then *click* all of a sudden I was me again, back in my room, sober.  Guess I agreed.
152	I was curious about what that ship was, and asked about it later when I was tripping.  I saw a man wearing one of those caps that veterans wear, it was blue and it said 'USS ----------'.  I looked it up and sure enough, the USS ---------- was a ship in the Pacific Theater in WWII.  In the early 1940s there was an explosion in which men were killed.  Strangely enough, it happened on my birthday...
153	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
154	I was a High School Freshman boy and was very naive and intruged at all the stuff High School had to offer. I thought High School would be boring since I was only a Freshman and not very popular, but people at this school were very nice and friendly, so getting into crazy stuff was pretty easy.
155	I had an older friend Ill call X. I gotta thank X. He would pretty much do anything for me and this other dorky Freshman and expect nothing in return. One time, me and X were and this other kid were playing Watch Dogs pretty high on weed. We were playing the digital trip and I asked X if we could do Hallucinagens sometime. He said sure, and next weekend he had LSD for us both. 
156	The first stage is the giggles. Everything seemed funny, and I notice the slight effect of my friend moving faster. While giggling hysterically I smushed my face in a pillow. When I looked up from the pillow... It happened. Just like that I was tripping balls. The high is hard to explain. But it is very intense. So intense that it may have even been a bigger part of the trip than the hallucinations. The best way to describe it is that I feel this disoriented, depressed, euphoric, overwhelming, dreamlike, meaty, and spiritually mysterious feeling. That doesn't really give it full justice. I can't really describe it.
157	A lot happened, so I will just give you the most interesting details in no particular order. I very interesting experience was star gazing. Lines formed between the stars forming constellations. But the were not any constellations. They were 3-D. To add even more complexity, they were not actually 3-D, but were made of 2-D lines that gave a sense of depth, like when you draw a cube. To extenuate this perspective effect, the stars were different sizes, so that the bigger ones would be were they would be closer tho the viewer if the shape was 3-D. Another interesting effect was an invisible buffolo on a monocolor TV screen. If you think about it, an infinite variety of shapes make up any shape, because any shape can be cut out of any shape. Well I saw the silhouette of an invisible buffolo on this surface. It was not a different color than the rest of the surface or separated with a line. The screen was still monocolor, but I just saw where the buffolo would be.
158	As well as the visual hallucinations, I also had situational hallucinations. Keep in mind, that hallucinations are not dillusions. You can tell hallucination from reality. But I had a hallucination that X was my dad. I knew he wasn't, and he had no characteristics of my dad that could be detected by the five senses. It more just felt like this whole thing was a dad/son adventure. Music was also very odd. After every lick, it would end out of tune. But even though it was not in tune from a conventional standpoint, it sounded very good in its own unique way.
159	Another amazing thing was that I could not tie my shoes. I knew how to tie them. I was physically able to. I wanted to. I had the willpower, but something was missing. This was so interesting cause it made me consider that there may be many more parts of our brain involved in even mundane tasks that we are not aware of. And I only became aware of one of these parts when it was turned off. I heard there can be much worse side effects, but fortunately the only side effect I had was feeling extremely stuffy. Thankfully we had a bucket of water right by our side, but it mentally felt like I was covered in way to many blankets. That is not a metaphor. It was the physical equivalent of that, but in my brain. But other than that small discomfort, it was pretty fun.

162	I had recently purchased 1 trip of liquid acid from my friend. I had always wanted to trip on acid. I bought 1 trip and 3.5 grams of hydro weed. So, I rolled the weed into 2 blunts. I smoked one with my friend. He left shortly after so I dropped the acid.
163	About 45 minuted later I was tripping. It was night time and my and my friend left the woods and the leaves and trees gave off a metallic glow. Then I felt psychic. My friends were at a school sitting down when I called them. I said 'the cops will come meet me at arrowhead park' after that I had a vision where police dogs arrested all of them and I was there getting maced. So I sat down at the park and meditated. I saw lots of closed eye visuals including a green 'W' which was everywhere.
164	Then people started shooting off fireworks and I got scared and ran away. After that I had psychic visions of God,Moses, and all religious dietes telling me that I was the chosen one and to lead the enslaves people to The Sea of Tides. I was also felling very happy, the greatest I have ever felt. I smoked my second blunt and thats where the colored trails set in. The were everywhere. Then I started spacing out and I saw a glowing larve come out of a door with a huge eye in the middle. The eye was telling me to join forces with it in the battle against evil. It was weird but also cool.
165	I went home and started playing 'spyro The Dragon' for PS1. The dragon was flying out of the tv and around the room. Then I started to come down about 4.5 hours later. Aparently it wasn't the best acid but it was all I could get ahold of. This was by far the greatest experience of my life.

168	I was 22. Had just moved in with my boyfriend into a building that was being gentrified from a former crack house to the standard yuppie apartments (we had bullet holes in one window). As the renovations were ongoing for our time there it was rarely quiet and often workers walked in and out of our residence unannounced. But the day previous they stated they all had Sunday off, so that was when we decided to do our acid.
169	Unfortunately my mind set was much as it is now and always has been. Depressed, anxious, paranoid, and pessimistic. I try to keep all that at bay and enjoy my life, but its difficult. So that Sunday morning with a freshly neat and cleaned apartment my boyfriend gave me two and half little pieces of paper. I put them in my mouth and left them for half an hour. He did the same.
170	At first it was nice. It was sunny out. A warm late spring day in the midwest. Sun was streaming through the windows. I was with the man I loved and would eventually marry. I felt nice and cozy. The cat was on my lap purring. Just laying there purring. I wasn't even petting her. We decided to paint. Make some music. Draw some. Just do as we pleased.
171	I honestly have no recollection of how it happened, but I found myself naked as the day as I was born and just laying on our bed. I was perfectly content to stare at the textures of the ceiling. Then someone knocked on the door. It seemed impossibly loud. My boyfriend hurriedly put his pants back and on and went to the door. The workers decided to try and get some time and a half pay. They were working Sunday.
172	I heard all this while cowering naked in the closet and desperately clutching my confused cat for comfort. My man came back and tried to calm me down. It did not work.
173	We returned to the bed (I had replaced my clothing), the cat sticking by my side for some reason, and tried to again find the calm comfy place we were. I couldn't find it. I could hear everything at once. Screaming children, running faucets, footsteps, conversations, the pipes being worked on downstairs and it all came from everywhere and nowhere. It was horrible. I started to cry. I thought of the sharks sticker in the bathroom, the bullet holes in the window, the phantom image of a toddler running by it I had experienced much earlier and while not all drug impaired. I decided then that he had been shot to death and cried even harder.
174	The cat nuzzled my face and emitted a worried little meow in my direction. This for some reason struck me as hilarious. I then proceeded to laugh hysterically for approximately 15 minutes. 
175	At the site of my mate's worried face I then flipped into sobbing mode for a few minutes. Eventually the groaning, whining, screeching, and banging caused from the plumbing work below began to disturb him as well. It sounded like it was in our bathroom. The footsteps seemed to be in our hall. We looked but no one was there.
176	We relocated ourselves to the front room and sat in front of the big windows and just basked in the sun for awhile. I was feeling pretty good. Then I heard a woman scream. Heard a kid being smacked. Heard a baby cry. I looked out and saw the beautiful tall old trees, taller than our building, and thought of all the horrible human mess below. I then proceeded to cry non-step for more than half an hour.
177	We tried listening to music. It sounded like the musician was standing next to me, singing the words directly into my ear. I could not stand the sensation. We shut it off.
178	Somehow I gave in to my man's request for sexual intercourse. I found myself naked on the bed again. I felt like I was going to sink into the mattress like someone sinks into quicksand and I assumed I would be suffocated. It took an intense effort to keep myself sane enough to recongnize the fear as completely insane. Then he was doing what guy's do and I was enduring it. I usually love it. I felt like my limbs were shrinking. Like rapidly deflating balloons and that my skull was collapsing. I thought he was going to meld with me like two plastic pieces being melted and stuck together forever. I felt like my limbs were shrinking. Like rapidly deflating balloons and that my skull was collapsing. I thought he was going to meld with me like two plastic pieces being melted and stuck together forever. We'd be like siamese twins conected at the genitals. I focused on staying calm. I heard footsteps, but disregarded them. I heard a man laugh. A man say, 'There indisposed.' Then a door close. I still do not know whether or not a worker walked in and witnessed or drugged copulation or if it was a hallucination.
179	For the remainder of the trip we retreated to a newly empty room of the house. My man's schizo brother had moved back in with his mommy and taken his stuff with him. The large empty minimalist space soothed my mind and my racing heart. We sat on the floor and just stared at each other. Waiting out the unpleasantness. We seemed to read each other's mind. I leaned on the window while he went to use the toilet and was horrified at how I actually did want to do the cliche. I felt my body wanting to toss itself out the window and I fought with my hands to not open it and help me through. It was no death wish. There was a crack dealer standing below. It ocurred to me that it would be hilarious for a drugged chick to land on him and smash him.
180	Fianlly, after 9 horrible hours the trip ended. I had never felt my depression, paranoia, and anxiety at a more intense level than when I was on LSD. I'm 26 now and still have never taken it again. And I never will.

182	LSD (2) : General (1), First Times (2), Bad Trips (6), Sex Discussion (14), Depression (15), Small Group (2-9) (17)
183	I'd like to talk about my first, and thusfar only LSD trip. To set the mood, I'll say that this was at college, on my birthday (a bit more than a week away from the end of school), we were still living in dorms, I had only just the week prior heard that we might have access to LSD, and I was the only one of my friends brave enough to try it (everyone was worried about flashbacks, but the research I did suggested that they really wouldn't be too bad, if at all). We're a strong group of friends, tightly knit. These were the guys that introduced me to weed, etc. My first true friends, due to my awful experiences in high school.
184	Anyway, I awaken for my birthday, the tab already stored away in my fridge, I picked up my brand new grinder from the post office, I check through my mail, and I've gotten an email from a Google recruiter (quick opportunity to call my mom so I don't have to ignore her all day). Oh yeah, and it was an absolutely GORGEOUS day - high of 62*F, sunny (so it was absolutely comfortable to be out in pants and a t-shirt), this was looking good. I emptied my pockets of all but my wallet and keys, and popped the tab in my mouth at 12:00 noon. (so that t+1 would be 1:00, etc.). I chilled on my couch with a few of my friends waiting around for the inevitable, all while wondering if I had just eaten a piece of paper...
185	Fast forward to about 1:00. Still haven't felt any effects, although I obviously didn't know what I was looking for exactly. Until the shadow behind the towel on the wall started to shift and colorcycle just slightly. It wasn't much, but I knew I was in for a ride. At that point, I only had fairly vague visuals (things colorcycled, but only within a small range of colors), and I could feel my mind starting to run in interesting ways fairly quickly (Two good quotes from me: 'I was going to ask you what color the poster was, but then I realized your answer could not be satisfying to me.' and 'How come words don't look like words upside down, they look like upside down words?'). I enjoyed staring at the walls for a bit, but then decided to start my adventure.
186	First stop, my friend who lived across the hall from me. She showed me that IBM video explaining logarithms - basically it's a shot of zooming way out on a couple enjoying a picnic, all the way to the universe scale, then zooming way in to the subatomic scale. That absolutely captured me, and did color a lot of my thoughts throughout the day. A few other videos weren't as appealing, and we all decided it would be a good time to go outside.
187	It's me and three of my friends, we make it out of the door of the dorm, and we run into our RA in short order. I crack up, thinking about how she has no idea what's going on inside my head. We run a little later into more RA's doing an area program involving, as far as I recall, watersports and freezepops - neither of which interested me at the time. One of my friends goes off to get a freeze pop, and I think at that point had to go to class, so goes off towards academic side while the rest of us head off through the woods. I should mention, that in my mind, it's absolutely amazing looking at all the people around, thinking about what they're thinking, thinking about how visible I am to myself, and how basically invisible I am to everyone else, and being put into a damn good mood by everyone talking about how they were basically done with classes for the year.
188	We head off to the woods, and I don't know whether it's because of the LSD, or the weather, but it seems to me like everything is just a hell of a lot more GREEN in there. Everything was growing in, and I really hadn't noticed until then. Plus, although I wasn't feeling much in terms of visuals, all the green that was there was definitely a lot more vibrant a green than I had ever seen before. We take a walk through the woods (often used by stoners, by the way). I notice how damn big one of the robins is. I'm distracted by the movement of just about everything in the forest. We go over to one of the more popular spots in the woods, 'Narnia', which we hadn't been to since I got caught with a bong between my legs about a month back. We had nothing on us, so nothing to worry about. I run through those events a little bit, although in a totally great mood. We also run through the time we met up with a schizophrenic girl back there, and we figured out which tree she jumped out of. A bit more nature enjoyment, and we're off - we keep walking and we catch up with the road around campus to get back to the dorms. Here's where a bit of auditory tripping comes out.
189	Up to that point, everything had been fairly moderate - probably a +. When the auditory trip kicked in, I'd say it went up to a ++. I all of a sudden stopped walking - all of my mind was just as 'there' as it had been all day, but I noticed something funny. I could just barely hear the cars driving right next to me, but the sounds of the forest, the wind blowing through the trees, the birds chirping, etc. all were intensely loud. I started losing my ability to think like normal, and started thinking in 'LSD mode' (which I'll explain a bit later), and came up with some funny idea about how important nature was, and how unimportant the real world was... an idea it was almost impossible to put into words. After a little bit, we keep walking, and we head right back up to my dorm.
190	Physically, at that point, I was red and overheating, people commented that it looked like I had gotten a bit too much sun, but after resting a bit, sweating it off, and keeping with my liquid intake like I had been so careful to do all day, I went back to normal. I should stress this - I was VERY glad to have a ton of those 23oz green tea cans around - I went through alll of the ones I had left, and that was good. Just keep drinking.
191	Back in the dorm, we met up with a few more friends who had been in class up to that point, talked for a bit, and such. My concept of time is a bit fuzzy, but my guess would be that this was around 2-3pm.
192	Basically, chilling at this point involved my sitting on my couch, mostly thinking, occasionally talking with people, and my friend who was watching me playing a videogame in my room, while playing music on my stereo. I don't know how much time passed around then - it feels like a lot, but at the same time, I can't remember enough events around there to justify it being a lot - that's a common theme, asking my internal clock about what time it was, and my internal clock responding three different answers at the same time depending on how it figured it - one was way slow, one was dead on, and one was way fast, although I had no trust that any one of them was correct. 
193	At that point, I'd classify my baseline as ++. I was getting used to my thoughts shooting off, etc. I still held myself fairly grounded, though. It was then that I determined that I wanted to try to let that go a little. Basically, I lay down on my couch, stared at the ceiling, and through a process very similar to trying to get to sleep while being a bit curious about what happened while you go to sleep, I let myself drift off into a deeper trip. This was the peak of my visuals, and while I let it, it certainly felt like a +++ (although was still a ++ since I could easily come out of it). The walls started to melt around, distort into absolutely intangible shapes, all while my mind did things I can no longer comprehend... what a cool experience.
194	Part of that, was one of the coolest things I've ever experienced - I saw the double helix of DNA in the sky, much, I imagine, like Francis Crick did so many years prior. Feeling a thought begin to form, I asked my friend to play Longview by Green Day - with a bassline conceived from an acid trip. It fit exactly well. I realized just how similar all of our thought processes were, and really felt connected to everyone else in the world.
195	Anyway, I guess at that point it was a bit before, or actually more likely, a bit after 4:00. We decided to go out into the woods again, this time with a different assortment of people, and the tiny bit of weed that we had between us. The goal was for two of my friends to study for a math test coming up, while getting high, and I was coming along for the walk. We went to a lesser-known spot in the woods. My original plan was to not smoke with them - I wanted to experience as pure an LSD experience as possible.
196	They talked a bit about math, and I thought a bit about other things - well, at the rate I was going, everything all at once. Here I'll explain what my 'LSD mode' is - it's what really made me realize how much of a stimulant LSD really is. My thoughts would start somewhere, then, instead of just going linearly from one thought to the next, they seemed to bounce, for some reason I want to describe it as back and forth always moving up, always moving towards more abstract thoughts and concepts, always towards the same sorts of satisfying conclusions (one of which was the idea of the logarithms - that many concepts we had that are rated on some scale are really logarithmic, not linear, and that everyone has a different 'zero point' - a different spot on that scale. I can pin that idea on the video I had watched earlier). The disturbing part about the thoughts were that they continued faster than I could have them - I felt like I totally understood each point they were bouncing off of, but at the same time, if I tried to actually conceptuallize any one of those points into communicable or even just 'normal' thought, it took far too long, and I missed a few of the points ahead. I was able to, with intense concentration, commit a few of these steps in a single thought to short-term memory, and after a while, to talk about them to my increasingly high friends. They couldn't fathom how I was thinking, so they thought it pretty funny. I did too.
197	I'd like to mention a few of the more poignant thoughts I had at that point. First off, I should note that this really felt like another peak of my trip, and it was just like my previous auditory and visual trips, although this one was in another sense. I thoroughly believed that there were, for sake of argument, 4 senses - visual, auditory, tactile and the last one, which I'll call chronospacial. The other two 'normal' senses, smell and taste, were part of chronospacial and tactile, respectively (although there was certainly some overlap). I believed (and it would come mostly true) that I would experience 4 seperate major trip events, like the previous two, and that this was the chronospacial turn. Basically, it messed with time, space, and primarily thought - the things involved with this sense that I had come up with. At this point, I was sort of bouncing fairly quickly between this strong +++ trip and my baseline. After that thought came through (well, I was chronospacially tripping, so order really wasn't important to me. It may have been before, I'll talk like I knew any sort of order, but it may not be right), I really started to feel the LSD jitters - I got a very funny feeling in my legs like I had been all day and on a previous trip on LSA, like they had just about fallen asleep, and the bloodflow was returning; I also physically was jittery at that point - my jaw particularly was vibrating pretty violently. I had heard that weed was good for this, and I decided to try it. The others had already smoked a bit, but they were more than willing to pack another - in this case, since we were pretty much out of everything else, a kief pack of my friend's pipe. He had to leave at that point, for either work or class, leaving just three of us on that little hill in the woods. It certainly helped calm the jitters quickly, and sprung my trip back up.
198	Earlier in the year, one of our good friends had taken a leave of absence from school, and wasn't going to be back until at least the next year. We really missed him. For today, in wishing me a happy birthday, he mentioned to 'smoke a bowl for him.' The type of request that I would usually think about, but never to the degree that I did right there. In smoking that bowl, I was brought right back, almost completely right back into the experience of one lazy saturday morning wake-and-bake with him and one other friend on that same little hill - at that point I was on a t-break, but I still managed, with little effort, into coaxing them accidentally into smoking far more than they were expecting to - 5 big bowls from a BIG bong. I remembered all the details of the experience - although my visual, auditory, and tactile senses were still back there in reality, my chronospacial sense was right back in that old experience. That was absolutely amazing, and truly a great sense of smoking a bowl for someone. I had never missed him more, and I felt great in a reminiscing sort of way.
199	One more thought I had that I shared with everyone else was about our perception of reality. After a recent salvia trip, I had realized suddenly the difference between perception and reality, and a big part of my current theory on what reality truly was, and how we'd never even be able to come close to comprehending everything in reality, and that the 'reality' we're in - this universe, etc. was just part of our perception of actual reality. Anyway, I wasn't talking about this idea - we'd already talked about this some time prior. First, I had a funny thought about how we'll never really be able to replay experiences ever again. We can remember quite a bit about them, but we can't go back and relive the whole experience - we can't be there again. I thought about the salvia trip I had, and how, although I can imagine what I saw, I can't see it again, and furthermore, how I'd be able to recall the experience at that point, but I'd never be able to have the experience, to feel the same way, to think the same way, etc. After that, I talked to my friends about a funny idea, almost fear that I sometimes had, that I was living life like the main character in A Beautiful Mind - basically, that my friends were all in my head, complete schizophrenic hallucinations. It was thought-provoking, and to satisfy myself, I came back to a conclusion I got during the perception vs. reality discussion from the salvia trip - that it didn't matter, that all we all had was the approximation of reality we see in our perception, so it didn't matter what was real, as long as the perception we lived in was the best we wanted it to be.
200	I can't recall whether it was the cause or the result of that discussion, but at one point, we seemed to have an entire discussion about some topic, none of us actually using real words for a while, seemingly in each other's heads. It wasn't just me - the other two agreed with me that that had happened successfully. It was odd that it mimicked the way I was thinking so well (in progressing thoughts with and without understanding any of them, at the same time).
201	Another big theme I felt there (again, all this is totally out of order, but order doesn't really matter when you're brain is in that state), was almost like deja vu. While I was sitting there, looking down, I could see my legs and arms, and I was aware of the sunglasses I had on my face (I was wearing them all day, I liked them, and they came up a couple of times), and it felt... right. It all felt familiar, I guess it felt like it had all come to this point, this was the greatest point ever. I kept thinking about the word 'LSD' at that point, and just seeing how well it fit. It agreed with the shape of my face, the shape of my glasses, the clothes I was wearing, the color of everything, it all felt so familiar as what I can only describe as perfectly satisfying. I hope that made some sense, because it made perfect sense at the time. Also, I felt a totally positive self-image. I had lost about 50lbs from that point last year, I felt healthier than ever, I had only started smoking, and truly expanding my mind in that year, and I really only gained friends, these friends within that year. I absolutely loved every part of me at that moment, and I even appreciated greatly that I appreciated myself so greatly.
202	Anyway, after some time of that, it was probably after 5 at that point, we decided to walk over to an eatery at the other side of campus, and we'd meet up with another friend there, since she was just finishing up class. The walk there was quite intense, since I was still strongly chronospacially tripping. A common thing that would happen would be for me to continue walking, with no idea how I was doing it, since it felt like my head and my thoughts were just sort of floating around. Random things in my peripheral vision, including the ground, stopped existing in my view of the world, my arms felt weird, time felt weird, etc. Again with that three different answers for time deal, I honestly thought it took an hour to walk there, I knew it was only about 10-15 minutes, and part of me wanted to believe that it was basically instant. Walking around people once we got out of the woods was interesting - it was the same experience with them as it had been earlier, only to a greater degree, and also I had no idea where I was, every knowledge of where I was, and my periphery was going in and out of existence. For parts, I felt like I could, not see, but know the entire path of where we were going and coming from, all at once, and other times, I was just floating thoughts again. At one point, while we were walking past a few buildings, I had entirely believed that we were one path to the right of where we were - it's not that I was visually tripping, but I had entirely interpreted what I had seen completely wrong. That's where I learned a lot about how our other senses relate to the chronospatial, looking back.
203	We eventually made it. I wasn't hungry (I wasn't expecting to be), although I did need a drink. This was going to be a challenge. This facility was a few different types of food all in one, with different cashiers and lines for food. I'd been there maybe twice before, but this time was really a challenge - I have always had social anxiety related to not knowing how to do certain social processes, and I realized, after wandering around for a tiny bit like an idiot, that I had no idea what to do. I ended up waiting in the Mexican food line with my friends, although I didn't want any food. When the lady asked me what I wanted, I told her that I just wanted a drink, and she said that I didn't have to wait in line, that I could go right ahead to the register. I still had no idea how to do this without cutting a line, so I told her it was alright, and only looked like a bit of an idiot. The most important part was that I not look like a tripping idiot, and I think I pulled that off. Anyway, I bought the large drink cup finally, and went over, wanting unsweetened iced tea. I filled an entire large cup with sweetened before figuring out how to get unsweetened - in retrospect I should've asked one of my friends to help me with that. It was alright, the artificial sweetener was bad, especially in that quantity, but it was liquid, and that helped.
204	We sat outside, in some of the most comfortably proportioned wooden chairs that have ever existed, and talked about the day, about how done we were with school, etc. There were a lot of people around (it was the start of the dinner rush), and they were all talking about the same things. I spent most of the time half listening, half letting my thoughts bounce around - to the outside, it looked like I was totally spacing out half the time. That period of time lasted for a while, that friend we were meeting met us there, and as it approached what I guess was 6:00, my other friend left to go to that math test. Around then, we realized that the sun was going to set pretty soon, and that we should totally go somewhere to enjoy it fully. We eventually decided on the hill not far from us that was the tallest hill in the county, and where the city's radio towers were. After another seemingly both forever and instant walk back to dormside, we got ready to go. At this point, that was sort of my last big peak, and was on the comedown from there.
205	5 or 6 of us packed into my car, and I took shotgun and let one of my friends drive. It's a somewhat powerful (above average, at least) car, and while we were on our way, at one point, I told my friend to gun it in second - and was immediately brought back to the first test drive, the first time I got to experience just how fun that car could be, sitting shotgun because I couldn't even drive stick back then. I also remembered a bit of woods on the north side of campus that I wanted to smoke in at some point that day, and made a mental note of that. We made it to the hill, which I thought was fairly cool. I had wanted to make it up there anyway, because I had always been a bit of a radio geek, and tower farms have always interested me. I really enjoyed walking up the hill, and thought about both the time the last year, my senior year of high school, on our senior trip to the Poconos, and how strikingly similar an experience it was - this sort of end-of-year experience that wasn't all the way at the end of the year, etc. I also thought about how I had never truly appreciated hikes like this with my family. We looked out on the landscape, which was beautiful, but it was hard for me to put into place exactly where everything I was looking at was. It was interesting seeing how still most of the landscape was, and then seeing the highway around the city, and all the streets, totally full of motion, like little ants scurrying around. I thought about what it's like to be in one of those cars, and what it's like to look out and see the whole picture (again, like the logarithms from before). I thought about the fact that I could see this tower farm from my window in my dorm, and tried to find campus, but couldn't figure exactly where it was. We took a look at the sunset, but couldn't get a great view, since it wasn't on the right side of the hill to get a good overlook. My friend who drove did take the opportunity to take some great pictures with the light shining through the woods, and got what is still one of my favorite pictures of me (fortunately, I can show it to people, because you really can't tell what I was on). We chilled up there until the sun went down a bit, and then headed back (the mosquitos weren't as strong as they'd be in a few weeks, but there were some bothering us). We drove back, this time I sat in the back, and I thought about how satisfying it was that the sunset wasn't a satisfying cutoff, I thought about what it was like being in the back of my parent's car as a kid, not knowing the way (although I did have to give directions a few times), and so on.
206	We made it back, at which point it was late enough that pretty much everyone was out of class. We all headed to my room, since it was the most comfy for holding a lot of people (with the couch and all). Everyone talked about the day, again about how they were done or almost done with school for the year, etc. Just good solid, happy conversation. Also, at one point, I got just a tiny bit of a tactile trip - I started feeling the texture of my pants, the shape of my sunglasses, and so on, and feeling absolutely wonderful for every bit of it. A few of our less close friends showed up to and chilled with us for a bit, there was a little bit of beer left (I didn't take any), etc. There were talks to try to acquire more weed, but that wasn't going so well at that point. After a while, pretty much everyone wanted to play kanjam out on campus somewhere - I didn't want to join because the plan was to also drink and smoke while doing that - I didn't want to risk getting caught like that, so I stayed back for a bit.
207	It didn't take long to get antsy, I packed myself up my bong and everything I needed to go along with it (at this point I'm maybe feeling +, but convincing myself I was totally sober, although I had the biggest urge in the world to smoke). Since we as a group were basically eniterly out of weed, I had to borrow some from someone else - it's great that everyone on my floor is super friendly, and I'm totally willing to smoke him out later, I just REALLY NEEDED to smoke at that point. It's hard to explain that urge. I'm on my way out, and I run into my friend who had been at her sorority thing of some sort all night thusfar (I hadn't seen her since the first time I went outside), and she happily agrees to go with me to the woods. We head to that spot on the north side that I had made a note to smoke at earlier, I talk about my experience up to now, she talks about her day with the sorority thing, etc. I smoked most of a pack of that bong by myself, as she was still new to the weed game.
208	The first really bad thing to happen all day was when we were almost done (oh yeah, and smoking was really bringing my trip back up), and we hear some people going around the woods - I bag up the bong (although it's totally set up still), and try to figure out what's going on - nobody ever came out to the part of the woods we were in, so we both sort of assumed it was public safety looking for us. A bit of freaking out later, and it's just some people starting a fire a little further away. We finish up, then get word that the other group was in the woods on the other side of campus. Cool, we'll meet up, hang out, it sounds great.
209	We leave the woods, and I make sure to stop for a second to look up at the stars - I had wanted to lie down, but the grass was very wet. It was a very clear day, and you could see tons of stars. Two things happened to me during that.  At one point, I totally heard a rave that didn't exist going on around there, and sort of had the experience in my head to some degree - definitely auditory hallucinations, and a bit on that chronospatial, but not too much. Also, for the first time I totally understood constellations. I had always been able to pick out the shapes and such, but this time, I was actually able to see the horses, the people up there, superimposed over the stars. That was pretty cool.
210	We continued on our way, and made it to the woods, although we weren't yet at our destination. As we were finally approaching the spot, we, and everyone already at the spot, saw a flashlight, followed be somebody in a deep voice yelling 'Hey, there's kids in there!' The way they were talking, it was as though it was the cops, trying to give us a chance to get the hell out of there, because they were looking. I wouldn't have freaked out, since everything I had on me was away, and I felt confident in my ability to refuse a search and whatnot, except that I entirely believed they had drug dogs with them. I panicked pretty badly, along with everyone else, and was trying to decide whether to ditch my stuff or not - I believed the most rational thing to do was to run. I tried to make it to another path that eventually led across a stream and back to dorm side, but I missed the entrance to that (nighttime in the woods is just about the worst situation for trying to get any input from your senses - which led to it being terrifying in both instances), and ended up cornering myself basically in the swamp. All along, I was thinking, if I didn't have all that stuff on me, I was going to check out the situation, see if it actually was the cops, and maybe end the panic altogether. I was really hoping that someone would do that, and not long after thinking that, it sounded like someone was doing that, although I had entirely believed that, from the sounds of it, it actually was the cops, and that there was no way out of it for me. I should also mention that, since I had already been caught earlier in the year, if I got caught again, I was basically out of school, which basically meant I was afraid for my life. Just a little more of that panic, before it all came out that the 'cops' were some drunk third-years who were playing a bit of a prank while they were looking for one of thier friends who had made his way through the woods somewhere. I was not the only one to thank them for the experience - now that we knew it was totally safe, I realized that I had not been that absolutely terrified in a long time, and in retrospect, it was thrilling. I honestly believed that I was not safe, and that doesn't come up often.
211	We made our way back to the dorms - I can't recall if we went out again after that, so I'll say we didn't. We all talked over what had happened for a bit, and then, because it was still a weekday, slowly started going off to bed. At that point it was around midnight, and I myself made it into bed.
212	The next day, I was mentally exhausted, did hardly anything, and still went to sleep early. Both that day and the day after, when I smoked, I was brought back very slightly into my trip, although even at its strongest, it was barely a ++. I have not experienced any other flashbacks since.

215	I'm 15 an I live in manchester,england and I had a fucking weired experience on holiday in majorca.I was out on the beach one morning when a guy came up 2 me and asked if I wanted sum 'stuff' he then whiped out a bag of skunk and some blotters,I was aprehensive about the acid as I had never tried it before but I decided to buy a couple of trips and some skunk.Later at the hotel I met up with a friend and had a couple of joints out of the window.I then took a tab in the lift.When I got off I saw a hypnotist in the bar asking for volenteers,so naturaly I got up there.He told me I was going to give up smoking, so he sat me down and he told me to  close my eyes and let my mind drift,which was easy as I was stoned and hallucinating slightly!!! I then found my self in the most relaxed 'floaty' mood I have ever experienced in my life.The colours were drifting round my face,I wasnt sure if I was in a trance or tripping.Next thing I remember was waking up in my room 6 hours later totally awake and alert. I was told the next day that the hypnotist couldnt wake me and a doctor had been called!I have recently tried to recreate this experience with no effects near the ones I experienced before.

217	My name is Casey, I go to college in Oklahoma. All the years of highschool I had wanted to trip but in our little town, acid is unheard of. I finally got the chance last Feb. 13. Lucky thirteen!
218	The day before the trip I get a phonecall from my friend Slim, he informs me that he found some acid (obviously knowing I would be interested). I was excited. I told him I wanted to drop early in the morning, so I could see the sunrise. Which was supposed to be the cool 'trip' thing to do, according to my friends. 
219	I arrived at his house about 5am, he was already up and ready to drop (this was his first too). He presents a piece of wrinkled tin foil about the size of a playing card, he unfolded, and inside I counted six little scooby doo heads. I couldn't wait!!!
220	We decided to split it up down the middle and go for broke. We drop our hits at the same time and stare at each other, for a moment before laughing at each other. We were nervous and very excited at the same time.
221	About 5:30, the sunlight is starting to show a little. I feel nothing, slim says he is starting to feel it. He said he felt like he was in a rollercoaster. This was the last thing I remember him saying for quite awhile, because at that instant the sun peaked up over the hills, and my trip began explosively. The sun came up, and it was the most glorious thing I have ever seen, I heard the william tell overture throughout the suns magnificent arrival to our day. The sun radiated off waves of light in synch with every symbol crash of the symphony going on in my brain. This lasts what seemed like hours but being perfectly content with it, I didn't mind. 
222	Im interrupted by Slim saying something about the sun winking at him. I stare at him for a second, and begin laughing hysterically. We both fall on the floor laughing and talking about what we saw during the sun's appearance, acting like a couple jocks winning the championship. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen in my life. I was in love with LSD. I have since tripped maybe 500 times, I have never had a bad trip. I have never felt better in my life.

225	At the time of my experience I had been experimenting with hard drugs for about one month but so far had only taken ecstasy and cocaine. On this night me and a few of my friends had planned to buy some mdma and have a fucked uo night. The person who supplied the mdma did not have the ammount that we requested however but we bought what he had which was 0.6 grams. I dropped 0.2 grams of the mdma and thoroughly enjoyed myself for a few hours.
226	My friend, who had taken lsd before, informed me that he could get some if I wanted to do it. We headed off to get the acid and once we got it I dropped a tab.
227	Once we had returned to my friends house I began to trip pictures and people in the room swirling in mad patterns this was amazing.   For me, LSD the affects can last for hours and eventually after destroying pumpkins, laying against a wall, eating mass amounts of sweets and pulling endless toots the acid began to get very boring and eventually I wish it away.
228	Soon after this me and my friends decided to try and sleep I remember trying to watch the film the devil's rejects but becoming confused every few seconds as to what was a trip and what wasn't. I layed down and tried to sleep and all that I can remember where two red lights dashing around the ceiling and seeing a young girl running towards me with a hand full of flowers. There was nothing but white and she began to hit me with the flowers. I then awoke and in a very confused state sat up and questioned my friend as to  'what the fuck we did the night before. His answer was one that I will never forget 'I don't know but for some reason I'm wearing a bra.'

231	I wanted to experience whatever LSD gives you, and this may have been the only chance I have to do it in a very long time, so I decided to drop two tabs. Apparently these tabs were Pure L and 250 ug each. I got a little nervous after having heard that, but I didn't panic. I did it with two friends, and my girlfriend. One of the friends, along with my girlfriend, dropped one tab, where I dropped two and our more experienced friend dropped three, (fuckkng 750 ug)
232	So at first I didn't know what to expect, and then euphoria came. Everything was funny, and I mean everything. We just looked at dumb memes on this huge tv that was in the room and laughed our asses off for about two hours, and then shit got weird. At some point someone turned on dark side of the moon, and I was laying in bed watching the ceiling melt. My girlfriend is an artist, so she had s bunch of her pieces hug up around her room. They looked so Trippy, especially the self portraits, I thought the paper was melting off the wall. At one point my experience friend said he was seeing waves so my new friend starts explaining longitudinal and transverse waves to him, asking what he was seeing, and eventually he comes to the conclusion that he was seeing surface waves. There is a napkin with waves drawn all over it, along with the words help, night vale, and the number 17. We started watching these videos, these Trippy as fuck videos like double King, fever the ghost (source) and elephant garden. I thought they were super cool, my new friend got freaked out by them. In one of the videos there's a pair of dancing shadow guys with masks. And I swear to God I was seeing them in the corner of my eyes all day. This was the best part of the trip to me, nothing was really making sense and all that we were doing was laying on the bed or looking into mirrors. The house is actually an apartment, with two floors. We agreed to stay in her room for the peak, but I really really wanted to go outside for like 10 seconds to look at the sky, unfortunately it was a gray and cloudy cold as fuck day, so there wasn't really anything to see.
233	About two hours after that we all eventually came to a consensus that we wanted to go walk to the park, something that was about a 15 minute walk away. My girlfriend kept trying to say stuff like 'oh it's gone now' 'I'm not high anymore' but then I would ask 'is the sky still moving' and she would accept that she was still tripping balls. We got to the park, no body was there. My experienced friend and I were just playing this this musical xylophone thing built into the play ground. Every now and then I would hear the song from that video, and I would see the little mask guys dancing in the shadows somewhere, at first it scared me but then I realized they're nice and I started to like it. This is when my girlfriend and my new friend started to have a bad trip. They both got filled with anxiety and were super nervous for no real reason, they kept saying that someone is gonna catch us, something bad is gonna happen, even though we were just some teens at a park. I calmed them down a bit and made them start enjoying it again, but then my new friend started to black out.
234	We immediately went back to my girlfriends place, making sure that the new friend did not fall or pass out. As we were walking me and the experienced guy started talking about some super weird shit, and now there is s video of me walking down the street sayin 'wub wub, wub wub wub' as a sentence and then getting a response of wubs from my friend back. At one point I said 'one wub unto the many' and we thought it was the deepest shit ever. Anyway eventually we got back to the room and chilled there. My new friend curled up in a ball in a chair and started talking about how much he misses his girlfriend, so we gave him a stuffed animal and named it his girlfriends name, which calmed him down a bit.
235	We went back to the park a few times, nothing too weird happened, colors changing and shit being weird, the usual. Then it was 10:30 pm, when we had to go home. We had already agreed not to drive, and we left the car back at my place and took the bus to my girls in the morning, but now we had To go back. The bus we took earlier was not running any more. It was 40 degrees Fahrenheit outside. It was raining. I was on acid. So we start our journey to the train, cold and wet at balls. We get to the train station and my experienced friend says 'gotta take a piss Brb' so he jumps the train tracks to god knows where to go piss. He gets back like 30 seconds before the train gets there, that made me nervous. We take the train to a transit center, then wait for THIRTY MINUTES at MIDNIGHT, TWENTY FEET FROM COPS, while its raining and cold. Some homeless people try to finagle us out of our money, but they give up eventually. That was the longest thirty minutes of my life. Eventually we get on the correct bus and get back to my house, where it took me like an hour to fall asleep.
236	So, I didn't have an epiphanies, nothing really deep realized about myself, it was just a fun time. My girlfriend didn't have the best Time, but she was nervous because we were at her house, she she's willing to try again. My new friend doesn't want to do it ever again, he just wants to stick with weed. My girlfriend realized she's too uptight about stuff and my friend realized he's An anxious piece of shit, and I just had fun. Hopefully that's not a bad thing for dropping 500 ug after never drinking smoking or doing any drug ever before.

239	It was about 10:30 when my friend gave a me 3 tabs of the acid(1 for me and the other 2 weere my friends)my friend took a corner of hers right away to try it out...3 periods after I decided to try it out so I took about half of it at like 12:30 and kept it under my tongue for 30 minutes and about 40 minutes later after I took it, it started to kick in. I felt really happy and giggly, my entire body felt like it was tingling  and the. Last period came so i took the rest of the tab and so I was in Spanish just watching home alone laughing.there was 20 minutes left till school ended and I got called up to the assistant principles room.
240	Once I got there he said I heard some rumors about u and some kids trying acid...I said no and the nurse came up to look at pupils...that's when it really kicked in and her face looked like it was melting..they let the buses leave and they started checking my pockets and back pack bc my pupils where the size of the fuckin moon. I ended up getting detention bc j had a vape in my pocket. They grabbed my pockets and totally missed the acid so that was good but then all three of the assistant principles were in the room asking me what I took...I said nothing and they brought me to my asistwnt princluples office where they called my dad...the carpet was beutiful and and patterns and colors everywhere where amazing. He had me sit in a conference room until my parents came to pick me up. I sat there just amazed staring at this chair stretch and shrink, move closer and farther and there was this window with this huge tree that just looked amazing. The whole room was turning green and red and orange and there were flowers all offer the floor and I look at myself in a glass window and my hair was like floating up and glowing. Supriseingly I wasn't scared or anxious at alm throughout this and when my mom heard I was on acid she told them my eyes where big because I took an adderall that day so they would let me go home.
241	I got home and just took a shower after I had this convo with my mom...she didn't care too much that I was on acid bc I had good grade in school and am mostly mature (she might have thought that I had only ate a pot brownie) The shower was amazing and there were patterns all over the tiles and my dad was playing the drums downstairs and so that was cool. After I got out of the shower I walked out of the bathroom to find my sister, her friend, my mom, and my moms friend talking them not even knowing I'm on acid tripping hard. I danced around my room for a little bit and had so many thoughts flowing thinking about life. 
242	Later that night at like 7 my friend who also took that day came over and his face at like tribal symbols over his face and we just talked about the next day and what we were seeing...I ended up falling asleep looking at the closed-eye visuals which looked like this rainbow of intense colors my eyes have never seen before.

261	I began to feel the effects an hour after ingestion of a liquid hit dropped on a sugar cube. At first I saw mild distortions of shapes and objects began to look funny. Shortly after I had stopped writing in my journal because I believed it would be better to fully enjoy the experience and forget about logging the details.
262	My senses were mixing with everything around me. I tasted lights. I felt as if everything around me was a flowing texture of sensory data and emotion. I felt heavenly. Everything felt right. I felt like I was doing the right things with my life, and that I was treating people the way they should be treated. I could not understand at the time how someone might have a bad trip on this stuff.
263	I had visual hallucinations but the emotional charge on objects around me was what moved me the most. I had visual hallucinations but the emotional charge on objects around me was what moved me the most. I ignored most aspects of the visual hallucinations and focused on what intrigued me the most. It felt extremely spiritual.
264	This was a very profound experience, but I was in a safe setting and it lasted 12 hours.
265	The next day, I felt charged. I feel like quitting drinking, and I feel motivated and goal-oriented. I feel 'fixed'. I am confident. I do not regret it the least bit.

268	The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 
269	I have taken LSD several times, usually between 2 and 4 'hits'.  With this particular batch, I felt the hits were fairly potent.  I decided to take 9 in my dorm room.  (5 days ago, I had taken 4 hits, so I probably had a light tolerance built up)
270	The experience was similar to a 4-hit trip, except the visual hallucinations were more vivid, perhaps more synthetic(?)  Far more interesting for me was the audio.  I had not noticed it until a good 5 hours or so into the trip.  I heard a faint creaking in my mind, sort of like rapid pulses of sound like a modem noise over the telephone.  I found that as I concentrated on this noise, playing it up in my mind, it grew louder.  I could hear distortions of this sort of 'data stream' noise analogous to the settings in an audio program such as Pro Tools or Sound Forge (modulation, frequency, wow-flutter).  Very bizarre and very cool.
271	Up until this point, I had doubted the notion that LSD could produce auditory hallucinations greater than the sort of 'whirr' that accompanies most serotogenic trips of mine.  Here, the LSD seemed to generate its own stream of sound, independent from all sounds in the room. Here, the LSD seemed to generate its own stream of sound, independent from all sounds in the room.  I tend to view LSD as the most natural-feeling of the 'synthetic' hallucinogens - however, the sounds I heard reminded me more of the synthetic character of, say, 2ci.
272	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
273	I first took the hit in front of the mirror. I went out of the bathroom and held it under my tongue for about 30 minutes then swallowed. I started looking up at the ceiling and saw bugs gathering around the ceiling fan. The patterns on the ceiling looked really intricate like a top-notch old western painting. I knew it was just the Christmas lights reflecting off of the tree. I took LSD for my first and last time that day. It was Christmas break and everybody else took more hits than me so it was like they were in a different world. I wanted to be alone so I went out to my car and when everybody else got in I thought they were trying to set me up. I knew that they were my friends but I just wanted to trip by myself, as I though that was the best way to trip so that I didn't have any distractions.
274	While I was in my car I stayed up the whole night from 11pm to 12am and went to work while I was coming down. I made pizza and that was the easiest job to trip while I am working. During that time in my car I lost half of my ego. I thought that I turned into somebody else and I had to tell all of my friends that I wasn't really human. I believe that is the true feeling of dying. I turned into something else other than an earthly body. My soul carries on. People may think that the reasoning behind LSD is to seduce people. But the true good trips are those that make one loose their ego and bring one back down to reality. Reality is just an finite spec in time.

277	' we were waiting for it to kick in, and by the end of the night we were like,' oh thats just a space ship. Thats all.'
278	We took our drugs around 10, as soon as they kicked in we became wrapped into the movie we were watching, it was snowing in my room, the cold air of the atmosphere, steamed on our skin, like pouring cold water on a hot frying pan.. The room was breathing, walls were bending, we could tell there was a war or something like it going on outside from all the flashing lights and shaking of the room.. I had to pee all the sudden, so I got up to go to the bathroom, the journey 4 feet seemed like a walk across the desert, once inside the bathroom, I could see that my reflection was not me, I thought, who am I, is this what I look like, and why is my face dripping, I'm not sure if I ever even got a chance pee because I became intranced by the character that supposely was my reflection.. I remember thinking to myself, this is my reality, and if yours is anywhere close to mine, then your fucked...

281	It was A gloomy October 31st...yes it was all hallows eve. Me and my friend who will be called J set out on A journey. Our minds clear and deep we purchased some acid. Everything started at 5:00 Pm darkness had just sat in, we are in my apartment we comsume the blotter pieces at 5:30. 45 minuites later my body felt light and I sat up to shake it off. After this time had passed I felt like I have never taken a drug before. My friend J was also feeling the same effects. We decided to go out and walk the town as soon as I set foot outside I suddenly became strangely inebriated. The external world became changed as in a dream. Objects appeared to gain inrelief; they assumed unusual dimensions; and colors became more glowing. Even self-perception and the sense of time were changed. When the eyes were closed, colored pictures flashed past in a quickly changing kaleidoscope. After a few hours, the not unpleasant inebriation, which had been experienced whilst I was fully conscious, disappeared. I came back to reality for a moment and relized there were two cops talking to me saying son what have you injested? I said Lsd; I thought to myslef he cant do anything he cant prove anything so I told my story. He took my firend and I back to our apartment and we walked in and sat and let the Lsd dive into our minds.

284	I took the hits around 7 p.m. on a perfect spring day.  About 20-25 of us were hanging out in a field waiting for it to kick in.  After 30 minutes, I started to get an ongoing rush in my chest, and I went across the field to my friends house and jumped on his trampoline for awhile.
285	Once I got off the trampoline, I started to feel pretty weird.  I met up with my dealer so I could buy another hit for later.  Me, him, and one other person took off on bikes.  My dealer stopped and looked at me and when he turned around he looked very wavy and he told me to give him the money.  For a second I thought he was robbing me, but of course, he was just going to get the stuff.
286	Me and the other kid sat on the curb waiting for him.  While I waited I looked down at the curb next to me and one of the stones there turned into an ant, and then another did, and another, until the ants were crawling all over me.  I started brushing them off and eventually they soaked back into the cement.
287	On the way back to the rest of the people, we took the train tracks.  As I walked along, I started to hear the increasingly obnoxious crunching of my feet on the coal, only when I looked down, I saw piles of brightly colored glass.  I didn't want to get a flat tire, so I picked up my bike.  We got to the end of the tracks and we had to climb down a small hill.  I got to the edge and slipped.  I started to slide down on the glass, but once I reached the end, I was fine,  I never even fell.
288	Eventually we made our way to another friends house, and after a little while, everybody showed up.  We put in The Wall, and fell into a deep couch.  As soon as the first note was played, I got burst of air in my face.  I leaned over towards my friend and it seemed like the wall of the living room followed me, and I could now see through it.  Another kid walked in, who wasnt tripping, and he sat in the front.  The DVD player shorted out, and without saying anything about it we all yelled at the kid that just walked in.  He stood up and everybody started to make fun of him.  He was really just trying to fix the movie, but I thought he was trying to act like daffy duck and put on a comedy skit.
289	After that was over we went for a walk.  Me and three others split off from the huge group and went our old middle school.  We sat for there and just tripped face for about an hour, then we decided to go back to the house.  We came to a hill that led down to the road, but we were all afraid to go down.  I decided it would be best to get it over with and jumped in.  I quickly jumped right back out because I thought the tall grass was stabbing me all over.  We found a path down, and we walked the sidewalk back to the house, and on the way, me and my one friend dodged across the street right in front of a cop, but for some reason, he didnt say anything.
290	When we got back, we just sat around watching horror movies while we were coming down, because it turned out to be Friday the 13th.  Needless to say, that was the craziest night I experienced up to that point.

292	So I had just dropped 2 hits of acid questioning the real strength of this drug and oh boy was I wrong about it
293	Dosed at midnight, by 1 oclock I was playing halo 2 on my xbox 360 when I got this sudden burst of energy and then I look around the basement and I see all these colors pertruding out of the ceiling tiles. Just to let you know this waas my first time and I was in my basement without any1 to watch me. So then I hurd my dad coming down the stairs so then I ran to my bedroom which was dark and hid uner the covers and closed my eyes. Then I get very sweaty and panicky and started hearing these loud sounds as if my dad came down and through evreything to the ground, and then I questioned reality thinking mayb I was throwing evreything to the ground and I just wasnt seeing it kind of like an out of body expierence, and this terrified the hell out of me so then I opened my eyes and looked around my basement and saw evreything was normal and that ended the peak of my trip
294	The next couple of hours sucked the worst, I couldnt go to sleep, tremors, loss of appetite and my body tempature went up about 10 degrees and this lasted for the next 16 hours 
295	I am lucky my trip wasnt worse and the come down of lsd is sucks and I needed about 3 days to recover from it

298	It was friday night and me and my buddies had planned to do acid for the past week. My buddy Shaun supplied the blotter tabs. I had bought four and was only planning on taking two (since this was my first time), but my friends forced me to take them all at once, so I did. It seemed like forever waiting for the acid to start working (45-60 min). When I started to get high I felt like my legs were soaking in a hottub, it was very relaxing. After about 10 min I started to feel the stronger effects, I couldn't stop laughing, even when I thought about hurtfull, depressing events that happened in my life all I could do was laugh about them. 15 minutes later I was still laughing, but I started to see stuff now. The walls of buildings would seem to sway and buckle, trees would seem to sway but there was no wind.I could hear a disturbance all around me (almost like static). I wandered around town like this for a while. There were times when I felt scared, like I was loseing my mind a very overwhelming feeling. I had to find cover so I went to the teen center. I stayed there and tried to watch T.V. In the back room but I couldnt pay attention so I turned it off. The tv then began to almost split apart but not quite,like it was trying to split apart. I then noticed the floor was doing the same thing. I left the teen center and wandered some more. I had lost my friends so I had no direction. I was so obcest with perfection that I lit my swetter on fire outside the fire station cause I had found some dirt on it.I then went home and layed in bed all night trying to sleep. I look forward to acid again.

300	LSD (2) : General (1), First Times (2), Various (28)
301	Last year in September I took some acid. I was 22 years old and a skinny guy. I purchased some 3 x small card board tabs
302	Unsure of print or  Pattern. Me and a group of friend's were attending a music festival, I took my 3 tabs about 30-40 minutes from the festival at about 11.30am. I also should say I am a fairly experienced user of LSD with this not being my first trip.
303	I started to feel the effects as we walked threw the gates and past the boys in blue. It really did hit me hard, I walked with my friends and my one mate who I had tripped with before guide me into the festival, I remember a lot of things going ' klaidescope ' of whatever the spelling. It was really intense, everything was wobbly, and morphing like good acid should be, for a good 2 or so hours we walked around, meeting new people gathering supply's and just exploring, in that time I was just a mess, I don't remember much in that time. I don't remember much in that time. 
304	We came to the blue stage where some friends went one way some the other so me and a couple of people decided to sit around and wait. I remember sitting there talking to friends and constantly touching the grass,  at this part I remember two things:
305	1) there was a photo frame set up for people to stand in and it had the stage in the back ground, there was two girls dressed up, I would call them fairy girls,  I asked them to take my picture, one girl replied  'do you have a phone' I didn't really know what I was thinking I just wanted my picture taken and had this thought about me being in a picture in a picture. Lol. I salute the fairy's and sit back with my friends. 
306	2) Was my trip guiding friend saying something to me, I can't remember what it was but it cracked me up, so much I was in hysterics, I couldn't stop laughing for a good five or so minutes, the proper giggles it was good, what ever my spirit leader said did what he attended it to do. Good fellow 
307	From there we went and got food, I purchase two sausages rolls and tried to eat them both at same time whilst laughing with myself following my group around, another half hour passes and I come to a point I realise everyone else is dancing and I'm trying to eat sausage rolls. So I THROW my rolls down and dance in victory over those delicious pastry's.
308	Some time past partying and killing time we came to another stage sitting on the grass, at this point I fairly sore and was laying up and down looking at the clouds and feeling the grass, the clouds were making  triangle patterns into each other. Also there was another moment where I sat up having a cigarette with my eyes closed hallucinating the warmth of the sun made me feel like a golden orb of some sort. The moment past we danced some more seen more people walked around did plenty of things. My trip started to settle a bit and when we were standing at the back of the stage I could see the clouds all flare up like in a time lapse in a big circle all around the stage. It was magical. Over time my trip settled and I could have conversations more and just function normally.
309	Later in the night towards the end I dropped a cap, I was told to be MDMA, I had a mad rush of heat and threw up about 3 times I had a pretty bad experience from then feeling mainly sick. I surely did feel the M came up and was somewhat peaking on the ride home more then usual it was weird.  I got back to the hotel 12-1am that night and got warm.

312	I have taken LSD for around 10 years, smoked Cannabis for 14 years and have tried most other soft drugs. I was at my friends house, we talked about various drugs and the effects, smoked a bit of grass and watched a few videos. Just before I left to go home he said he had some old LSD tabs (about 12 months he said) he brought out the packet, it contained 10 tabs with piece signs draw in red. Goody Goody I thought, ill go home ring a couple of mates get a few vid's in and we'll have a bash. 12 month acid probably won't work anyway I thought.
313	Got home called 2 of my best mates, it was about 7pm when they arrived. Sat down smoked a bong with hash and downed a Tab with a can of Lager. 30 mins later and a couple of joints nothing was happening(LSD wasn't working) we each ate another LSD tab and smoked another bong, we waited for another 45mins 'nothing'. Must be duff acid, by this time we were pretty stoned so time was starting to be difficult to pin down. It was around 9pm and me and one of my mates ate another acid and smoked another bong, BANG it was almost as-if it was waiting for us to take that one extra. I have had some excellent trips before but this took the biscuit, my friend who had the 2 acid left the house in a hurry saying he had to go(poor guy didn't no what hit him). Thats left me and Dave to finnish the acid our selfs, it get patchy and hard to describe as I'm not great at writing, but I will try, while sitting on the sofa with TV in corner and CD going, my vision became completey detached from what I was looking at, the room was gone, although it was gone it used the same lines which I could see just different? Weird shit. 10 hours later after a bad trip with spiders and fireplaces and curtains we started to surface and get back to talking to each other.

315	Two days ago, I went to get my second Tattoo done and my first one retouched, and decided, since I don't get tattoos often, and I had a tab with me, I should eat it, and I did, and let me tell you something, NOT A GOOD IDEA, at least not from the acid side, I was so concentrated on keeping the pain away, that I didn't peak on the acid, only after the tattoos where done and I relaxed, I got the acid working, and it was After Peak, I was comming down, and I was never really up, the good part is that I was able to keep most of the pain away thanks to the acid since when I relaxed, the pain also came flaring back with a Bad attitude.
316	So... Tattoo on acid, A good idea for the pain, A bad Idea for the Acid

319	The night I did two cubes was a crazy night, the experience was absolutely amazing. I had only done one hit befor I did these two, so it was quite a leap in dosage. In the beginning of the night I was having an amazing amount of fun, riding a bmx around, jumping off stuff, times where good. After maybe 2 hours my peak began, and it was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. The hallucinations where absolutely insane, stuff like trees swaying in the non-existent wind, and clouds forming really beautiful shapes. The most odd thing that I had experienced was what I call 'cone vision' where the middle of my sight seemed closer to me than it really was, while the outer sides of my sight was farther away than it really was.
320	The whole thing was really an odd experience. Then the anxiety hit me, I cant quite remember how scared I was that night, but I know that the fright was overwhelming. I soon realized, after my trip, that the reason I got so scared was because of the place that I took the cubes in the start. It was new to me, so during the trip, everything seemed new to me, too new, and thats what scared me the most... I think atleast.

323	On a clear night, I went to someone's house I didn't know that well with a new good friend of mine from treatment. I have gobbled tons of boomers in my lifetime but I had never experienced acid.
324	I felt like I knew what to expect: maybe to get a little uneasy  because it would be very intense. But this was not so.
325	Yes, it was more intense. Things seemed to move much faster than on shrooms. I ended up having sex on acid. This was something that was not planned! I saw stars, tons of them, beautiful stars,slightly deformed stars--- and the scenery was always immaculate. I studied everything, because there was so much demention, and it didn't have any similar hallucinations to shrooms. This was an individualized drug, I must say. Completely unexpected. I remember looking at a Kurt Cobain poster. Kurt was winking, smiling and even slightly flirting with me through his stares.I laughed at lot, this drug is so beautiful, I seemed to be seeing chinese dragons in trees and such, it was SO beautiful. Everything was.
326	The next 2 days I felt a little dead/emotionless but it all comes back.

329	Me and a friend had taken many hits of LSD before this intense experience. I was very educated on the drug and had a sincere passion for its effects. We got our hands on some LSD-25 blotter papers made in Switzerland. I took 3 and a half and he took two. We layed down on the end of my dock around 6 oclock looking up at the sky waiting for the LSD to kick in and the sun to start setting. About 1 hour and a half after taking it the most ridiculous things started appearing in the clouds, we saw many faces glaring at us. The clouds moved to form a huge spiral in the sky covering the entire sky. My mind and spirit left my body. I felt like I had no control over myself or anything else around me I went wherever the doses took me. Many other things happened during my trip that by the way lasted 16 hours. LSD is fun.

332	I can hear the music harsh rattling whirr and thump - marching human automaton technology rattling the ceiling up the stairs places crazy living noise party on the upper floors of the high-rise, banners draped from the uppermost windows block the light to the top half of the building. The lift doors all open into the black shaft makes a great image in the mind falling falling through the void crack! My head catching the steel girders of the shaft in hard fast deathpain clanging silence still falling. Real blackness now that would really whack bounce right off skull cracking on that steel edge. 
333	In this corridor is an old joystick arcade machine smashed screen behind circuit boards and panels are visible - a row of glowing oblong panels shoots from behind me just past my right eye and into the distance - click click - whirrr - patterns like Mayan idols line the outer extremes of my vision, dancing - morphing with solid liquid technology of mercury and hard frictionless plastic tac - seeds dying and reborn inside patterned in spiral matrix - in the party people are decoding - parts breaking off into reams of numerical digits and light - split like bad tracking - blips inherent in my system blocked messages of violence images seem to skip and freeze randomly - eyes roll in the sockets - lesbians with space cadet jackets held down below the shoulders mooch around sporting booze and fags, rat-hair matted layers give her extra. Huge rubbish piles and abandoned hoardings rot and overlap damply in a corner - in one room sun shines brightly through a solitary exposed window white as someone touches my neck inaudible whispers coolly into my ear Im watching the fenced road scarred concrete block landscape wracked with steel and synthetic frames the planet is a concrete and steel ice crystal in all directions splaying, growing outwards - cheek touch in the shiny milk light of the room. 
334	Another room steel sounds rain down force from the ceiling big black bags around this guys eyes like coal sacks all the way to the ears cap peak coming over straight darkening mechanic. Another room dusty, dark, empty time delaying. Another room he comes down on his victim heavy with a fist I see it all blood spurting out of his nose and mouth - sledgehammer - smash the huge lump of metal crashes up through the edge of his jaw shattering tooth and bone across the room man drops death gurgling head coming apart - Get out! Run! Leave the building blood from the victim splattered on my shirt mind spinning sickening turns - get away from there! Go! Darkness spinning in from all sides.

336	Last year, when I was 16 years old when I did acid to trip for the first time, previous times I had did 25I-NBOME which I identified by its strong metallic and bitter taste. The only reason I know this was truly LSD was because I had got caught at school smoking and they searched me, they found the LSD tablets on me and gave them to the cops to be tested, I later discovered through the police department it was indeed LSD. Also to note I dont remember a whole lot from this trip so I apologize for the choppy sequence of events. 
337	I was stoked to do acid for the first time and I was hyped for spring break, I chose my room as the place to trip. I took one tablet of 200 μg LSD the day I got out of school for spring break. I let the paper sit on my tongue for about 30 minutes and then I chewed it up and swallowed it. It was around 8:30 pm and I kept looking in the mirror to see if my eyes were dilated, they werent. I kept waiting as I layed in my bed. I cant remember whether I was meditating as I waiting for it to kick in or what. 
338	Eventually it did kick in and the first thing I remember doing is rolling around in my bed, laughing to myself. Then my sister came into my room, apparently I disturbed her by rolling around too much in my bed or something. To my surprise I was able to talk to her normally and I told her I was sorry and Id try to keep to keep it down. The reason why I was rolling around so much is because I loved he way the acid made my body feel, silky and elevated, and my head felt just wierd, but I enjoyed every second of it 
339	The next thing I remember doing is stripping out of my clothes and walking around in my room stark naked. I think I might have been dancing for a few seconds too. After a while I got horny and decided it would be a fantastic idea to jerk off on acid. It took a bit of effort but it was worth it because when I orgasmed I closed my eyes and a explosion of color took life under my eyelids and the orgasm felt sublime. 
340	After masturbating I laid in my bed, and decided just to let my new found euphoria take over. I was rubbing my hands up and down my body and I just kept drooling, I let it roll down my face and down my neck. I let my mind wander as I laid on my bed, It felt like I was floating but not at the same time. After a while I decided to get out of bed to use the restroom, before doing so I decided to put my clothes back on incase someone saw me. I took a piss and it felt strange peeing on acid, I felt it run through my entire system before leaving my body. After that, I just sat on the toilet seat and noticed my skin looked very stange, my veins looked like snakes slithering underneath my skin. As I left the bathroom, my mom was standing outside the door asking me if I was alright, I said I just had to use the bathroom really bad and she believed me.
341	Around 1 or 2 am I picked up my D.S. and started to play New Super Mario Bros. Quite frankly I was disappointed that it didnt look trippier on acid. And after that I decided to go to sleep. The next morning I felt the effects had completely gone away. However I look back on this experience as a positive one and I would do it again.

344	Hello guys I just thought I would share the best trip of my life that happened the other day
345	I ended up getting a Vial of LSD from a friend of mine containing a few drops of L. I ended up using the drops of course and was left with an empty Vial. This was some very strong acid and when I did it before 2 drops on a sour patch kid send me to another dimension. Little did I know what I was in for with this rinse.
346	12:00 p.m. dosed 4 mg of Klonopin and went to my friends. 
347	12:45 p.m start feeling the effects of the klonopin, my body is feeling loose and relaxed this is when I decide to light up a joint. 
348	1:00 arrive at my friends hung out with him and his family and smoked a few bowls before I had to leave. This is when I was feeling great.
349	2:00 p.m. arrive back at home and begin contemplating on enjoying a trip but did not want  to waste the acid due to the klonopin.
350	3:00 p.m. I finally decide to trip, but how? I have tabs and the coal but I decided to use the vial to see if a rinse is as strong as everyone says. I begin to pour a small amount of bottled water into the vial. I begin to squeeze it on the cap repeatedly and shaking it as hard as possible . I decide to put enough water in it for 2 doses and that was a great idea for me because if I did it all I would have lost it. I began to put half the liquid in my mouth and swallow. 
351	3:30 rolled a joint to smoke before the trip began, but I'm too late. I was already tripping hard. I begin to smoke and the acid is heavy. I start to become paranoid because I have never felt a come up this strong.
352	4:30 begin to peak hard. Tracers are everywhere. No matter what I look at it is morphing and tracing into multiple objects. And the colors wow was this a colorful trip. I was feeling so amazed by this drug. I feel like the acid is massaging my body, I feel so comfortable. I texted my friend and wanted to go hangout with him since I was tripping hard all by myself. The road looked like a cartoon. The trees were swaying everywhere and since it was a rainy day the rain literally was red, green, purple, and pink.
353	5:00 arrive at my friend's safely. We began to play games and he decided Cuphead would be perfect for me and boy was he right. The cartoon game was full of colors and tracers. he took a glance at my eyes and there was no color. I looked in the mirror and seen myself but it looked like my whole face was covered in eyes, weird. We wanted to smoke but I left the weed in my car so I went to get it. It must've took me 20 mins to find it even though I knew where it was. My mind was everywhere. It was dark outside and the rugs to my car seemed like arms reaching for me. This was scary but then I finally found it and went in to smoke. We smoked some bong packs and it was blast off time again. I stayed at his place watching Rick and Morty and playing Cuphead it was fun but it was midnight now so I had to leave. I was coming down slowly now but the dark seemed to have light. The rain was still colorful even in the dark. I make it home and decide to watch some music videos.i began to feel tired around 3 a.m. and I had to work at 7 a.m. so I decided to lay down. I close my eyes and wow I see so many things. The closed eyes visuals lead me to a dream like state and I finally fall asleep. 
354	I feel as if I got the full effects from the drug and saw the world in another way. I have tripped many times but this was the best. Please be safe and I hope this was a good description but it's hard for me to remember the details.

357	SO last night I decided to take acid for only the second time in my life. The first time I was 18 and I hated it but I have read a lot about the therapeutic benefits of LSD and thought it would help me to heal. I was on my own in the flat and put some calming music on.
358	I took half a tab at 3pm, and then didnt feel anything so took another half, half hour later, and then again another half, half hour after that. By 5pm I was wasted, I couldnt see properly or stand up, I ended up falling into my bed and just closing my eyes, I cant remember anything that happened, only my mind was racing so fast, I couldnt sleep, I was tossing and turning, so hot and sweaty and uncomfortable, and then finally at 4am I started to feel a little normal again. I was meant to go to work this morning but I was a right mess after no sleep. I'm feeling ok now, 24 hours post drug injestion, but I was just wondering what other peoples experience was. Did I take too much, was the environment not good? I must say I never want to take it again! I have DMT and find that a much more powerful and healing experience.

361	I woke in the summer morning at my parents cape house and had the urge to have an LSD experience. I took 200ug after waking up not worrying about being around my parents whilst on the substance. I sat on the couch in the living room listening to music and watching the tv waiting for the substance to kick in. Within 30 minutes I could feel the effects coming on. It felt simply wonderful. I was relaxed, excited, and enthusiastic about the experience to come. I felt at home as the psychedelic headspace began to take hold as I've had many experiences before and know how to navigate through the experience. I was eating a banana and enjoying a cup of coffee when I started to notice tracers from the motion of things and people. My thoughts were clear as ever and the effects felt simply wonderful. I had no qualms about being around my parents. As a matter of fact, I felt more at ease around them than I usually do, which was great. We decided we were going to have a beach day. The car ride to the beach was fun. I sat, composed, listening to music. It sounded wonderful. When we arrived at the beach, the visual effects were noticeable. The clouds had geometric royal-esque appearances to them. Watching the birds fly around above the water was amusing as the sun shone down on the shore. The headspace during the experience was wonderful. This was no doubt the correct dose for the occasion. The landscape was perfect for the experience. Colors were vibrant and the landscape were fantastic to view. Sitting in a chair on the beach, watching the scene in front of me couldn't have been less grand. It was an experience for the ages.

364	One day when experimenting I decided to drop some LSD, not necessarily for recreational purposes, and not to ever be intended again but to expand my consciousness and realize that there are other things to be known out their other than what we can see, also for spirtitual awareness, I theorized this whole concept that everything is connected we are all one, we all link to each other and all exist together as god. We are all god this experience was so amazing that it changed my life forever I realized that the world, universe and life is black and white, not literal yet figuratively. There is always an opposite of something no matter what one thinks it is there is something somewhere that is the EXACT opposite of anything one can think of. I experienced this whole world and shared my own experiences with others. I look at LSD not as a drug, yet a tool for knowing and prepairing for what we will be when we leave this plane. On my trip fractals also came in to play and the literal circle of life hallucination, which was EXTREMELY spiritual and I will never forget for the rest of my entire time spent on this plane. I realized that fractals are found everywhere in the universe which other scientists have also discovered but I realized that the infinite of these fractals are forever because the answer to the question of life is always going to try to be found in everything including the earth, which I believe is a living animal just as us. Fractals are these questions left to search for the answer for life, forever and ever searching for this logical explanation, which will never logically be answered. Since my life was changed that night I knew that their was another plane other than where we are living, that is the complete opposite of this material plane, scientist have also discovered something known as anti-mater which has been created in huge pipe tubes at labs underground, scientists discovered that when they get electrons traveling fast enough they put it through and anti siphon filter that turns the charge of the positive electron to a negative. This negative electron is known as Anti-matter and thus is basically a mirror image of the original electron itself this anti-matter is exactly what matter is not. There is a whole other world out there that does exist that we cannot see but 
365	is very real, as a matter in fact even more real than matter itself here on earth that we are all eventually going to experience.

368	I've taken acid quite a few times in the past. I've had many good trips, such as wandering in what seemed like an enchanted forest with friends to extremely bad trips like hours of not being able to breath properly with my heart pounding in my ears. I've never had a trip even remotely like the one I had about fifteen years ago.
369	I took some with another girl. She ended up scratching her skin to bloody pieces thinking things were crawling all over her. I totally felt like I perceived another reality. I couldn't move my body as it was just a bunch of molecules moving around. I couldn't see our three dimensional world at all. The air around me was alive and moving, and I saw many dwarf-like beings moving around intently doing things, but unaware that I could see them. My body was melted into the atmosphere so I couldn't move. To this day I'm convinced that the drug somehow opened my awareness to another dimension that we normally can't sense. Ever since that trip I feel like perhaps there is other life out there, but with our human perceptions, we can't begin to understand them.
370	Do you think I'm crazy? Was it lsd that I took? Have you heard of anyone else having a similar experience? Why did the other girl have a dif experience? Did we take dif amounts? Were we poisoned? I don't recall the specifics, other than we were told the tabs were saved from the '60's and there might have been two different kinds. The thing I will never forget is that was the most far out trip I've ever had, and it altered my belief systems and brought a whole new way of thinking. After all, we are just a bunch of molecules, perhaps somehow all joined together...

372	I had gotten the purple microdots from my friend Tommy who had taken them before and agreed to be my guide.  At about 9 pm we dosed and then just chilled and listened to music as we waited.  What happened next can only be described as full on hallucination of mind body and soul.  Vision of pure fantasy, feelings of pleasure and joy and an awakening of my soul to the universe.  These visions lasted for only three or four hours before I could tell that they were waning. 6 am was the greatest sunrise ever.  All that day after my face hurt from all the smiling I had done the night before.  Flashbacks lasted for many months but never eclipsed that first experience. There can only be a one first time and one should always use a guide.

375	A friend and I took one tab of a new batch that I got recently, looking forward to a nice trip with a walk in Central Park. Unfortunately, even though I purposefully didn't take my meds that morning, it wasn't enough time for them to dissipate enough to actually get a real trip out of it. I *felt* slightly trippy (eg a tiny bit queasy) and if I let my eyes relax and stared at a tree or whatever I could get a little bit of visuals, but my friend reported a really heavy, good trip with lots of visuals and I didn't have that at all. 
376	I looked the next day and apparently it takes 16 days for Abilify to be out of your system, and 5 days for Wellbutrin. I had thought because they're not SSRIs it'd be enough to just not take them that day and they wouldn't dampen the LSD, but I was wrong, oh well.

379	I'm somewhat new to the psychedelic drug world.  I've done mushrooms a few times, with decent results and salvia divinorum with no results.  Having been blasted with the idea that LSD is the ultimate psychedelic, I was prepared for intensity of my first trip, which never came.
380	The drug simply made me think, for a really long time.  I was awake for hours having these seemingly in depth conversations with my friend.  At one point at about 6:30 am, we went outside to watch the sunrise and I was awe stricken and humbled by the heavens above.  At one point a jet passed by and it was so intense I fell to my knees.  I was simply humbled by the drug, and was not getting any visual affects from it.  My friend took the same dose, and he's done LSD many times before, and he tripped pretty hard, so I know the acid was good.
381	When we went inside, this was pretty comical.  We ran into my friends father who, of course asked why we were outside at 7am, and we calmly explained to him that we were on acid and couldn't sleep.  We had a brief conversation and proceeded back to my friends room.
382	It was only at this point I noticed any visuals at all, perhaps because of the changes in lighting from outside to inside.  I noticed his floor waving like water, it was a blue carpet.  Most noticeable was his face began melting and moving in ways similar to the animation in the movie 'Waking Life'.  I mentioned it to him, and he laughed, happy that I had any visuals at all.
383	Next time, he recommended smoking marijuana to increase the liklyhood of a visual experience.  I may do it again, but not very soon, it's really not worth it at this point.

387	My friends Chris and Alex were over at a good friend of theirs' house one friday night, and I had to work. I was planning on going over there and dropping acid for the first time after work, but things didn't work out well. I ended up over at Chris' apartment the following Wednesday, and I dropped my two hits then.
388	My history with psychedelics is as follows: I have eaten chocolates on several occasions, I frequently eat DXM, I have tried morning glory seeds, and of course I smoke herb on a daily basis.
389	Anyway, I popped the two hits in my mouth at around 7:30 and sucked on them for a good 5 minutes, making sure that they were soaked into my tongue, and then swallowed them. I jammed with Chris for a while, not really paying attention to anything. About an hour later, I realized that I was not experiencing any effects. Alex suggested that my onset was just slower than most people's. I didn't want to believe it, but I did and went outside to smoke a cigarette. At 9:45 I was beginning to think that Alex had fucked me over with fake acid, but I watched him cut my hits from the same blotter him and C had done the previous Friday. I kept waiting for any psychedelic effects, but they never came and I finally went to sleep around 4:30.
390	Let me also say that I have eaten chocolates before to extremely minor, if any, effects. Meanwhile, Chris always trips out of his mind when he eats those.
391	I don't understand why I could eat these psychedelics and not feel a damn thing?

394	Just me and a friend in my apartment. Took 2 doses and it came on quick. My friend turned on some Grateful dead and we sat with our eyes closed. Now about the time that space came on I was in a world of pros and cons. I was looking at every action and it was spinning off into infinite possibilites. I have been to this place many times and I was totally comfortable here. Then a sound came into my being. It was disrupting me. In that moment when I thought that I couldnt take it anymore and I was about to pop a very funny thing happend.   My head opened like a lotus, and I ejected into space. For a moment I was sitting weightless totally content and at peace with the infinite. Then infront of me a vibration started. It was was almost like space and time was ripping apart. I started to become restless and afraid. Then out of nothing something started to appear. At first it was just a speck then out of that speck a hand fractled out ward untill there were infinite hands all with eyeballs in the palm. The a body and a head followed. I looked on in wonder at the sight before me. Then I could do nothing but open my eyes, and when I did I was totally sober. LSD IS a hell of a drug!

399	So, I recently just found a very reliable acid connection. It being something that I always wanted to do I went and bought some the day I found out about it. Instead of waiting for a good day when I could hang out with friends I chose a night that I had to sleep in my own house. Having experimented with salvia before and loving it I had real high hopes for acid.
400	So I took it and sat down in my room to watch Dude, Wheres my Car. I  got to the ostrich scene and still nothing happened. I was pretty angry. But then I got a phonecall and my friend invited me to go smoke with him and some other kids. I went outside and then I just felt a little bit off, I couldn't really put it into words. I saw lots of stuff flying around in the sky but I still couldn't tell you if it was birds or not.
401	I actually have a lot of sober hallucinations, I constantly see people looking at me or walking around staring at me. Its been going on for years, so I'm just used to it now.
402	But anyway, I met up with the kids and smoked probably 4 bowl packs before I got dropped back off at home. There were no increases from when I left my house, so I figured my source wasn't as reliable as I had thought. I turned on the crazy asian flick Battle Royale and fast forwarded it to when they are inside the school. Then all of a sudden from the top right corner of my vision it turned bright lime green. I could see the light reflecting on things around and when it very quickly dropped to the bottom let corner of my vision.
403	I sat in awe for a moment because I didn't think it could happen so suddenly. Then everything started to glow and change between blue, green, red, purple, orange, and yellow. Then everything had its own individual pulse, everything just pulsated for so long. I started to watch the movie in complete awe, and realized I was so into it that my eyes were watering almost the entire time.
404	I finished with that and wet into my basement and played with my pure white persian cat. He wasnt pure white when I was petting him, but he still rocked. For hours that went on, then I finally fell asleep.

407	I met a friend at Marsascala and I took half a hit at 8pm. 9pm nothing, 10pm nothing, went home, nothing.
408	11pm: I was in front of my computer, I began to see all the colours of the rainbow then time had no meaning. I became aware that I was 23 years earlier in side my mother's womb and in 70 years at the most I would be dead and buried. What is the significance of 70 years when 70 years from now, there will be only the past and no future. I felt that there was nothing after life, we are only mammals ant that thought was horrible. I always thought that there was life after death and that's what is beautiful. But now I realized the opposite. There is nothing, we are only a bunch of chemicals and we will get dissolved into nature. Just as there was no I before 23 years ago, there will be no I after I die.
409	I thought: what's the great thing if I die? So much people have died! There are so many people who will live.
410	Well after the 3 days I spent in this state I became involved in a religious movement that promoted life after death. I want life after death! If there is no life after death its not worth living.
411	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
412	It was my first time. I took some really good shit. I got really hyper and talked more than I ever have in my entire life. I was also really loud and talked so fast that no one could understand me. I wasn't in any kind of controlled environment and there was nothing safe about where I was. I was with some friends though. I remember that I wasn't paranoid at all like some people are. In fact, we were walking down the street to a party. We all took the same shit, everyone was paranoid except me. Nothing too exciting happened at the party. On the walk home though I got really dehydrated. My friend took me to some guys driveway and I passed out. She got them to get some water. Some how they got me to wake up and I drank the water. I felt a lot better after that but it was really scary. I couldn't breathe very well and I got really dizzy. Also, the only kind of hallucination I had was while walking home (this was after I got dehydrated), a sign grew arms and pulled me towards it. I ran straight into the pole. That hurt like hell. I really like acid and have continued to take it. My only recommendations are that the user drink lots of water. Plus, it helps to drink something like orange juice as well.

415	I think it opens up a part of my mind that would otherwise stay closed.  It gives me a new perspective on life. 
416	I have tripped many times, but the time that I felt it the most was when I took 2 geltabs with many of my friends.  First, after about 40 minutes after ingestion, everyone became overwhelmed with euphoria to the extreme.  A smile became plastered on each of our faces.  Everything seemed so funny and I became incredibly happy.  But, we didn't actually start seeing visuals until a couple of hours later.  Slowly, you start thinking of some crazy shit that seems to make perfect sense.  Its impossible to explain exactly what trippin is like, is has be to experienced.
417	Once the visuals started it was amazing.  I never thought the mind could do crazy shit like that.  And it's great because you think clearly while seeing awsome hallucinations.  First, we went outside and sat under the stars in this vine-covered patio.  Everything twisted around and looked a bit fucked up.  I started moving my hand around this table and it looked likt the whole table was spinning in mid-air.
418	Another visual was when we were inside.  I sat at the top of the stair looking down at the brown carpet.  The whole carpet looked like a pool of quicksand.  It looked like they, my friends, were sinking into the carpet.  And in the kitchen it looked like the floor was a grate with some goo spilling up through the cracks.  Every slight crack in the wall would look like a huge hole and would pulsate bigger than smaller.  I could also see sound in a way.  The walls would move to the beat of the music, like huge drums. 
419	We stayed up the whole night and my friend, who's a dumbass had to work the next day.  We convinced him that he had to ride 10 miles to work on a bike because there was no way he could get a ride.  Actually, his mom could have given him a ride, but we convinced him otherwise.  He ended up riding all the way to work on a shitty bike with flat tires at 4:00 in the morning.  It was the funniest shit ever.  I remember everything about the night, but most of it just can't be explained with words, at least unless a person has tried it and knows what I'm talking about.

423	I have done many many drugs, but lsd has been my favorite so far. This is because I love ethogens, and how they make your mind work.This is what happened to me after I took lsd, how it changed me. I took 3 hits of acid, put it under my tongue, waited, took an hour and a half to kick in, but when it did, everything was alive and talking to me.  Skeletons grew out of my basement floor and we hungout for 6 hours while listened to the grateful dead. But my favorite thing about it was, I could feel love flowing through my veins, for the first time I understood the beatles. Of course, all you need is love! Since that break through, I havent been angry, I've been frustrated, I've been irritated, but not angry. Life is way better now, I used to constantly ask people about what they thought of 2012, and the end of the world, now.. Doesnt bother me. So thats my conclusion, lsd has opened my eyes, made me a new person.

425	I have taken acid only twice before this trip.  Later that day I have obtained 5 hits from a friend, he said they were very strong. That night I decided to take 4 of the 5 I had, I wanted to go over and beyond. I put them in my mouth and noticed I could actually taste a slight chemical taste as I chewed on them. I then sat back on my bed and waited for my trip to begin.
426	> 20 min later: getting board and so I start reading.
427	> 40 min later: start feeling my jaws get tense and teeth feel - somehow different.
428	> 60 min later: feel jolts of energy run through my body and notice slight close eye visuals and also slight open eye
429	> 80 min later: heavy closed eye visuals and notice my shades and carpet spiraling and flash colors, music sounds different somehow.
430	100 min later: started drawing on poster board but then noticed that the sides of the board started to bubble up and start smoking.   I found that my lamp was giving off intense heat and my room felt like a oven.
431	120 min later:  cat jumps on my bed and his hair starts to singe as he gets closer to the light. I picked up my glass of water and  found I could not drink out of it because the water was boiling be fore my eyes! By this time I saw my bed start to smoke. And my arm start to bubble up a bit.
432	125 min later: as I reach to turn off my lamp my fingers start to melt and drops of flesh spash on the carpet. I get scared and sit back on my bed realizing that my toes are metaphorically catching fire and as well start to melt off my foot.  By this time the hair on my legs are totally gone and my bed catches on fire!  I lay down again and this time have my legs off my bed extended straight out to watch my toes.  Then notice my knee cap bubles up and catches on fire.  About 4 to 5 min after watching this my leg melts off my thigh it drops but I don't hear it hit the ground.  I don't remember much after this but I remember I tripped for about 6 or 7 hours.

434	 It was winter in 2003. I was sitting around my house my parents were gone on business. I found an old vial filled with small blotter papers. I knew what they were when I saw them. I decided to take two and see what would happened. Nothing happened. So I took 2 more. I gave up. I went to bed.
435	Not long after a few hours tops I woke up around 4 am for reasons unknown turned on the light and the world was different. My bedsheet that had little black dots on it was moving up and down and the dots turned into triangles and back to dots. I walked down my hall which seemed to continue forever into the bathroom where I saw my pupils were completely diallated. I adventured to my computer to talk to people online. It took it forever to start. My whole body was knumb I felt no pain. The walls were breathing. I got up and stared at a clock and every 4 seconds in my mind was 1 second. I couldn't sleep that whole night. I stayed up listening to my mp3 player. I had to go to school. My sister gave me a ride she had no clue what was going on. The first thing that happened when I got into school was all my friends knew I was blown out. The tiles on the floor where like a never ending chess board. The lockers on the walls were brilliant colors and everyone was beautiful. In total my adventure lasted 7 hours. 2 hours to start. I've already used up the rest of the blotters foolishly.

438	The fourth time I experimented with LSD, it was a perfect day on Miami Universities Western campus.  Everyone in our expanded group of friends was tripping.  The happiest day of my life.  Several hours into the trip, while walking down the hallway of my dorm, I began feeling intense energy currents swelling up from the earth.  Walking, dancing, moving with this energy towards my room, I began to wonder if I could do something with this energy, like using the force (star wars).  When I got to my room and sat down on my bed I felt the energy rise up through my body and exit my head (third eye?)  As this occurred my friend Brian was launched several feet backwards, stumbling.  He looks directly at me in sheer amazement, 'Was that you?'  Yes, it was. Part me, part mystery.  My life has since been not the same.  It was a climax of sorts, as I had been moving in the direction of metaphysics and latent abilities of the mind for years.  The question that followed was, why this particular experience happened to me?  What does this mean?  The short answer: reality is way more than most people realize.  But researching psychedelic experiences I have yet to find another story that talks about people using energy to manipulate the physical.

441	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
442	So this is my first trip report but the intensity of the situation requires it I feel. So to start I managed to procure some really high quality 110ug blotters from the deep web and I had planned a cool trip night for me and a bunch of my friends. Im going to use false names to protect the identity of the people involved. It was I, landon, jesse, spencer, Jordan, Elliot, randy, spencer, and dean. At around 9:45pm I arrived at the trip spot (landons house) and all my friends were there eager to have a cool acid experience, This was landons and elliots first time. 
443	I had planned in advance to take a really high dose because I wanted to have some revelations and ultimately ego death. The dosages were Elliot-1 tab landon-2 tabs Jesse- 4 tabs dean-2 tabs Jordan-1 tab and I did 5. 
444	So we all dropped and everything was going good and flowing smoothly and oh boy did I start to feel it. Around an hour in someone requested I pull my car forward but the visuals were so intense when I stepped outside I was honestly impressed, when I sat down in the drivers seat of my car j glanced in the mirror and saw one of the street lights behind me and saw it swirl and there was a strong tracer. At that point I decided that this was a poor decision and I had misjudged the intensity of the acid I had just took, so I hopped out of the car and asked Jordan to back it up for me. 
445	The problem I knew I was about to run into was flow, I knew I would be relied upon to keep it flowing nicely for the group but I knew I wouldnt be able to provide for much longer I knew I would be relied upon to keep it flowing nicely for the group but I knew I wouldnt be able to provide for much longer so on my way back in I took some really deep breaths and paced myself for a potential anxiety nightmare. When I got back inside everything was still going good, Elliot and randy were sitting there playing madden having a good time and then the visuals and mindfuck hit me so super super hard, I honestly wasnt anticipating it. I'm a pretty experienced psychonaut and I'm aware that LSD is a pretty malleable substance if you know how to work with it, but damn, the situation became really anxious and tense. Randy had a really bad trip and he thought someone died and he was super anxious but somehow I never even noticed and I feel really bad about that. I kept looking up and I thought the situation was just normal and I was just too tripped out to comprehend but in reality everybody else in the group was equally as anxious as me. 
446	Landon was unable to handle LSD, LSD isnt necessarily or everybody and I dont put any blame on him but he seriously was unable to keep track of thoughts, I'm unsure exactly what happened but there was a really anxious situation and he thought everyone was against him and he got super hostile toward everyone in the room and he ended up projectile vomiting on the floor and just leaving the room to go lay down and at that point shit got crazy. Spencer thought somebody died and was freaking the fuck out and ended up laying down just so he could be out of this mess. In my head I was flying through other lifetimes following an energy beam, the term rolling comes to mind to perfectly describe what I was feeling I swear I lived other lives during that time frame where I was following that energy beam around, the visuals were so intense that I didnt know which reality was the real one. 
447	At that point I just decided to ride it out and see what happens, there was music playing with a good baseline in the background of the room and there was a bong being passed around but I was way too trippy to understand that. I slightly came back to reality for a second and Elliot walked over to me and lit the bong for me and man was that the most majestic thing I had ever seen, I dont know why but just that sight of him lighting that and me killing it with the bass dropping in the background was one of the most intense things I had ever felt, after I came down enough to be back in reality the vibes in the room were awesome. Landon was back and everybody was vibing and smoking bud, I had my vape out and we were chain vaping. 
448	There was a moment where randy sat next to me and tried to talk to me but I didnt notice he was in distress and now I feel bad about it because he has a negative outlook on us all. Me and jesse decided to go outside for a little bit to see what everything looked like and it was still so visually intense that it was hard to handle so we went back inside and got some drinks and chilled for a little bit. Something to know about landon is that he always just kind of has this edge to him, like hes hiding something or he has something balled up inside so I tried to talk to him about it, just to strike some good conversation and explain to him that nobody here hates him and the anxiety was just caused by him being in the middle of it. But he just wasn't having it and he thought we all hated him. He instantly showered me with hostility and the whole vibe got anxious again and it became really shitty. So me jesse and dean decided to go outside once again and just sit and chill. Dean is usually anxious in his day to day life, he expressed this to me a while back but I figured if he really wanted to trip I'd involve him in it too, but this wasnt a good plan. While we were sitting outside dean just kept being super anxious and it rubbed off on jesse pretty bad and at that point he got really scared and confused. I went back in the house and laid on the couch and watched futurama but jesse just kept going in and out of the house looking really worried about something. 
449	Eventually I came outside and saw him sitting in his car damn near to the point of tears, he needed to be home really soon but the drugs still had us both seeing so visually intense that driving would be a huge task. I tried everything I could to keep him from leaving but I know how this goes so eventually I took the plunge and stopped trying to convince him from leaving. I was really worried about jesse, I didnt want him to crash his beloved car or get a dui or even worse die, but I put my faith in him and just laid on the couch super anxious for about an hour thinking about how I'll forever have that on my conscience. I shot jesse a text at around 11am and asked if he got home alright and his exact words were yeah dude how the fuck did I not die and at the moment a huge grin hit my face and I was almost put into tears over the amount of weight that was pulled off my shoulders. 
450	Around 1 everybody was still asleep and my visuals had worn mostly off but there was still a really heavy body load and I was ready for the drugs to be gone. I hopped in my car and drove back to my house to grab a Xanax I had stashed for the purpose and popped it, about 10 minutes later I felt a lot better. After that I went to hang out with another friend of mine and we smoked a little cannabis and I went back home drank some orange juice and passed out hardcore. I slept for 18 hours but oh man did I need that. 
451	Overall my experience was good because I finally experienced ego death and saw that rolling energy I've always read about but it was super exhausting, I'm at the point where I've accomplished all I had ever hoped to accomplish on LSD and I think I'm gonna stop with it for now and explore the peaks of shrooms. Overall 10/10

453	LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
454	1355 - 3 tabs of acid for breakfast. I was in a good/happy mind when I took the 3 tabs I was sick and miserable so I might as well have fun while I am sick.
455	1430 - get home started having panic attacks/feeling happy, lay down to take a nap sleep for about 2 hours while I was having auditory hallucinations, when the fan in the room I was in vibrated weirdly. It produced a kaleidoscope fractal effect, and I was exploring the various rooms of my mind. I was talking to it the thing that makes every thing while I was exploring the rooms in my mind.
456	1630 - Don't remember much, I do remember grabbing the trash can in my bathroom. I was surrounded by darkness, I remember grabbing it. I opened my eyes to a super bright black and white flashing of nonsensical symbols with a pyramid with an eye on the left side of my vision. Lay back down. I remember feeling hot/slightly warm with my left hand feeling cold.
457	1700 - I wake up feeling terrible my whole body in pain, I drank some water and went into my sisters room. I grabbed a trash can and a fucking ice cream cone, I puked up the water I just drank then downed the ice cream cone. After I was done with it I put a cherry hard candy in my mouth and it was like tasting the color red, I bit down on it and my mouth started to hurt. This was in a red and blue haze.
458	1745 - It begins I am the master of time I could see 24 seconds into the past and the future. I eat a steak that still tasted like steak had a wierd fuzzy texture. I was in a red and blue glitch world with the ability to control time. After I was done with my steak I was waving my fork around and there was a trail coming off of it and I named it bob the trail snake and with him I started wandering around my house. I drank 1/2 a coke and I threw that up but not my steak. The coke tasted like fucking dirt.
459	1945 - Bob was gone and I was in a world of vivid colors and spaztastic rainbows. I don't remember much other then I met a dragonfly that was about 12 feet in length made of pure fucking rainbows in all of its epileptic glory. I watched some anime and played osu a rhythm game. It was like I was on adderall and snorted 4 lines of cocaine spazing out doing shit at 400 miles a second. My trip was like this for a while.
460	0300 - I finally clam my tits, I am staring at my floor rolling and shaking, I stare at it for about 30 min.
461	0330 - I cooked some macncheese because I was feeling hungry, it tasted weird somewhat like a creamy lemon flavor but wasn't unpleasant so I eat it anyways. I am feeling dirty after I ate so I decided to take a shower.
462	0400 - Shower time this was really fun the water was ticklely and felt very nice and warm I scrubbed my self and it felt very wierd like a ticklely itch. I rinsed off the soap and dried myself off.
463	0430 - I am naked and I just sit on my couch staring into the black nothingness from some reason this was very entertaining/ I decided that music would go along great with this and looked from my phone and played some jazz music. I decided that the couch was uncomfy and moved to my bed.
464	0550 - I am laying in my bed listing to jazz with a blanket over my face, I started seeing fractals again with some other weird visuals I sit there for about an hour doing this.
465	0650 - I talked about my trip with a person in a discord server I was in. At this point my trip was all but over I was still seeing some tracers and shit but other than that I was fine. I talked to him for about 2 hours.
466	0850 - He gets off and I just watch youtube videos till I stopped seeing shit. Took 2 hours.
467	1050 - I go to a store with my mom get some drinks and some gum then lay down and sleep, in my sleep I was talking to it and explored the rooms in my mind some more.

469	This past Friday I had a repeat experience that managed to stick with me when I landed. I realized it wasn't the first time, but it was the most obvious and the most...um...real.
470	I came up on two gel tabs....not a large dose by any means, but enough. I usually trip alone and I like to explore the interwebs. While typing I noticed I had, what looked like, a piece of cobweb floating from my fingers. Instinctively I reached to pull it off with my other hand. I could actually feel the sticky pull as I tried to remove it from my fingers. Unable to remove it I took a closer look and watched it disappear.
471	I know this isn't the first time I've seen these smokey tendrils attached to my fingers or arm, but it is the clearest and most real.

473	A substance(s) in this report might be identified incorrectly. Erowid reviewers question the author's identification of the drug described. Although the report is included in the collection, there are reasons to believe the substance might be something other than the author believed it to be.] 
474	It was a normal night, I was partying over at my buddy's house and we were rockin pretty hard.  Rounds and rounds of quarters and anchorman.  Lots and lots of beer and wine, plus a dance party.  This went on until about 1 am and we decided we needed more alcohol so we went to go get more.  We left with a couple of people I didn't really know well but one of them yelled out, 'Let's go get my acid!' and my eyes lit up.  I've had quite a few amazing trips from acid and it treated me well so I was down.  
475	We got to his house and he came out with a few blotter tabs.  Keep in mind I was still hammered at this point.  He then proceeded to give the hits out to each of us.  'Here's your hit, here's yours...'  I took mine and could taste the bitterness of the LSD on my paper.  This was usual but I had never tasted it this strong.  I asked him if he knew if it was dropped or dipped or what.  He said it was soaked in LSD and pretty fresh from the chemist.  I got excited and then realized it was 2:30 am.  I was like man I'm tired because I was still very drunk.  So I got dropped off at my house and fell asleep.  
476	I woke up exactly 3 hours after I took the dose.  It was 5:30 a.m. and I realized I was tripping!  Then I remembered the kid saying something repeatedly through the night...It was that the acid took 3 hours to kick in.  I walked around the house for a while and saw some crazy things.  I also watched a movie until my cousin came into the room and said she was going to work.  Then she looked at me and asked, 'why the hell are you awake?'  I told her my crazy drunken story and she said come outside we'll smoke a cig.  We did and squirrels were everywhere.  They kind of scared me a little, but they were friendly it seemed.  Then I was looking at the trees and they seemed to be smiling at me.  It was pretty wild.  
477	After tripping for many hours it became 4pm and I seemed to have come down.  It was time for me to go to work.  I smoked a joint with my bud on the way and of course, the trip came back somewhat or was prolonged.  I walked into work with this wild awareness about me.  I did really well on the phones but my cubicle was pretty wild.  The walls were definitely breathing for the most part.  Anyways, all in all, a great trip, just very strange and tired at work.  Acid can be great fun and even better if you take it at a better time than I did haha.  Trip safely and as always love and peace!!!

479	LSD is a powerful drug.  It can provide the user with invaluble insight or plunge them into the depths of insanity.  It's impossible for the first time user to know what will occur, so do not decide whether or not to use this drug lightly.  I've been lucky, and found the drug to be a window into insight.  I'd like to share my most recent experience.
480	In university, I was a borderline acidhead.  At the time of my last experience (Jan 2006), it had been four and a half years since I used the drug.  I was in the midst of some major life changes, and wanted to be able to once again analyze my life through the looking glass of LSD.
481	I dosed with M, a long time friend of mine.  Also present was D, a friend not quite a babysitter as he was smoking plenty of marijuana with us, but not joining the acid trip.  M and I dosed at 3:30pm.
482	3:30pm- We dose and take a trip to the supermarket with the currently sober D.  There are no major effects during the trip.
483	4:30pm- We are back at D's apartment, and the drug is starting to noticably create shifts in reality.  We will mostly stay at D's apartment for the remainder of the trip.  Although I used to enjoy the roving, unpredictable acid trip, I now wish for a comfortable environment to explore innerspace.
484	5:00pm- I'm busy ripping CD's into mp3's when my attention span allows (I was soon to move overseas and wanted to bring my music on a hard drive).  We end up puttin on the Boards of Canada 'Campfire Headphase' disc, which creates an ocean of sonic space for our acid fried minds.  D is now smoking from his bong, and we are happy to join him.  We play a few games of Fireball Island (children of the 80's might know this) and Texas Hold Em'.  Although we are able to stay within the parameters of the games,  there are quite a few verbal tangents and side trips.
485	5:30pm- We all share some strange threats and confusing words in the kitchen.  It's all in jest, but even this could throw a more unstable mind or first-time user into a state of panic (aka the bad trip).  We get past it and break out the 40 year old scotch.  Of course it burns, but the ambient flavors shine through the lysergic prism.
486	6:00pm- I put on an episode of 'The Flash.'  Unfortunately, no one really wants to join me through my nostalgiac flight of fancy (in other words, they hate it).  I still dig it.
487	7:00pm- M and I are reaching our peak.  D is preperly stoned.  We get into some music videos.  The Chris Cunningham clips (especially my first viewing of Aphex Twin's 'Windowlicker') create a disturbing view of the world.  I prefer the Michel Gondry clips with their fractal view of the world.
488	7:30pm- M throws 'San Andreas' into the X-Box.  It's a fine game, but I don't really think it finds the unique experience of LSD.  Nevertheless, we take turn playing it for the next 45 minutes and immerse ourselves in the video world.
489	8:30pm- D is feeling sober enough to take us on a group trip to the Arby's drive though.  It's a typical enough experience, but M and I are still having a very strange time.
490	9:00-11:00pm- Although most of the time dilation occurred earlier in the evening, this is where things become a blur.  The hours are filled with video games, music, Texas Hold Em', and Poker, but I can't recall the quantities or order.
491	11:00pm-12:30am- I'm back to ripping CDs as I wait to sober up.  Everyone's energy is waning.
492	12:30am- I'm sober enough to drive so I take M home and head to my own place.  The LSD is very clean and I'm able to sleep by 2am.  The next day I was perfectly fine with no hangover.
493	Final thoughts-  Unfortunately, I feel I missed some of the insight that I found on earlier trips.  Maybe this was because I arranged such a comfortable time for us all.  My most profound trip was on a camping trip about 5 years ago.  Still, it was a very enjoyable time and I hope it's not my last LSD experience.

497	In a flashing spell of lingering interior flailing bursts, you remain ignorant to a falling corpse of bleeding lizard dreams. It will blind you, I warn, in a second that tears at your senses like the unending sorrow that bursts you with a flavor of the sounds of a pathetic giggling moose country wizard. It comes from the direction of the deranged infinitely screaming reaper who supervises the stimuli of existence. It overwhelms you; the mind piercing pink and orange exploding from his mouth tastes like a photon blast from hell. Then you fall into a frantic steam of euphoria that tickles at your legs and leads its way back to your brain only to wisp in the frolicking cob webs of your past. The browning shrimp gumbo gives way to the sense of emprisonment the redbird once felt when his feathers were trapped in a sling. Freedom you thought you experienced is now a summit of yellow pleasure the ever famous mockingbird intertwines within your being, and the ever slowly descending popcorn wave is a sea in the eyes of a corn field reaper.

499	LSD (2) : Unknown Context (20), Poetry (43), General (1)
500	I actually tried LSD several times before the EVENT I am about to descibe (which was on 3-28-89 at the Omni in Atlanta- just looked up the exact date AND setlist on the internet, pretty cool) and even though a few friends and I had experienced some pretty wild things during our frequent acid trips during my 'crazy' college days of 1984-88 this one sticks out in my mind as the 'Big One.' Because Jerry Garcia died in 1995 making it impossible to attend a Dead show as so many did I have fond memeories of the few shows I did make it to, but as far as this acid trips go, this one was diferent because I had never experienced the truly powerful energy being spread around by the thousands of people (all ages although mostly young adults) who were either tripping along with me or were at least very receptive to feelings I was having on acid that I would normally hide
501	unless in a 'safe' area- Not a concert hall! Anyway, I will start at the beginning...
502	My friend had some great acid that I had tried once before when we camped on Cumberland Island. That was a very cool trip when we climbed over a tall fence and sat around in a private cemetery trying to 'come down' before walking on the beautiful unspoiled beach looking at seashells and basically appreciating nature at its finest. That had been only a few weeks before this concert, still in March, which in Georgia usually means great weather. I had been to see the Grateful Dead years before while still in high school and hadn't even gotten drunk before, so all I did was stare at all the strange looking people and hoped the band would play Truckin' or one of the other few songs I would recognize. Now, in March of 1989, I had tripped first on mushrooms then acid several times and knew just about every Grateful Dead song there was (I thought) so was truly pumped up for this concert!
503	My friend and I got to downtown Atlanta at least two hours before the concert so we could check out 'the scene' which was fun- lots of strangely dressed people roaming about but even before we 'dosed' I thought the energy level was positive and attractive. We took the public tranportation (MARTA) which ended up being smart, more on that later. We ate in a chinese restaurant and must have already sampled the two hits (one each) because I remembe rthings getting strange there because the restaurant was crowded with young people in tie-died t-shirts, etc. making the chinese waiters a little uncomfortable. We passed many more dead-heads and all the interesting things to look at, again the dead-heads, made the awkward 'early acid feelings' almost unnoticeable. Standing in line outside of the Omni became intense cause there was a guy beating a loud drum to a slow beat, making me nervous and letting me know that a strong trip was on the way.
504	By the time we slowly entered the 'arena,'  bought a beer, actually found our row (which we found out later didn't matter) the music had already started. Near the aisles were young girls who stood up as the music played and started whirling around with trance-like faces. They scared me! We gave up trying to find our actual seats after both of us were fully tripping now and could have fallen down the stone steps. Counting the numbers of the rows with the blasting music was too much! The Dead finished 'Let the Good Times Roll' which seemed so-o-o appropriate to the way we were feeling! After settling into some chairs, I somehow was able to talk a little to a pretty woman next to me. She had a beautiful smile and after telling me she flew in THAT DAY from Dallas to Atlanta pulled out a large joint and offered to share it with me!
505	My friend declined saying he was tripping too hard and didn't need anything to increase the strong buzz. I, however, smoked the whole joint with her and noticed that YES smoking pot while tripping can increase your buzz. I started to regret what I had done during a few of the songs, but when the band luanched into 'Ramble On Rose' I sang along and felt happy again. I remember seeing Jerry Garcia's smiling face during the silly song 'Don't Ease Me In' as if I was staring at someone a few feet away and I got a warm feeling in my heart that all what would be great.
506	The first set abruptly ended and strong, piercing lights flashed into our eyes. Suddenly the goddess next to me did not seem approachable and I flet like an utter fool. It was cruel to interupt the darkness and a most difficult time to get adjusted to the sudden freedom of having to find something to do until the second set began.
507	I remember wandering around being lost by the loud chatter that was everywhere. I was tripping hard! The second set eventually ended up being great. We moved around during the show a few times, not caring if we could see the stage, just wanting to be able to hear the music and stare at the wonderful colored lights. Truly psychedilic! The most memorable song was 'Playing in the Band' which lasted the longest and was fantastic with the long jamming. At the end of the concert, the mass of people leaving or being in utter confusion like us was overwhelming. We managed to get into a taxi and leave worry free while freakish young people stared into the window, scaring me. The atxi driver commented on the odd-looking people, not knowing that we were not dressed as strangely but were veyr much par tof that scene! 
508	My trip by the way had only icreased for three hours! I was still not even peaking! This experience taught me that acid is unpredicatable in the amount of time trips peak, last, etc. This one was intensified because of the atmosphere. When we were away from the concert experience, my peak finally leveled out and except for a weird feeling in my throat and some weird visuals, I managed to slowly come down and enjoy the experience, knowing it would only be a 'normal'  trip for the next three or four hours.
509	We went out to eat after my friend was able to drive and sat at a restaurant listening to the loud but somehow pleasant noise of the busy street nearby. I was in a blissful state when a passing car threw a beer bottle that only missed my head by inches. It could have been a diaster! But like many of my experiences, it LUCKILY turned out differently. MAY ALL OF YOU FIND INNER-PEACE AND HAVE SUCH LUCK!

511	LSD (2) : General (1), Music Discussion (22), Festival / Lg. Crowd (24)
512	August 2002, the night was young, people partying having a good time. Some one approaches, 'hey you want to split a half hit of acid?' I think to myself, not really, but I want to stay in the same mind set as my boyfriend. My boyfriend takes the hit and rips it in half, eats one half and hands me the other. My worst mistake ever. 
513	The night goes well, I had a fantastic time, and was able to sleep soundly when I wanted to. Next morning as I lifted my head off the couch images of the whole room moved along with my eyes. I shook my head, rubbed my eyes, and the first thing I say to myself is 'oh shit.' I've heard of 'permanant' trips happening to people, but I never really knew what that actually meant. I never thought it would happen to me. I had no clue of what was going on with myself. I kept seeing things move, people that weren't really there, objects appearing really close to my face or extreamly far away, colors, what's happening? 
514	A month later I was visiting with my parents, the psychosis started slowly; little things like forgetting where I put things, deep vivid daydreaming that I almost couldn't wake up from, then the voices started. I could hear people say my thoughts, the madness of voices in my head, slowly I couldn't recognize my own family and had involuntary movements of my arms. During a lucid moment I told my parents I needed to go to the hospital. At that time the hallucinations were so intense, I'd see snakes crawling all over me, worry that I had bugs (I really didn't), the maddening voices, the constant movement of things around me, it was pure hell. Doctors put me on strong medicine that did not stop the hallucinations but weakend my ability to feel anything emotionally, shutting down all my thoughts. I started noticing if I was in a good mood the hallucinations would be silly causing me to laugh, but if I was in a bad mood I was in for a really rough time.
515	Through time I have learned to live with this monster. It's been a year now of constant hallucinating. The hallucinations are not as intense as they first were. I still see people that are not there (I paint clown faces on them now), colors, mainly black, go zooming past my eyes, spheres or balls pass from one hand to the other and into other people's hands, balls of light bounce off of people's heads,almost like a thin layer peeled off of actual people in front of me follow wherever I look, images jump out at me, and when really stressed or over stimulated the voices come back. It's not fun, it's just something I've become accustomed to, and it has improved greatly in the past year. From what I've read this could last 5 years (4 more to go), or permenantly, I pray almost every night and hope that when I wake up in the morning the monster will be gone. Needles to say I do not use drugs or alcohol any more. I was an active addict for 15 years. This has scared me straight. The end.

518	I was able to come across some very potent acid and having had the same stuff before I bought three. I knew this stuff was good but I had no idea how hard it would hit me. My drug background goes as follows, I've had Shrooms, Acid, 5Meo, Salvia, Cocaine, MDMA, and of course MJ. 
519	I decided to take the sacrement at 7:30am so I could have the house to myself all day. After dosing I took a shower because I prefer to at least start out clean, when I trip. After the shower I was just chillin in my bed listening to some trance on the headphones. This went on until about 11:00. This far in I was beginng to get disappointed because even though I was definitly tripping I didn't feel as though I was peaking. My opinion is that it was due to the music choice. I went outside for a cigarette and my mind started thinking in a different pattern. Before I was more focused on the music by being outside and veiwing nature I began to start thinking about my spiritual beliefs amungst other things. This was a time in my life when I was very unsure about my beliefs. This didn't go on too long before I went inside to my room. I turned on some Grateful Dead  which sounded absolutly wonderful. The music moved me and before I knew it I was dancing around the room. I felt as though I was the visualizer for the music. This was odd since it is unheard of that I dance. At this point I knew I was peaking and opted to lay down on the bed. It was about 12:30. I began to focus on an abject in my room. Let me describe the object as best I can. The base is a cone, and at the tip are four skinny arms that are bent in a certain way. These arms are all different colors, blacklight responsive, and they spin around in different directions. However, the design is perfect because I have found that even when not triping I can see the visuals it makes. Anyway the arms began to move off of their designed trajectories. It looked as though some where falling down, and then it would zoom right back up. After this it transformed in a way and instead the arms looked like they were moving up towards the cieling. Like ribbons of color ascending into the sky. As this was happening the beginning heartbeats of Darkside of the moon began to play. And then, in that instant, the entire room took on a new perspective. It was as if a new connection was made inside the supercomputer that is my brain. Like a light switch flicking on my entire field of vision engulfed in visuals at the instant the music on the first track of darkside hits. Having experienced ego loss prior to this I recognized it instantly. My walls began to glimmer as though they were made of bricks of gold. In my window curtain, I saw Timothy Leary's face smiling back at me as if to say, 'There ya go, now ya got it.'  For the entire album of darkiside of the moon I was transcendent. Many, many visions appeared to me, all with my eyes open. The visions were on the curtains and the walls, and the floor, and anything else in my view. The amazing thing was that all the visuals seemed more realistic than most visuals.  Bright white light shone through the wall straight into my eye. It felt as though it was the awesome power of God.  He comforted me, and reassured me that my way of life was rightous. I understood the mind doesn't need our clunky bodies to survive. It has everything it needs to live on in the afterlife. After that I remained in this heavenly place looking down upon the people of earth with more knowledge of life than I had ever thought concievable. The music brought up topics such as money. I began to understand that Gov't and society was a huge joke. I was shown many more images, however some of which are deeply personal and others I have not fully understood yet. The state of transcendance lasted until the last note of Darkside. I was thrown back into my body on earth and at that moment there was a laughter in the music and I began to laugh as well.

522	Well. I took acid on sat and I went insane. Then I took it again on thurs and went even more insane.
523	The day started off in Brooklyn, we were having fun, alot of people I knew. Abuot 15 in all. At least half of them were tripping, probably more. We walked around and smoked and the street started getting really cartoony.  Then the other group of people went off to smoked their blunt and we went to smoke ours. Even though were all friends they just wandered off. 
524	We smoked, and came back to my friends house. I was tripping nicely. We put on floyd. This would be one of my most insane experiances ever. After a while I was really getting into the floyd and they re-went out to smoke again. I opted to stay and listen to floyd in the warmth...... by myself. Big mistake/but crazy journey. After a while i was completely swallowed by the floyd and I was bugging, I never felt so aware or able to control reality. The walls were moving, the music was part of me and went exactly with it. 
525	Finally the CD ended. I was completely lost. I wasn't able to comprehend how the music could have stopped. I took out the cd and sat there feeling like a part of me had just been lost bugging out. I started to pace the room and talk to myself for 15 mins. Then I was I need the floyd and tried to get it to work again. I put the cd in and couldn't find the play buttong so i just started pushing all the buttons on the stereo. I couldn't get the damn thing to play. I was tripping balls. I started asking the cd to play itself, trying to cajole it into playing for me. Then I was like ok, Im tripping balls, But there are a limited amount of buttons, i can do this. After another 5 minutes of intense analysis and and examination, and attempting to comprehend my loss, I found the button and was like ahhhhh im back. Then everyone came back, but I wasn't sure if they existed or not. And i wasn't trusting myself to interact with them, I felt like I had been through this insane trip and couldn't possibly even relate to them. 
526	After a while of listening to them talk, (while I was still tripping) VOOSH, my whole environment changed, and they turned into weird things that were still breathing and talking but some where not human. Greg turned into a chameleon, Hunts was a Big stone human, these girls were sea creatures with flowing green hair, at that point people were trying to interact with me, and every now and then I wouild respond or give them the thumbs up to allay their fears. Then the other group came back and I was still tripping. The feeling I had been feeling before was soo intense I refused to let it go. Then Stew brought me back after a couple rounds of foosball, which he single handedly was owning me and Alex combined. L also helped to bring me back with his girlfriend by just talking to me and stuff. We went back to the room and I was stilll tripping. 
527	My hand all of a sudden got crazy i dont even know how to describe it except it started opening in a weird weird way. Like one finger would move in a tiny jerk which would be followed by another one and so on. But it took a while for it to open completely, I was still feeling crazy, people were looking at my hand going holy shit, he's gone insane. I dont remember most of the rest of the night, But eventually me and a couple of friends went on the train home. The train was soo trippy, whenever it would start slowing down it would make crazy tripped out noises like voosh coom wowr. I cant really type it, its like those crazy noises that synthesisers make when slowing down and speeding up. I got home at like 11:30 cz we took the cid mid day or early afternoon. I fell asleep at 6 in the morning. I was still feeling it a little throught the whole night.

529	LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
530	For a while I had been wanting to trip because of all the stuff i heard about it. None of my friends liked tripping but i was not convinced. One a saturday night, my friend and i went to the Rocky Horror picture show, mainly because i wanted to sell some ecstacy i had. I ended up traded two rolls for a little baggie. In the baggie was supposevely acid. They looked like little purple insect legs. I do not remeber what they were called, but they said they were the cuttings left over from the sheet of gels or something. I was doubtful but trusting because it was my friend's boyfriend. We went out back and she put two of the bug-looking legs on my tongue. They tasted kinda strange. I let them dissolve and we went on with our night.
531	About 40 minutes later we decided to walk to the graveyard, but halfway there we decided to change our minds. As we walked back, i saw two cats and i pursued them. As i walked toward them, i heard a strange noise from the gutter. ( i later found out it was a frog croaking.) it scared the crap out of me and i ran off giggling insanely. i was convinced there was a monster in the gutter. the other girl that was with us began croaking and i began laughing in hysterics. By this time i knew it was kicking in.  They went back to get some ecstacy from someone while i wandered around. everything was strange and new. someone approached me wanting to buy a roll. but the strangest thing happened. i couldnt get it out of my wallet. everytime i opened my wallet, it was a confusion of colors and madness. i threw the wallet down on the ground. i couldnt understand why i couldnt get it out. luckily, my friend found the roll and my wallet. then we went n a car ride. 
532	i was by the window. looking out the window was the strangest thing that i had ever seen. the driver had put some trance on. when walked around on clematis for a while and by this time i was real messed up.  my mind was wandering. colors swirling in and out. tall buildings and trees were amazingly impressive. when we got back to rocky, we wrnt to the park ad i saw the most beautiful tree i had ever seen in my life. i decided to sit in it. by this time my friends were rolling and quite worried about me wandering off. We went back to rocky and actually went in the theater. what happened was amazing. the input to my brain was overwhelming. all the sounds, the sights, everything. then we went to IHOP. we went into the bathroom, and my pupils were quite large. i couldnt help staring at the stalls. they were the most beautiful shade of purple i had ever seen in my life.  strange rainbow patters, like a metal grid, covered everything. we got a ride home from the most beautiful guy i had ever seen in my life, and i was quite in love with him. when we got home it was about 4:30 AM. One of my friends who was rolling, had some shrooms. we then decided to go outside and explore. 
533	we decided to go to the community pool, but we never made it. everyfew steps or so, we would get distracted by something. then i noticed her face. it looked so strange. her eyes were morphing and her face just looked so weird. we were out side for an hour, wandering around. then we went inside and watched the Matrix. it was amazing. I was convinced the guy who wrote the script was tripping. It made perfect sense. After the movie was over, I was convinced i was in the matrix, I ran around screaming, 'there is no spoon!' i really was convinced. suddenly, i was ravenously hungry. i grabbed a sprite and ran into my friends room. 'orange.....AMBIVALENCE!' i said, and we all giggled. i didnt end up opening the can of sprite for about an hour.
534	afer that we sat on the floor for hours recalling all our memories. it was the most fun i had in my entire life and i would definately do it again. everything was so beautiful to me. it was the most amazing experience in my life and i believe i learned alot from it, just about how beautiful life is. 
535	unfortunately two days later i got extremely sick and vomited for two days straight, but that always happens to me when i try  a new drug. that will not prevent me from trying it again. it was totally different from what i expected, and anyone who wants to see the beauty in life should definately try it.

537	This is the story of my latest trip, which occured tonight and continues as I write this. I am 16 years old.
538	I went to a friend's house this evening at about five o'clock. There, I dropped three hits of white blotter that remained from 20 I'd bought a few weeks before. I went with two of my friends to a restaurant, where I drank water and had nothing to eat.
539	At around 6:30, I started getting the familiar queasiness in my stomach, but decided not to tell my friends yet. I went into the bathroom and looked at my pupils, and they were really big by this time. We wandered around a while, and they had a cigarette, before we decided to walk to our high school football game. We paid, went in, and sat down with some of my other friends. I immediately noticed the full moon, and the clouds that sometimes covered it.
540	Throughout the game, I would notice the moon and its position in the sky. I talked to my friends for a while, and they still did not know I was definitely feeling the acid. I talked to one of them about the fourth dimension, and how difficult it is to comprehend something like that, even though it must exist (for reference, look up 'Flatland' and read it...insane).
541	The moon, meanwhile, crawled across the sky, and it sometimes appeared as if someone had taken a huge eraser and smeared the moon's color across the black sky. By 8:30 or so, my friends knew I was tripping, because I said something about the huge dragon around the moon. We started discussing the Pillsbury Doughboy and how it would be funny if, instead of saying 'Whoo-hoo!' when you poked his stomach, he said 'Fuck you!' This conversation lasted until halftime, when the two friends I arrived with left (one has a curfew with his probation, and the other wanted to go home). I found a glowrod lying on the ground. I played with this and talked to some other people, and occasionally watched the game. The moon continued to creep and bleed across the sky, and shine its bright yellow light through the clouds.
542	At around 10 o'clock, I went with a different friend to the dance, because the game had ended. I took my trusty glowrod, and took off my shoes. In the gym, I talked to many people and continued to twirl the glowrod. Its mystical green light entranced me, and my friend decided it was time to leave. I had thought we had been there about five minutes, but it was actually more like 45. We left, got in the car, and cruised around looking for a party. I was content to sit and listen to selected tracks from Tool, Sublime, and some other groups I can't recall now.
543	We found a party: unfortunately, it sucked, so we left. I don't remember whether I even got out of the car or not, but we went to Wendy's and three of the five people got Frostys. We then drove back to the same party, and saw some people we knew, when some old guy told us we had to leave because we were blocking the cul-de-sac or something. Once more, we got into the car, and drove to one other place where a party was supposed to be. There was nothing there, so I was brought home at about 11:30. I talked to my mom for a while (which is always cool and scary at the same time), and then I watched some television. I had a Hotpocket and a Coke, which was the first thing I had eaten since about noon.
544	I am now sitting here writing this, and I enjoyed my evening thoroughly.

546	I first became interested in LSD when I accidently stumbled across an LSD article in the dentist's waiting room.  The article told briefly of the commonly experienced psychadelics of LSD.  I had never really given LSD a second thought in the past, but after cross-examining it I felt as if I was missing out on something.  I decided to start researching the drug and also contacted a few individuals that I knew had used LSD.  
547	I've always been a very careful person when in comes to foreign chemicals.  I would always research a drug thoroughly, seeking both users' and non-users' facts and opinions. After about 3 months of bi-daily research, I had decided I had read virtually every information-bearing LSD website I could find. Thus I decided I was informed enough to ensure safety and enjoyability in my experience.  I went about obtaining some LSD by contacting a friend that I knew had used it in the past, and we planned a trip.  My first LSD trip took place at his house, in which I ingested one sugar cube, and acheived somewhat of a trip.  I was extremely giddy, and the experience as a whole was extremely positive. Unfortunately, the more cosmic, psychadelic effects that I'd expected were absent.
548	The only hallucinations I experienced, besides the shadow of a branch that I saw as Medusa, were images I conciously manifested with my own imagination.  One of such images were a 'lizard man', a velociraptor with knee joints as humans, that was cloaked and squatting in the corner, flicking his tounge fiercly at me.  Once I manifested the image and it was in my vision, I felt an evil presence.  However, I quickly snapped out of this by reassuring myself that the drug had surely induced the vision. Even though I'd say that the hallucinations were enough to tell about, I didn't experience the complete alteration of time, space, matter, and thought that I hoped for.  I wondered if I didn't take enough LSD, and I presumed that perhaps I was more resistant to the drug than other people.  I decided on trying it again, this time from a different person and in a different form.   
549	I decided that the way I could acheive the trip I wanted was through more potent form of LSD.  Many people have told me their non-convincing experiences with paper-form LSD, and I decided I had to investigate for myself.  A few months after the first experience, I obtained 4 paper hits, and with my friend, took 2 each.  The effects were very familiar to the first trip.  Once again, I was giddy but no significant mild-alteration was present.  Just when I was ready to give up the quest for psychadelics my friend found another form.  He had met somebody, and he had obtained a few geltabs, thin squares of gelatin spotted with LSD.  I was given another hope.  We called another friend, and planned a trip.  It was to take place in some campgrounds we were to soon visit, a nice place with all the conveniences of the city (fresh water, heat, air condition) and all the wonders of nature.  It was surrounded by woods and a nice pond was nearby the house area.
550	When the time came, it was me and my two friends, D and F.  I chose not to use their names because I haven't informed them of my plans to document the trip.  We had 4 yellow geltabs, and decisively distributed them among us.  Since F had never done LSD before, he would take 1, and me and D would take 1 1/2 each, us having some LSD experience.  We decided to go inside and play cards while waiting for the wonders to come.  After about 30-45 minutes of cards, I began to feel the same effects as my first two trips.  I looked at the clock, thinking at least an hour had passed, but was wrong.  I was roughly 35 minutes into the trip, and already was lost in thought.  It was if every thought would start a chain reaction in my head, activating more and more thoughts to the point that I was pondering several very different topics at one time. About 1 hour into the trip, playing cards became extremely difficult, as I was being bombarded by abstract and fragmented thoughts and ideas.  With all that was going on in my head, the last thing I was thinking about were the cards in my hand.  Giving my hand to F, I decided to sit and try to calm my brainstorm restfully.  
551	I was only resting for about 10 seconds before I caught some movement in the corner of my eye.  I saw the ceiling moving, taking on a flowing form, as if it was silk being blown by the wind.  Being the first visuals I had ever experienced, I was awe-stricken.  I sat and watched the movement spread onto more surfaces, noticing that the movement was stronger whenever I looked. I could see movement in the corner of my eye, but only when I looked directly at something would it shift and dance. After staring at the floor for several minutes, I decided to return to my friends.  'D,' I said. 'Are you feeling anything?' He gave me a blank look and cracked a smile at me.  His pupils, almost completely dominating the blue of his eyes, were all I needed to see. 
552	It had only been a little over an hour, and we were all tripping.  We decided to take a walk outside, to see the newfound wonders of the surrounding area, despite the fact that it was around 10:00pm and very dark. We walked through a dimly lit path in the woods, and each tree we passed seemed characterized.  I felt as if I was walking among strangers, but an easy, relaxed feeling took over.  Despite the fact that I was walking into the dark woods, under the influence of a drug I had little grasp on, I didn't have an ounce of fear in me.  'Is it just me, or are these trees covered with a dark blue fog.' D said. I stopped and looked up at the treetops.  Among the almost pitch black treetops I saw beautiful patterns forming and changing, becoming more complex every second.  D was talking to me, but I didn't notice. I was awe-stricken.  
553	A tap on my shoulder got me out of the trance.  I turned around, and looked at D and F behind me.  It was extremely dark, and I tried to focus on their faces, but it was not their faces that I saw when I squinted at their extremely dimly lit heads.  As their faces came into view, they started taking on an evil, monster-like characteristic. I immediately thought back to reports I've previously read that described panic attacks upon seeing drug-induced and negative hallucinations. I told myself that it was impossible for them to be anything other than D and F, and despite what I saw I disregarded this and suggested we go back inside. We walked back inside, and upon arriving at the house I was overcome with another relaxing sensation.  I sat down on the couch, and was put into a  kind of a trance. 
554	As I sat and pondered the situation, one thought branched into a chain of thoughts, followed by another branch of thoughts, and was thrown into a series of mental visualizations that simply blew my mind. I had a similar experience after eating 225 Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds and smoking cannabis about 3 hours later, 2 after my stomach rejected the seeds.
555	'Lets go to the pond.' I suggested.  A quick walk through the woods would get us to our destination, a shining mirage of paradise in the moonlit night.  I visualized the pond. I saw the bright moon shining on the water, its sandy, beach-like shore (only on one side of the lake), and benches on the sand to relax on.  I smiled. 'Let's go.' We skipped over to D's care and extracted a few bowls of cannabis from his bag and headed blindly into the woods. We made our way through the woods, and upon doing this I noticed patterns on everything, and forming out of everything.  The leaves on the ground formed patterns, and the clouds in the sky formed patterns.  It was amazing.  I was busy staring at the pattern, and we got there quicker than I expected.  
556	I looked out at the lake, and sure enough, the moon lit up everything.  The reflection of the moon on the pond was shifting and moving. We walked over to a bench and sat down. D pulled out an 'irish' pipe and a bag of pot, and lit it accordingly. I took a couple of hits, and it wasn't until about 1 minute later that the peaking effects of the LSD returned in full effect.  I noticed the colors of the leaves on the ground melt together, the intense and rapid thought process returned. It took me by surprise, for part of the reason I wanted to smoke was that I suspected the LSD was wearing off.  I was mistaken however, because now I realize that they effects hadn't wore off at all, as if I was still on the trip's plateau.  I was only getting used to effects of the LSD... becoming accustommed to the moving surfaces and not thinking of it as abnormal.  I recognized how this could potentionally permanently damage my thinking process, and paid more attention to the psychadelia.
557	I stood there for a couple of minutes, trying to remember the sequence of events preceeding the present time.  It was then I remembered I had a few 'Sparklers' in my pocket.  Sparklers are fireworks... you light the end of the long metal stick and sparks spew out of it for about 1 minute.  I pulled a Sparkler out, and lit it.  It took a few seconds to light, but once lit immediately exploded into a rage of sparks intensified by my hallucinations.  As I moved it around my vision, tracers followed it in a very flowy motion, and the path of the sparkler in my vision was revealed until the sparkler went out.  When it went out, my heart was racing.  I was amazed.  I turned around and looked at D and F, who were also left silent by the beautiful display of colors.  I lit a few more, and we smoked another bowl before heading back inside.
558	The walk back was similar to the other treks through the dark woods. Everything I could see was a part of a beautiful pattern. D and F also saw patterns. Upon returning to the house, we all agreed that 4:00am was a reasonable time to go to sleep.  We went to bed, and though I'm still unsure whether they managed to go to sleep, I was in a complete state of insomnia.  I laid in bed for an hour or so before the effects of the pot took its toll on me and I passed out.
559	I hope this report shines some light on the LSD experience, as reports submitted before mine helped me to better understand something I had no knowledge of. I believe that knowledge and preparedness are essential when it comes to hallicunagenic experimentation.

562	I thought I'd like to share this experiance as it was so clear and amazingly real.
563	A beautiful still fullmoon night, myself and friend Marty planned to take a little of some recently aquired LSD. We had been told it was very clean and fresh.
564	I road my pushbike to M's house at dusk and watched the huge moon rise over suburban Melbourne. We had decided to take the acid and then rehearse a few songs until it came on. It didn't take long before my hands became disengaged from my mind and magical vistas began to appear behind my eyes. The rehearsal was over.
565	We retired to the lounge room for a beer and a smoke. I was feeling wonderful as we sat chatting about state of the world. We seemed to be in some mutal blissed 'love's the answer, love's the question' headspace. M talked his brother's suicide, and showed emotions I had never seen in him before. While this conversion was going on I noticed distortions in his face, I had seen these before when we had tripped on previous occasions and I always looked away as I thought it was some sort of sickness. But this time I concentrated on his face as his nose and chin grew into a gargoyle-like mask.
566	As we continued to talk this mask took on even more hidious looking features (classic gargoyle and ghoul archtypes)until it reach the point where it was nearly impossible to look at. M's face was at a profile to me but these other ghoulish faces continued to look at me from out of the side of his head. Then he turned to face me and his eyes and the eyes of these hideous gargoyles became one. I was staring directly into his eyes and then room exploded into green and all I could see were his eyes in a thick green fog. I remember thinking then that his eyes were the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.
567	Then the green mist cleared and M had turned into a leprechaun and was lying in a field of mushroons. He was about 3 feet long with a long wispy red beard, large pointy ears, a little green hat, green suit and pointy shoes with buckles. Here I was sitting in the room with a beer talking with a leprechaun as real as the day was long. Then he began changing again first into a camouflaged, pointy eared earth warrior and then a parade of what was literally thousands of faces, pirates with eye patches, old black women and everything else in between. During this whole time we continued rapping.
568	It was a truely magical trip and we gently came down over a few beers and joints. I felt truly privileged to have seen what I believe was my friends spirit. I had never beleived that I would ever in this life see a leprechaun, now I know one who lives just down the road.
569	Thanks for opportunity to tell my little story.

571	My girlfriend and I elected to have our own little New Years 2K party by tripping our brains out in a nearby hotel. We succeeded, using a total of six hits of acid, splitting them between us. 
572	I had tripped a few times, but all at lower dosages (one or two hits), so was pretty prepared for an interesting experience. We downed one hit, with 1000mg of Vitamin C (I still don't know if it more greatly potentiates an experience, but it seemed to help.), waited one hour, and then downed hit #2, with another 1000mg of Vit. C. During this time, we had turned off all the lights in the room, lit a number of candles (most in hurricane glass - highly recommended) and relaxed.
573	About an hour later, we were feeling the first two hits, VERY speedy, but OK.. and elected to imbibe the third hit, too. This particular batch of LSD-25 seemed to hit after about two hours, peak after about 4, and fade around 9 hours.
574	We were already having very trippy psycholitic [sic] reactions (breathing ceiling, weird stucco, 3-D effects from the wallpaper edging, aural distortions from the Enigma and Deep Forest we were listening to), and proceeded to have delightful but not overly ecstatic sex. :) 
575	Time passed, first watching VERY awful but amusing porn on the hotel Spanktrovision, then with her painting watercolors and me waxing philosophically. The third hit was coming along well, and, after she showered, I was feeling frisky, so we had sex again.
576	Oh my god. :) We had complete ego dissolution, and the best sex I've ever had. I came five times, something I hadn't expected was even physiologically possible. She was getting fantastic synesthesia, seeing splashes of color with every touch and caress, while I was in the midst of watching our loveplay sort of in slow motion, floating between being in my body, and loving her, and climaxing, and floating back out of myself while we continued to make love very swiftly and ecstatically.
577	There was a lot of teeth clenching and a fair amount of paranoia (on my part), but the latter is normal for me with more than one hit. Teeth clenching seemed most treatable using 'Mixed Fruit MENTOS' -- but they taste awful. 'You think you want one, and you put the Mentos in your mouth, but by then, the Mentos has used you for its' purposes.' But they crunch well. I had massive synesthesia on one, with sounds happening, instead of tasting the Mentos 'goodness'. (yecch) 
578	Star Trek: The Next Generation 'The Best of Both Worlds' was on, and I mused how cheesy the Borg costumes were -- but still kind of spooky. I mused 'That must be when they know to stop spending money on effects. 'Don't spend more, sir -- it's good enough to fool the acidheads.'' 
579	There were some setting issues, due to a recent death in her family, but I was feeling very empathic, and we talked, and cried, and it was a very wonderful, bonding, and flat out fun experience. Sleep was VERY hard to obtain, even 17 hours after the first hit, but it finally came. 
580	Now if only LSD weren't so hard to come by here lately :)

583	  I never used to have dreams until I started using LSD.  It's been about a month since I first tripped and have done it a few more time since.  EVERY single night when I go to bed, I've had a very memorable, vivid dream.  I  love it.  I even look forward to going to bed because I know I'll visit some entirely new world when I'm sleeping.  None of the dreams are nightmares either.

585	I have done acid before, but never this much. Actually, the last time i dropped i only did 2 hits and this time i dropped 5 hits, which is a huge step up.
586	0:20 - get a slight body high and lights seem to get brighter than normal
587	1:00 - everything has become very distorted, there are patterns all over whatever i look at
588	1:30 - here comes the peak, having a conversation is simply impossible, the concept of a phone completely escapes me, time has dwindled to almost non-existence, and the patterns are even stronger and i have some long ass trails. i don't even have to unfocus my eyes
589	2:00 - it feels like i am in a movie, out-of-body type feelings, and the feeling that anything i do right now doesn't matter, i can not hear anything except for what is in the room and what i do hear is accompanied by echos, or when my friends try to talk they sound almost like computers
590	2:30 - my senses are being completely switched around, like if my hearing is gone i would be able to feel what my girlfriend is saying or see it.  And the times that i can see the patterns and trails are even stronger
591	6:00 - the effects start to wear off but i don't come all the way down until 10 the next morning, and all day today my brain has felt completely fried. but overall, i had a wonderful time and it didn't feel like a bad trip at any time.  i personally thought it was better than rolling, which most people wouldn't agree with but then again, i am a little weird.

593	After reading on the internet and talking to people who've done it before, my girlfriend and I decided to trip for the first time.  We picked up 2 hits of blotter for free because I ran a couple errands for the kid I was supposed to buy it from.  So, we went back to her house and ate some McDonald's and ingested the paper.  About 20 minutes in, it began to feel like we got ripped off, so we smoked a bowl and began to watch 'The Green Mile.'  About 1 hour into the experience I began to feel very, very anxious about something, but I couldn't figure out what it was.  Everything seemed weird, out of the ordinary.  So, we continued to watch the movie and I caught my first visual in the part where the black prisoner coughed up the bee/wasp things.  It looked like they came right out of the TV and flew past me.  It was quite cool.  I also noticed that the color on the TV, mainly people's skin, was extremely bright, glowing even.  After that it seemed like I stopped tripping until about three hours later, when a friend came over.  He saw the size of my pupils and decided to play with my head for a little bit.  He kept lighting a lighter by his face, and it was extremely amusing.  Then he tried to make it look like he was going to kick me.  He was across the room and I swear I thought he was going to hit me right in the face.  I freaked out and started jumping around covering myself screaming!  When I realized what I was doing, I found it extremely hilarious and cracked up.  I laughed so hard that tears were streaming down my face.  After I calmed down, I got kinda hungry.  I was leaving at 10:30 and it was 9:00, so I wanted something quick and easy.  I don't remember how it happened, but somehow we ended up making spaghetti.  After I ate, my mom came and got me and I went home and just slept.  I remember I couldn't concentrate on one thought the whole night.  I felt if I did I would go insane.  I also couldn't keep my fingers out of my mouth.  
594	Overall, I wouldn't say that the experience was a waste, or a disappointment, but it wasn't what I was hoping for.  Still, really cool.  I loved it. I plan to try it again in about 2 weeks with a stronger dose.  I'll do a follow up on it.  Maybe I'll even do a comparison.

596	Endogenous (86), LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
597	Well, this experience wasn't the first time I'd experimented with psychedelic drugs by any means. In fact, the weekend before this particular Saturday, I had eaten a tab on Friday and a tab on Sunday. I had gotten the acid that weekend from someone I ran into completely through random dumb luck, and on the spur of the moment I bought 10 hits. I have very different standards of self-control than most people and that actually made Tom, my sidekick and friend, very nervous about my mental/physical health. He was opposed to doing the LSD and told me that on Friday.
598	When I woke up on Saturday I was expecting a fairly boring day. Tom had slept on my floor and at 11:30am when I finally woke up and kicked him awake, we set out for coffee. Over coffee and cigarettes we decided that we wouldn't do the acid, we'd save it for later when we'd appreciate it more. He had tripped with me last Friday (not Sunday tho, that was all by myself) and thought it better to wait. Besides, we had plans to go see a few bands in downtown Boston that day at 9pm and we could easily kill 8 hours with grass. 
599	When we got back to my house, however, we found we had a situation on our hands. I still live at home at the age of 19 (taking computer programming classes - my brain isn't rotted quite yet) and I'm pretty absent-minded, and this time I had forgotten my keys. Worse yet, no one was home and we were locked out. So of course, we ended up eating a tab of acid and heading out into the huge park across the street from my house.
600	We wandered around the park for a while with nothing exciting to report. We smoked a joint and waited and walked. We left the park and headed for the huge graveyard which is also pretty much right next to my house. At this point, the acid was having subtle effects on me. The grass of the graveyard was greener, the sky was bluer, the sun was brighter. This is something that usually happens to me under psychedelics at first and I was used to it. I was also not too taken aback when we passed three or four signs that said 'WATER' very strangely, or so it seemed. The letters were white, on a green background. The font that was used for the sign seemed to have millions of imperfections that I was only then able to pick up because of the drug. The sign seemed to stand out to me, as if WATER was something I should remember and think about. 
601	As if reading my mind, Tom suggested we go buy something to drink from the store. 'Why not?' I thought. At this point the LSD wasn't doing very much and I figured that this was a good time to test myself in public. I asked Tom if he was tripping yet, because it had been over an hour now. He wasn't really. Right about then, Tom suggested we eat another tab. I had to agree with him. We decided tripping was worth doing, so it must be done right. We went back to my house (my parents had gotten home), ate the tab, and headed off to the store.
602	We decided to smoke another bowl to set us off. We headed towards the baseball diamond, past it, and into a part of the park where people tend not to go, through a hole in a fence, and we were on a high cliff overlooking an authentic train yard. We smoked a bowl and walked along the cliff, and nothing was happening. We left the fence and I got my first real hit from the acid. We were standing on a hill next to the fence overlooking the baseball field and suddenly the green grass and the brown dirt of the baseball field all seemed to be bleeding into each other. The baseball diamond had grass seeping onto it and the sand from the baseball diamond was mingling with the outer reaches of the grass. The metal backstop was gleaming and glittering and hard to focus on. 
603	I looked at Tom. That was a horrible idea. One of the oddest things about my trip was that during the entire time, whenever I looked at my companion, I would see his face in about 10 different perspectives all flashing and changing very rapidly. I had to strain to figure out what kind of looks he was giving me. It was very odd. I'm used to looking at people and seeing strange things when under the effects of drugs, but this time it was just a bit too real. I couldn't see people for what they were during the trip. Children passing me by or playing in the playground all resembled aliens from some Spielberg movie. Most of the adults I dealt with that day looked normal, but they had an aura of evil around them that only I seemed able to grasp.
604	Had I done too much? How could I really be sure? Four tabs in under two weeks? Was that an excess? Now, it doesn't seem like such a strange thing, but at the time, the thought was running through my head like a marathon runner. It was everywhere in my mind. When I tried to think of something else, it worked its way back into my head, like a virus. 
605	The visual hallucinations had started early and I felt robbed of the laughing hysteria phase that usually overtook me. In place of that, I found myself on a rambling kick. I'd start talking and keep talking and then I'd look over at Tom and he'd be staring at me. I explained to him that my inner conversings had come out to play. He seemed to accept this answer and I was glad about that. One less thing to worry about, but Tom was worried. He was rightly worried, because less than 10 minutes later we passed a mother and a kid on a bicycle and suddenly I starting jabbering about being a kid and all my childhood memories from this very same park. After we got out of earshot, Tom made fun of me for a while about scaring the lady and the kid. I hope I didn't scare them too much. 
606	About this time, the trip was coming on full power. I felt a rush all around me. The world outside of my line of perception seemed to me to be very much irrelevant, and the only thing that mattered was right there in that park. Beforehand I was worried that I would start obsessing over my personal girl problems. I soon learned that those thoughts melted away, and I couldn't have been happier.
607	Time was also very distorted. Neither of us had a watch nor any way to keep track of what time it was. We had to go back to my house at some point to prepare ourselves to get on the train (we decided not to drive; multiple felons maybe, but responsible people). At what must have been 4:00, we had a huge discussion over what time it was. We were sure that it was nearly 7 and we had to go back soon to get ready for the show. We smoked a bowl and headed back to my house. Well, it turned out that it was 4:30 when we got back (meaning we smoked up at 4:20 - very cool, very cool; we can never make 4:20 unless it's accidental for some reason). After we realized it was early still, we headed back, but the entire rest of the day, time kept doing odd things to us. 
608	We decided to go back to the store, because we had smoked all of our cigarettes (we went on chain-smoking mode once the trip started) and we wanted to buy some candy to eat as an experiment. I found, however, that being in the store was more then I was prepared to deal with, so I told Tom I'd be waiting outside, gave him money to buy me cigarettes, then went outside and smoked the only cigarette I had left from before. Once I was alone and outside, the world changed gears. It went from being extremely small and centered around me to being very large. I suddenly became aware of every single person who walked by me and what they were doing. Then they all seemed to be looking at me. I decided it was all in my head - all paranoid delusions. I tried to find Tom in the store window, and I succeeded. I watched him pay for the gummi worms (our testing material) and cigarettes, and noticed how he avoided looking at and talking to the clerk. I found it very amusing apparently, because I started laughing hysterically. At that point my brain reminded me I was all alone outside and I said, very loudly, 'Oh shit...', turned around, and saw some guy legitimately staring at me.
609	Bad vibes overcame me, but they were soon gone. Tom got out of the store and tossed me a bag of gummi worms and a pack of cigarettes. Bliss. Usually when tripping I find eating is generally out of the question. When I think I'm hungry, I get a ton of food but then I can't eat it, or something goes horribly wrong in the process of getting food. No matter. Gummi worms aren't exactly food, more like fun, weird, strange globs of chemicals not entirely unlike the ones I had in me causing all these effects in my brain. The gummi worms were great. I puzzled over their movement, their taste and texture, and had a very long conversation about it. 
610	The store is across the street from the park on the other end of the park from my house, so we went back into the park and sat at the end in an area that was circular with benches around it. In the middle of the circle was a tree with a fence around it. We each sat on our own bench and stared at the tree in the fence. Suddenly, in my brain Tom was gone. He was out of sight and out of mind. I checked my limbs for a status report but I couldn't really control them that well, so I gave up. I started to hear my heart pounding loudly and then the tree started to seemingly dance. It was skinny, small, and without leaves. It was twirling and rippling and the fence surrounding it was bobbing up and down. The rush I spoke of earlier intensified. Suddenly, there were church bells. The church bells played a strange, enchanting sound. I can't be too sure how long I sat there watching the tree and fence, listening to the church bells in my own little world. Suddenly, though, I realized Tom was sitting on the next bench over. I had actually completely forgotten about him, but I didn't want to break up what was happening. In my mind I explained it as a pure trip, that is, what was happening to me right then at that exact moment was everything that acid should have been. Of course, this was probably just the drugs speaking, but it sure felt that way. The combination of sight, sound, and taste sensations had overwhelmed me with goodness and I was lost. I wondered to myself if Tom was experiencing the same things, but he looked bored when I finally looked over at him. I made a really quick attempt at explaining it to him, but it didn't work at all.
611	Anyway, eventually 8pm did come and we had to leave for the show (after smoking some more pot). At this point I was still tripping, not as hard as earlier, but the acid was taking its toll. All the people on the train seemed to be detached from me and Tom, and they also seemed to be staring at us. More paranoid delusions. I had a quote of HST's running through my head all during the train ride, trying to keep myself grounded:  'ignore this terrible drug.' Unfortunately, it wasn't that easy. Everyone I looked at had big, buggly eyes and was leering at me. I had decided that they all knew there was something wrong with me. I could pass it off as being drunk tho, and that's not that bad for 8pm on a Saturday evening. 
612	We got to our desired T stop at 8:30 and that left us half an hour to kill. We wandered around with no particular direction, half strung out and half still tripping. Now, Boston is not a town for psychedelic drugs by any means, but I've survived peaking in Boston so there wasn't much in the town that could throw me off, or so I thought, but instead, out of the blue, two people offered to sell Tom and me two different drugs (one was e, and the other was called 'charley,' which I think is heroin but I can't be too sure). That got me extremely paranoid and anxious about going to this club, because i have spent a lot of my life in Boston and I find it incredibly hard to find anything around here. Odd. 
613	But, by the time doors opened and we got in, the acid was pretty much completely gone and the dope had worn off long ago. I had a slight headache from dehydration but I danced my ass off anyway. All in all, a fun day and a great trip, maybe the most intense I'll ever have. I got home and passed out first thing. Woke up and went to work for some overtime to pay my way through next weekend.

615	I am an old head. I have not taken large volumes of LSD, as it's potency seems to revolve around your potency. It is the only drug that is impossible to abuse. Respected, it can be dreadfully strong. It operates on your system primarily as a sensory amplifier, when potent, to the point of distortion. 
616	As a professional musician, I can say that it's Inspirational,but to be respected. When used as a tool to gain advantage over booze and other situations, it is at best extra legs. Over-use leads to depression. The power to trip is in you: LSD is only the catalyst. While you are young, you can dig it the most, it uses up the vitamins and enzymes in your system, which are replaced by time and nutrition. Have respect. Do you see God?.....Of course!!!!!! By opening your eyes wide and gaining empathy with His creation! Do you become God???// No way.  
617	You must repent. It is not wrong to experience LSD, it is a privledge, and a joy. How can you get tied up in an experience that is only temporary.? By taking what you've learned to the test. That's Life. Love, Stephen

619	I have used LSD 27 times so far this year, I only started this year.
620	Here were I live LSD is very expensive and sometimes you don't even get your trips, the dealers steal all our cash, So sometimes I would get a half but not less! Well It seems that every time I trip out something stays with me I don't have hectic flashbacks but strange visions eg: I have a permanet trail shadow following my hands when I move them around and at night all the shadows in my room moves like ghosts! 
621	Its not really freaky but I think thats what LSD is suppose to do 'FREAK YOU OUT' anyways when I drink coffee the effect is worse and the longer I go without tripping the worse it gets. So when I take a Trip the effects are gone for about a week , but the hands still makes trails! This all started happening after about 6 trips! They were manily SUN FLOWERS, HOFFMAN'S & MARILYN MONROE's!

624	        Wow, first acid trip in 8 months. This dude I know from on the
625	Internet sent me two hits of Red Sun acid, and I took them both. It hit me
626	fast, in about a half hour, and it hit me hard. I played guitar and talked
627	        It was an interesting trip. It hit me a little around midnight of
628	the 20th. I took a hit of pot right at midnight to celebrate the first
629	minute of the first day of spring, and that kicked in the acid. Around
630	1:45 things were real intense so I decided to get off the computer and go
631	lay down in bed. The near-full moon was very bright and shining in my
632	window, with clouds swirling unnaturally fast around it. The bars of my
633	window frame were flickering around, and the still bare tree branches
634	outside were dancing wit their own life. It was very visual, and too
635	intense to look at for long, so I pulled down the shade and closed my
636	eyes, and went to that inner, chaotic, cut and paste universe of vivid
637	imagery that I hadn't been to in years. Cartoony voices seemed to be
638	saying nonsense words from every direction as I floated there in
639	hyperspace, saying things like 'Zlerty-zot meep awwww znew' or 'Sbpack
640	Sbpack.' After a while, the chaos organized somewhat, becoming a jumbled
641	collection of imagery and themes that seemed to come from Jewish culture.
642	Flash to images of a baby in a crip, this feels something like a memory.
643	This gives way to images of people I know now, only I see them as they
644	would have been as small children. Eventually things spiral down to more
645	coherent imagery, and I lay in bed thinking about life until around 4:30

647	 I was 17 at the time and I remember getting back from school and calling up one of my boys and asking what was up for the night.  It was a friday. He told me that he could hook up some acid, so I said let's try it. So me and my twin brother went to his canton 20 minutes later and he already hooked up 10 tabs for 25 bones, so we gave him our share and we all took 3 tabs each. He saved 1 for the next day.
648	I drank a big cup of orange juice to help kick in the effects (I don't know if that really works) and waited. Twenty-five minutes went by and I didn't feel a thing. I thought we got ripped off and my homie says, 'He said this shit was potent.' And I said, 'Man, we took 3 doses and I ain't feeling shit.' Five minutes went by and I realized how wrong I was. This shit had me on a 14 hour trip. In the peak I saw everything in a glittery glow and everything I looked at began to melt. My bro and T said they felt it too. They said they saw tracers and my brother said that he felt like he was melting. It was insane.
649	Anyway, I was listening to my walkman and I go outside of my homie's pad. It was already getting dark, but then I started to notice that everything began to move with the rhythm of the music (I was listening to some Jimi Hendrix). It was so intense how the timing was just exact, it would slow down then pick up pace. The sounds I heard in the music resembled life, it was like reality was represented by the music and I could feel myself floating. I let my eyes go out of focus and then I saw hundreds of little pictures of me right in front of my eyes, like I was staring at myself from behind while I was looking into a mirror. I looked to the sky and I saw the stars forming geometric shapes. I have never had an LSD trip like this before, this was something else.
650	I saw a cat calling for me and I looked into its eyes and realized that I began to communicate with it. I really understood what it wanted. I think it was a stray cat and it seemed to be lonely. I could see what it was thinking, and it undersood how I felt. Let me tell you, I'm not a cat person, but I started to pet it and it felt grateful for my company. All of a sudden it sounded like it was whispering words to me. Though I couldn't understand what it was saying, I felt it was speaking truths. My bro and T were just sittin' there on the couch just tripping, laughing at everything, man. But I saw this and it seemed as though I knew why it was like this and I couldn't explain it. I could still hear the cat then I said, 'Farewell, little guy and good luck.' I went back into the room and tried to tell these guys what was happening, but they were laughing too much, so I couldn't blame them.
651	I sat on the couch and listened to my walkman. I felt like I was in the music. I couldn't see myself anymore, I could just hear the music all around me. Then I closed my eyes and opened them to what seemed to be a universe and all this time I could hear music playing in the backround. I lost track of time and it seemed like an eternity, but when I closed my eyes and opened them again, I was in my neighborhood walking and it was daytime. This all on the kraziest 14 hour acid trip of my life. I tell you, this really was something else. Almost like a dream in reality.

653	When i turned nineteen (summer of 98) i was a heavy acid user.  i had just found out that i had impregnated  my ex-girlfriend and was somewhat of an alcoholic loser.  However, we were getting really good lsd mailed from out west, and i was eating a fair bit of it.  over the course of the year i ate it about every weekend, usually 3-8 hits.  i would constantly feel someone hovering over my shoulder and whispering something in my ear.  i couldn't tell who it was but knew it was a girl. this happened approximately 5-7 times over the course of the year.  
654	the following summer me and my friend got drunk and decided to injest 30-40 drops each.  it was scary but interesting.  the same thing happened but this time i realized that it was my ex-girlfriend because i could see, feel, hear and smell her. i had gone to visit our child that day for only the second time in 3-4 months. within two weeks i cut my hair, got a job, and started working on getting my girlfriend back.  
655	two long months later we were back together, but the coolest part was about three months after that.  When we had just finished making love on a
656	january night she whispered the same thing i had heard those many lsd-induced times before.  we have been together ever since.

658	LSD (2) : General (1), Mystical Experiences (9), Unknown Context (20)
659	It was a friday night and after my friend and I had gotten back home, we decided to trip.  Well, actually we had decided to two days ago, but that was just the point-of-no-return per se.  Anyway, I had 3 hits in my posession.  1 white blotter with a star on it, and two sweet tarts that had had liquid lsd dripped onto them.  Around 12 I took the white blotter and my friend took one sweet tart.  We waited, and waited, and waited for what seemed like forever.  
660	My friend mentioned that he was hungry and so we decided to get some midnight snacks.  We went into my kitchen and made some popcorn and sandwiches.  For some odd reason i started staring at the popcorn and when i realized that i had been staring at the popcorn for some time, i realized that my friend was not in the kitchen anymore.  So, out of fear that my parents or younger sibling would discover him tripping balls, I started whispering out his name, and after what seemed like an eternity of searching i found him standing in front of a mirror in my entry-hall and all he said was look at the mirror.  Now this is probably my only regret of the night, however, I have grown from this mistake and I am sure that it is only specific to me, but I decided to look in the mirror.  It was AMAZING, my face suddenly became nothing and then was immediately an 'aliens' head (those grey ones that are commonly depicted on TV).  This scared the crap out of me.  So my friend and I decided it would be best to go back into my room.  
661	I felt extrememly uneasy and anxious almost paranoid.  I decided to get on IRC and talk to some 'experts' I knew.  As indicated by a so-called 'expert' i started watching Tom and Jerry.  My friend started laughing his balls off, while I could only think of how bad it must be to be the little mouse helpless to such a predator as a large cat.  However, again this i believe is only specific to me and furthermore sprouted from an incident that occurred only a month before.  Anyway i felt that what i needed to do was just lay down and relax and listen to some music.  So I got in my bed and realized that it would all be over soon and that i should just enjoy it while i could. So I just relaxed and listened to some Bob Marley and closed my eyes and looked at all the patterns and amazing visuals that I was seeing.  There were so many that I cannot remember them all, however, there are two that stuck out in my mind.  One occurred after my friend had insisted on turning out the lights and turning off the TV.  I was staring at my wall and noticed how it looked almost like liquid, so I decided to touch it and when I did, it rippled and some of the 'liquid' came off on my hand and quickly started engulfing my entire hand, I loved this, it was right out of the matrix.  Another wonderful visual that I experienced was when I suddenly felt this urge to stare at my fingers.  My index and middle finger suddenly turned into cartoon baby blue-jay's. 
662	Contradictions and Additional Notes:  I forgot to mention that around 12:45 after feeling no significant effect, i took the third sweet-tart.  And also, my 'friend' who I was with insisted on turning out the lights and TV, which pissed me off, but because of the fear of inducing a 'bad trip' i didn't argue.

664	I was 18 the first time I experienced what would forever change my life.  My friend had done acid before, and I was intrigued with how a small piece of paper could cause some of the things she described.  She led me on my first trip...
665	We were walking from a neighbor's apartment to our apartment, which was only a few yards when the effects started to occur.  It seemed like it took days to walk the short distance.  The hairs on my arms began to stand up...the air felt light...I felt like I was gliding along...noticing things I had never noticed before.  Lights had multiple colors, not just the white color I had only seen before.  The wind made the most incredible, exciting sounds through the trees.  Words are insufficient to describe the experience.  I felt I was in touch with the universe...like I was one with my friend...we could read each other's thoughts.  Life made absolute sense.
666	I have described it to people by saying that the 'walls in my mind were torn down.'  I have never since seen life the same as before the first experience.  There is more reality now, be it good or bad, REALITY.  It is this continued perception that makes me believe one never comes down after doing acid.

669	The second time I tripped, it was with my friend, and boyfriend at the time; we'll call him J. It was way more intense than the first time, but I felt worse after I came down. We got the acid from another friend and took it at her house at about 8pm. J and I were with a third friend, W, who wasn't on anything that night. We were driving out to J's house and we picked up some fast food on the way and ate in an empty parking lot near J's house. While they were eating I started feeling the acid. I felt tingly all over, and then it felt like when your foot falls asleep, but all over my body. J and W walked around the parking lot smoking a cigarette and I stayed in the car because I was cold. I was looking at the car seat and it looked like it was breathing, very gently. 
670	Then we went to J's house, and talked to his parents and grandmother for a while. I was really feeling it by then. I felt detached and kind of unfocused or tranced out. We went outside and we were leaning against the above-ground pool. Water looks really awesome when you're tripping. I was leaning against J and we were entranced by the stars. The clouds appeared to be coming in closer and closer. J was trying to explain it to W and we waved his lit cigarette across the sky. J and I both saw it leave a bright trail and we were like, 'Whoa!!!' W just said, 'Okaaaay...' (He's been with me both times I tripped; he finds it hilarious to watch people on acid.) We went inside and were watching Outbreak  on one of the fifty billion movie channels. The sick people looked really disgusting. 
671	Then we went outside; it was December so it was pretty cold. J and I smoked a joint and we were just having fun being fucked-up dorks. W was having fun watching us be fucked-up dorks. Me and J spent a lot of time looking at the sky; we both saw a cloud that looked like a man's face moving around. At one point I was holding the joint and the wind blew smoke into my eyes. Everything look beautiful and swirly for a second. It was just a screen of white opalescent smoke. J, who doesn't exactly live in the best part of town (he calls it the ghetto but it's not too bad) was telling us about all the neighbors that went past. Then we saw a dog across the street. J went over and started barking at it. It barked back once, J barked back louder and ran toward it, and the dog hauled ass down the street. It was really funny. We went back inside, and by then I felt like I was just drifting through everything we did. 
672	All of a sudden, all my thoughts, everything just made perfect sense. Everything seemed so right, and I was thinking that this was how it should always be. J was holding his baby niece for what seemed like a long time, but my sense of time was way distorted, anyway he and the baby just looked so content and peaceful. That added to my thoughts of how right everything was. W and I had to leave soon after that (we're still in high school, we had a lame curfew). On the way home, my sense of time got even more out of whack. The clock would say, like, 11:30 or something, for what felt like ten minutes. Then I'd look back what I thought was 2 minutes later and it'd be 20 minutes later. Before the tripping started, J and I told W to let us listen to 'It's On' by Korn when we started tripping. So me and W listened to it on the way home. It was awesome. If you've never heard it, it had kind of weird, fluctuating noises at the beginning. 
673	I was at my dad's house for the weekend, and of course I didn't want him to know I was tripping, so I was trying to avoid him as much as possible. I wanted to go to bed because I hadn't peaked yet and I was afraid I'd act too weird in front of him. There was a towel on a rack in the bathroom that look like it was contacting in and out like an accordion. My dad asked where all we'd gone, and for a second I completely blanked out until I remembered we were at J's. I told him i was tired  so I as going to bed, but he was in a talkative mood. I was beginning to have visual hallucinations so I finally locked myself in my room for the night. The walls were moving. My dork little sister had hung pine tree garland things all over in honor of Christmas, and I swore they were breathing. There were also foil garlands that looked like liquid that was dancing. It was cool. 
674	Then I noticed the ceiling. It's wood so you could see the grain and where the paint is peeling, and the patterns it formed were moving all over, like a flat lava lamp. I watched the ceiling most of the night. At one point the design changed to bugs and scorpions but I didn't freak like I thought I would have. The bed was the softest I've ever been in. I was floating. My deep thoughts returned; over anf over in my head was a mantra of 'Everything is now.' I was thinking that we spend way too much time obsessing over the past and future, and we should just chill and ejoy everything now. I finally got to sleep for an hour at 7am. It was a better trip than my first, because I didn't see things that much the first time. But next time, I'll probably do it during the day. 
675	This was the day before semester exams and I need sleep! Since then I've kind of kept in mind the 'revelations' I had; I quit worrying so much about what I could have changed of the past and I don't freak about the future, I just kind of go with the flow. Which isn't a bad idea, I found. See, drugs are good for some things!

677	So there's this thing that came through my town called the Omegafest and my friend buys several bottles of the pure liquid that allegedly starts the national chain of illicit lysergic acid.
678	This stuff is so strong and pure that I fill a by-then almost empty food-coloring bottle with tap water and swish and gulp... Blugh! I've never really tasted acid to such an immeasurable degree, and I soon discover that despite my self-proclaimed guru status I have never dosed like this before.
679	So we're (my friend and I) winding back to our origin of consciousness and we're discussing trip stuff. After awhile I realize that my consciousness is completely delocalized and quantum reality is surging through my brain. I have to think really, really hard to figure out what room I am in and by midnight I have forgotten everything that I had done earlier that day.
680	This is where it gets weird... I come to discover that me and my friend are of the same genetically evolved species, except I'm the active component and he's the passive component. He had mastered the trip from the past up the the present and I knew the trip from the present into the future. Anyways we finally succeed in smoking pot and I am suddenly absorbed in what I swore was post-terrestrial existence.
681	Everything I saw moved in ray-traced slow motion and all light appeared to be pixellized. This is where the missing moment begins. We are walking in perfect circles in his apartment living room speaking back and forth to each other without thinking about it at all, utilizing the vehicle of our heightened consciousness to communicate. Then, I bump into a chair and it fucks with my orbit. I obliviously pick the chair up and heave it as if it was the oppressive force I've experienced my entire subjective existence... right through a gigantic sliding glass door.
682	My friend looks at me astonished, but I assuage his anxiety by proclaiming 'Hey man! It doesn't matter anymore! We're creating everything we perceive with our minds and now you and I are going to infuse our thoughts and make the universe contract into the big stop! Finally! We're god now!'
683	How incredibly naive. We proceeded to break a lot of other things in his home, spit on the walls, pour beer everywhere, unleash gigantic bags of tea into the air, and cover all of the walls with psychotic gibberish in crayon. Actually, I only broke the glass door with the chair and my friend did all of the other stuff while I lay in the bottom of his shower... water blasting, curled up naked in a fetal position sucking my thumb. A baby once again...
684	My subjective cognitive reference point had completely vanished and I was thrown back into infinity... Simultaneously existing in a 3d shell with my mind expanded into the entirety of the fouth dimension. Mentally dead but physically alive. I was still waiting for us to somehow shed our old skins and enter 'thought-world' but I started coming down instead.
685	I realized that I was not, in fact, existing in a place made by my thoughts so that I could unify all things into one, but that I had just tripped harder than I've ever tripped on LSD and that now I would have to pay for the shit I broke. Kinda bummed me out that I had tripped once again only to put more polish on the paradigm and not to cross myself over into a greater form, whatever that might have been.

687	LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
688	This was one fo my first experiences with the drug and by far one of my fondest, if only for the variation in moods and thoughts and how I was able to cope.
689	The incident happened in 1993 at a MegaDog gig in London.  Similar to a rave but more trancy tribal music and with better visuals.
690	We (my friend and his girlfriend) had purchased our tickets the day prior to the gig and had spent the rest of the time what gear to take and use.  George (as he shall be called) had already gone to Amsterdam and obtained a thousand 'groucho marx' (rectangular tabs) and was hiding them from his mum in his computer.
691	A few hours before entrance we had gone to a couple of pubs and had some alchohol (I've never seen too much of a hazard of mixing small amounts of drink with other drugs) and managed to have ourselves a bit of a smoke.  I had to smoke via a pipe coz I can't stand tobacco so I'm Mr Neat.  George prefers Skunk so Skunk it was.  
692	By the time we arrived at the que for the gig we were feeling mellow but happily nervous with anticipation.  We didn't even take much heed to the intensity of the cold of the night (November).
693	After the obligatory hands-up-search-for-anything type affair at the door and then sorting coats and tickets out we all went off to check out the venue.  We'd been there before but its always the thing to do.  The music was already thumping from various rooms and there was the feeling of adrenalin in the air.  The main arena was warming up with the likes of Astralasia with deep base sounds that reverberated around the walls and straight through you.  That was good in itself.
694	Soon afterwards we met up again and decided that we would take just half of a trip for now.  Because half was the size of a normal one I knew at some point I was going to come up pretty hard.  One by one we filed off to the loos and dropped our gear.  
695	I ALWAYS have a nauseous feeling when I swallow the tab.  I think its due to the anticipated nausea that some of us get when coming up.  So after swallowing I did the innevitable body shiver with a screwed up face and went to the bar to get some water.
696	The next forty five minutes or so we spent leaning against the wall nodding our heads to the music and occasionally taking swigs of water.  We all do it!  I think I was the last to come up and when that happens you automatically think you've got a dud.  But low and behold I remember the first twinge of slight sickness.  It made me shift my position and then I felt the warm sensation in my stomach.  this made me breath in deep and I felt my cheeks redden.  Loverly!  The smile stretched across my face and I just let it take control.
697	It came in waves and eventually remained a constant.  My weight was lifted and I felt light as a feather.  Goose bumps flittered up and down my arms as I felt the steady thump of the base pulsating through my body.  Ten minutes later and I couldn't resist the urge to dance and I was off!  Eventually I was at the front of the crowd near the speakers and the stage where the djs were and loving it.
698	Every now and then I would come off for a breather.  Sometimes I found George and his girlfriend sitting down with huge grins on their faces.  We would exchange slow nods and smiles (all that's needed) and do our own thing.  I remember that when I danced my arms and hands seemed to move in a slow motion with my eyes and head following their movement.  It seemed much slower than the music was going but I seemed to be hitting the beat every time.
699	A couple of hours later and I was absolutely caned - I was sweating buckets and could hardly speak.  I would walk through the crowds as if drifing or floating and the people would just melt out of the way.  There were no sudden movements from me - well of course not, I could predict the entire movements of everyone in the building and new exactly when to turn or glide this way and that.  I was dancing a routine through the crowd that had been pre-written for me - it was fantastic.
700	The first hallucination I had was when I entered one of the chill out bars.  The very first thing I saw was the stone slabs that they used for the floor.  Then I saw the some grungy people with green army coats in the corner and then a spilt drink to my right.  It was dark here and quite crowded.  In that split second my brain had already made up its mind on where it thought it was.  Quickly the bar melted and revealed the dungeon that I was really in.  I moved slowly through looking at the dripping water and the rats that scurried out of my way.  Prisoners of some other era lay dormant in their green macs in the corners.  The stone walls had green alghi and other damp patches everywhere.  I had to shake my head before the bar materiallised.  'For gods sake' I reminded myself, 'its a fucking bar'.  As I ordered another bottle of water the images kept repeating.  I didn't panic though - it was interesting and I remember thinking how it could happen that anyone could possibly get from a bar to a dungeon cell.
701	Later I bumped into another friend who was smoking some skunk as he always did.  He seemed able to talk fine and was asking me various polite questions.  Unfortunately,  with every word he spoke I was thinking of a thousand answers and when I eventually opened my mouth to speak, a million words tried to form but ended up in alot of giberish and a few audible 'erms' and 'ums'.  This worried me a little as I was becoming increasingly aware that he could tell I was off my rocker.  I had to control the panic welming inside.  Was he looking at me strangely?  Was he giving subtle hand signals to others to suggest I was stupid? Was the group over there giggling at what I was doing, or wearing - or NOT wearing?  I looked down to check if I my trousers had disappeared.  Again, I had to shake my head.  No-one was taking the piss out of me so calm down!
702	I met with George who asked if I wanted to up to the balcony to calm down.  I nodded and followed like a zombie.  I passed a couple of people collecting for children in need who collered me for money - I think I gave them a fiver - they knew I was totalled and slapped a sticker on my chest.  I remember they made it cover the face of mona lisa I had printed with fractals and a spliff.  They thought it was funny.  I just wanted to get away from their voices that were changing pitch from high to low and back again.
703	Upstairs everyone was lying or sitting down.  I had to pick my way through all the bodies and sit down.  We sat for a while and I was able to cool down a bit.  Someone tapped me twice on the shoulder.  I looked round but noone was even near me.  I freaked!  I wasn't bolloxed enough that I couldn't mistake that tap.  And I sure as hell knew that no-one was near me.  'What's up?'  George asked.  'blddysbbbllblbl...um'  I replied in good effort and then pointed to my sticker on my chest.  It had gone!  Oh my god, had the mysterious tapper pinched it or had I imagined those people downstairs?  I hadn't imagined the fiver that was for sure.  Panic was on its way back again. 
704	I got up and decided to go back for a dance - yeh dancing would get my head back to noddy land.  within a few minutes I was leaping around madly fallowing the green and red fractal designs that my hands were making whilst courting with the flashing lights.
705	Now, George had warned me previously about some type of Ether that companies were putting into their smoke machine during these times.  He'd said it was like Amyl Nitrite in that it brought everyone up in seconds without them knowing and then they'd have a really ace time and tell all their friends about the gig - thus more gigs.  He also said that it had a habit of multiplying the effects of any substances that you were on by about four times.  Looking back I think it was some urban rumours that were going around - but I still think about it.  Anyway, I remember at one point (when Eat Static were playing) at a crux of a tune the smoke machine let out loads and ingulfed everyone.  In the next few seconds I watched as if not part of my body, as EVERYONE became one moving body.  Their eyes all widened and searching forwards.  it was like a huge wave of bodies all under one control.  Then, all of a sudden I felt my left upper leg lock in intense cramp.  I dropped like a sack of spuds and then really panicked.  No-one had even noticed I was writhing in agony!  If anything, they all seemed to just dance on me.  I picked a direction and crawled through the feet of the possessed crowd until I came to a door.  Stumbling through I was in a corridor and managed to slump myself down on a chair.  
706	Whilst massaging my leg I remember that my leg was starting to fade in green and red fractals and the floor was alive with sparks of these patterns.  All I could think was 'oh for gods sake not now'  I didn't panic then and was more pissed of that I couldn't benefit the picture because of the cramp.  A girl materialised with a glass of water-'...just as you asked-'  I smiled and wondered when I had asked her.
707	The pain subsided and I calmed down and I sat back and watched the patterns for a while.  Green and red sparkes were shooting across the floor and all over my hands.  The walls were pulsating and shifting colours and the music was altering its pitch chaotically.  Sitting there I could at last appreciate it for what it was and desperately wanted to work out how it happens.  At that point George came through the door with his girlfriend and they didn't look to pleased.  They asked it I'd noticed the change on the dance floor and George kept on saying about the Ether.  We all agreed to go outside into a square that was part of the building's grounds.  Here we were able to cool down.  I didn't bother speaking but just listend to the whispers of other conversations all around me.  The sound was like the noise of the sea genlty rolling on a shingle beach.
708	Soon we decided to leave.  I had to be led as I could no longer steer myself in the mathematical fashion I had done before.  I remember walking onto the street and seeing the cars.  The tracers that the cars left behind made it seem as if they were moving at high speed.  Watching them it seemed like they were moving at one mile and hour.  The noise was jingle jangle of squeaks and mumbles.  Getting a cab was the funniest part as neither of us was in any decent enough position to speak properly and we had to enter an office to order it.  It seemed like it took twenty minutes to get the words out and then we were in the car-I was sitting in the front.  
709	In London the all night cabs are driven by dodgy people with their own cars.  It suddenly dawned on me that we could be taken advantage of here.  None of us would be able to put up a struggle.  I didn't even know where the hell I was let alone put my fists up.  My door was opened and a man started shouting.  This was it, I thought.  We're gonna get mugged and I'm supposed to be the tougher one.  I started laughing.  As it turned out the guy thought our driver was taking his fare.  A few seconds later and we were off.  We stopped under a bridge briefly so that I could be sick out of the car.  George was putting it down to the effects of the Ether - again.
710	When we got back I got the cramps again and George's girlfriend got me some salt/sugared water which worked a treat (strongly suggest it for dehydration) and I lay there quietly tripping and slowly coming down.
711	With no sleep, I was up and had left by six thirty in the morning.  I had to travel the underground to Victoria and then down to Brighton (about sixty miles) to work.  Needless to say I was completey plastered and still a little bit tripping.  My boss was not amused.
712	That's it.  It was, looking back on it a great time and well worth it.  For since then I have been able to work out my own personal dosage and have developed a good understanding of hallucinations and what to expect.  If ever I take trips now its usually about a quater of a tab at a time.
713	One good thing about trips is the ability for hand-eye co-ordination.  I have learnt some of my best tricks whilst tripping.

715	A few weeks ago after a local concert a friend of mine named Chris and I had nothing to do, and it was about 1:30am. I offered him to trip with me and we both dropped a ten strip of pink elephant blotter. We are both experienced acid heads who've done that much before, so we weren't expecting anything out of the ordinary which is why we didn't get a sitter.
716	At about 2 while I was buying Chris some cigaretts the acid began to work. As I walked into the CVS, the shop lifting detectors started to go off. This got me really paranoid and I thought that someone was going to arrest me so I ran out of the store and threw anything in my pockets that would've set off the alarm, and went back in. This time it was ok and nothing was beeping so I bought the cigarettes, and when I gave her the money her face became colored with what reminded me of indian war paint. I got to thinking that, I was in store for a really intense trip, that I wasn't prepared for.
717	We got to Chris's house and sat in my friend Shaun's van, I asked Chris how he was doing and he said he wasn't doing that well and he thought it was a little too intense too. After talking to Chris for awhile I looked out the window of the van, and saw a pit of alligators and other lizards where grass normally is. I thought this was amazing and couldn't believe how real they looked, and all of a sudden a man riding a horse was charging down the street. Holy shit I thought, he's coming for me. Then he was gone I look all around and the alligators are still there. This isn't good my visuals usually go away after blinking or looking at something else, but this was different they wouldn't leave, are they real or fake I couldn't decided. My mind would not tell me. 
718	I tell Chris whats going on he isn't doing well either but by far better than I'm doing. He tells me to go with him to see Shaun. I don't want to leave the gators were still there, he convinces me to go with him somehow. Inside Shaun's house the concrete floor is nothing but crocodile heads, and then blue and orange snakes apear and I can feel them crawling beneath my feet. Finally, Shaun shows up my whole body is shaking and I've chewed a straw into almost nothing. Shaun trys to calm me down but he can't help. So we leave.
719	Next thing I can remember we're in a soccer field sitting on some bleachers the aligators are still there, but I've found out they don't want me, right now all of the alligators are fighting and fucking each other and are ignoring me for now. As we walk into the field there is a force field constructed by diamond shapes and as I walk through I can feel it. The stars in the sky have turned red and are shooting out white light. I look across the street and see dinosaurs, I ignore them. Holy shit there are 2 cars pulling into the field, are they cops? My friend assures me they are not and I hear a robotic voice yell 'get over here' Chris tells me he didn't hear anything. I begin to power walk back to Shaun's. 
720	That is all I can remember from that night, but I know I spent a lot more time shaking and being frightened. I think I had such a bad trip because of two things, one no sitter, and two I couldn't decifer what was real or fake. The whole next day I didn't sleep at all and spent most of the day silent.

722	LSD (2) : Various (28), Bad Trips (6), General (1)
723	I went away from my job in Pittsburgh for the weekend of July 4th.  I met up with some travelers at the Pittsburgh Intern'tl Airport and we drove up to Ridgeway Pa in a rental car.  I was there for the weekend, and while camping down in the Bear Creek valley I heard that somebody was throwing a rave up in the main 'Owl's Nest' parking lot.  I chose not to go.  The night of July 4th I was walking with a good friend i hadn't seen in a long time.  He had been a soldier for the US army until he got kicked out for smoking pot.  
724	Anyway, he convinced me to go up to the rave that night in the parking lot.  He and I walked up to the A-camp that was nearby to get a ride to the main parking lot about 2 miles away.  I bought 2 hits for blotter from an older hipped out brother and gave one to my friend.  We were speculating about the authenticity of the stuff i'd just bought when some dude and his passenger asked us if we wanted a ride. We hopped right in and drove off for the parking lot where the rave was.  
725	We were crusing along with some strangers who were probably already tripped out, and here there was some other guy walking along the road.  The driver stopped and asked the guy if he wanted a ride.  So this other dude with a bookbag gets in the back seat with us.  He was rather 'studious' looking.  He was wearing glasses and had a button down shirt with a collar.  After we had went along a bit he asked the driver if he wanted any 'dose'.  The driver and his passenger declined.  My friend Hayden and i looked at each other and i then asked if we could have some.
726	This dude pulls out a chemistry lab storage bottle with a dropper at the top of it.  This bottle was brown glass and probably about 1000mL.  He says 'This is the washout from the basins that they use to make LSD.  Some elders gave it to me and told me to pass it on.'  
727	My friend and i thinking it was diluted each took about 2 droppers full of the liquid.  I distinctly remember swishing the liquid around in my mouth. 
728	So hayden and i were dropped off at the parking lot, and i began to feel the effects of the L starting to kick in.  We found out that we had quite a way to go to get to the party.    Hayden walked off and i sat down beside someone's dark green Vw bus.  I enjoyed laying there and i felt it's personality communing with me.  
729	I got up and went to walk down the road to the rave.  The effests were coming on strong now.  A group was a little bit ahead of me and someone had some glowsticks on a string spinning them around.  I kept thinking that they had lightsabers.  I caught up to the group, and i could hear a girl breathing across the road from me.  I moved closer to her. I felt that i needed to protect her.  I was her bodyguard.  I had no idea who she was.  I asked her name and she told me it was Amy.  
730	We walked further down the road.  Where was Hayden?  The moon was full, the silver light casting everything in a spacey glow. What a wonderful time i was going to have!!
731	I was a little scared form time to time, but the fear faded quickly.  The thing i was most concerned about was becoming confused and disoriented.
732	The group i was walking with finally got to the rave.  There at the entrance to the litle space off the road was Hayden.  I hugged him and he laughed.  He kept poking me to see if i was really there.  He said something to me about being naked, so i walked over behind the setup.  There was a u-haul and a gasoline generator with a tent canopy set up for the DJ booth.  I walked behind there and took off my clothes.  That's when the thoughts invaded.
733	Hayden had been in the Army.  He had been in communications. He had somehow taken contol of a government communications satelite. Here he was playing techno music on the world communication network!!!  He was the DJ!!!  I was running around naked yelling at the people over at the DJ booth to leave him alone.  
734	Then i thought that I was in the making of the next Star Wars... Episode II.  Frank Oz the voice of Yoda had died, and i was the only one who could talk like Yoda. I was running around talking like Yoda.  I thought my friends Laurie and Melissa were there.  I remember talking to a girl who i thought was Laurie.  That's when the corporations too over.
735	Since hayden had stolen the satelite, the top companies of the world wanted to restore peace.  An asian girl sat near me and mentioned somethign about Ford.  She was the daughter of the top Ford exec!!!  For some reason she got mad and went to walk away.  I tried to get her to stay there.  So i followed her to the entrance.  And there was Hayden!
736	He talked to me for a little bit and i asked him to help me find my clothes.  after a while he looked down at me and exclaimed 'You don't have any clothes!!!'  'I know!!! Help me find them, they're lost!!!!'
737	I did find my shoes, and i walked back out to the dirt roadway.  I was looking at the moon, and i kept seeing a laser beam shoot across my vision ala Dark Side of the Moon.  So i walked off in the direstion i thought leaded back to the main parking lot.  I was walking over near the edge of the road, and i entered the woods.  I was feeling kinda funny.  I stumbled into the brush, and i remember crashing over and falling down.  I was dying.
738	My mind drifted off into a Tolkien book.  I could see the words written in that elegant text.  I was part of the earth and my body melted (rotted?) away and for a thousand years i was a hillside.  Then water and wind pushed away the dirt and i was flat again.  It was like i was reliving that part of the earth's memory.  
739	I became concious lying on my back staring up at the stars through the canopy of leaves.  I had the feeling i was lying in a net.  Some people were talking to me.  This was a test.  I was being trained for the special underground organization that Hayden belonged to.  I was held in a net and i felt my mind drift away.  I became a two dimensional object.  I was a 'downward spiral'.  I was spinning and spinning and drifting downwards.  Images came to my mind of two seperate entities.  A goat an a dove were pulling in opposite directions.  I had a message sent into my brain.  
740	'There is no greater wrong than a child torn between the parents of two different religions'
741	I spiraled off some more and i became the film of oil on a stagnant stream, and i looked up to see a dragonfly land above me.  It's compound eye glittered in the sunlight.  I then became one of the facets of the eye.  The words of Albert Einstein entered my mind.  'I just want to know the thoughts of God. Everything else is just details.'  I saw Einstein as he arrived in heaven. He asked God what the answer to life was, and God said 'YES'.  As i became coherent i thought that God had let me travel back through time and space.  I had been allowed to go back to 1978.  I was allowed to travel to San fransisco, California in that year.
742	I got up and broke free from my 'net'.  As I walked out of the woods i thought i could surf.  I ran down the road as fast as i could, and i stopped a guy standing beside the road.  'What year is it?'  He looked at me kinda funny and answered '1999, dude'
743	So i tried to find my clotes again, but no dice.  At least i had my shoes.  Now, if i could only find which way i was supposed to go.  I walked for a bit and ran into a 'DEP' officer.  I walked over to him and asked him how to get to get to the parking lot. He issued me a ticket.  I didn't have any pockets, so i slipped it in the window of a parked car along the road.  I kept walking, and if i saw a car approach, i would hide in the woods.  I stopped by another car along the road, and i asked a guy that was camping there  for a pair of pants i could wear.  He hooked me up with some pajamas pants.
744	I finally made it to the parking lot after an eternity of walking.  I had lost Hayden, but i knew i'd see him again. I went over to the rental car i had come up in, and layed on the back window.  I looked up at the stars, and i saw the milky way smeared across the darkness. I fell asleep glad to be out of the whole mess.  Someone nearby was playing some Grateful Dead on a car stereo, and i fell asleep to Jerry's guitar.  
745	I woke up a little later and i was freezing.  I got up and walked around.  Two cars over someone had left their window down.  I looked inside and decided that they wouldn't mind if i slept for a little bit inside.  I opened the door and crashed out again on their back seat.  
746	When i woke up in the morning, i rolled up the window of the car and walked down to the valley to meet my traveling companions.

748	LSD (2) : Festival / Lg. Crowd (24), General (1)
749	I feel a little guilty about submitting this since I haven't been able to read the entire experience archives and have no way of knowing if this is a rather common experience or not.
750	I love acid, but I usually have a problem finding time to have a whole trip Micro dots are like litte aspirin pills of acid and they can, we realized be crushed up and snorted.  This way the trip hits a lot faster and lasts a lot less time.  something to try if you ever get a hold of some dots.
