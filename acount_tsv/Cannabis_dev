1	1	a	I dont know if there exists a good game recipe to play while on marijuana. We also tried Dreamfall and we were fascinated every inch of the way through the city. Agon: The Mysterious Codex creates a solid setting too but can get frustrating. Myst seems like a good choice - I havent tried yet but I imagine that it can get frustrating. Condemned 2 might ring a whistle. Fact is that you can believe in scary things more readily, live them more thoroughly.
2	1	a	All in all, I consider cannabis to be a great substance for living stories (medium to large doses, 100-200mg+ high quality/pers.).

5	1	a	This was not my first experience with pot, but it certainly was the best that I have ever had. 
6	1	a	It was 5/21/08 and my friend S and I had the intention to hang out at her cousin H's house and possibly smoke weed and we had discussed this at school and planned it all out. As soon as it was time to go at 3:00 PM, I met her outside the classroom and we walked off to her car and left for a place to get a bite to eat and then to my place to get some shit if I had any left. We got to my house and I found that there was only a tiny roach left, so I took that, a pair of tweezers, and a lighter. Now, this was some good shit I had thought, so I didn't want to waste any. We got in the car after saying bye to my parents, and we left to go to her cousin H's house. Little did I know what was in store for me.
7	1	a	4:30 PM: The car pulls in at cousin H's place. I've got my weed in my pocket, along with my tweezers and lighter. Now, S had told me that H was big into weed so I didn't feel as if I should keep this from anybody or not, so I brought up the topic of pot so we all started discussing it and such. A couple minutes later, H's cell phone rings and it is supposedly her dealer that has called so S and I both looked at each other excitedly as cousin H said 'You ready for me to spend a hundred dollars? Yeah, I'll be there soon.' Cousin H got us in the car and we set out to the dealers house. 
8	1	a	5:00 PM: We arrive at said dealer's household with a large rust-red volkswagon bus with hippie stickers all over it, and flowers popping about here and there in the garden. S and I wait in the car while H goes in to get the weed. About 10 minutes later, H comes back and the smell of mint/skunk immediately fills my nostrils as I move up to see what she's got. Holy shit, this stuff smells so fucking good. Cousin H unwraps the magazine page and reveals the most beautiful marijuana that I had ever been blessed in my entire life to see. Absolutely fucking beautiful weed;  some real top notch stuff. S and I smile at H as she wraps it back up and we set off back home.
9	1	a	5:30 PM: S, H, and I get back to Cousin H's place and we go to the side yard where the table and chairs are. H talks to S about being a designated driver, what if she gets too high, what her parents will say, ect.. while I get out my little roach and tweezers and light it up. I take about 1 puff off it and it's already much too small for me to smoke anymore so I just put it in my pocket for me to unwrap and roll in another joint later. Well, S puts some eye drops in so I figure I should do the same and we're both smiling really big at each other as we do this. Cousin H goes back in the house to roll a joint, and as she comes out I was greeted with the most amazing looking hooter I had ever seen in my life! H lights it and takes a few puffs and then hands it to me, seeing as my parents know I smoke weed and are fine with it. I take 2 pretty good hits off it and wait a minute, and them a couple more and give it back to H and thank her graciously for being able to smoke that wonderful smelling, looking, tasting, joint. 
10	1	a	5:35 PM: I cannot feel a thing, and I wonder what is up with the weed. I know it's great stuff, so I lay back and figure that it's just a creeper. 
11	1	a	5:40 PM: I REALLY feel it now! S didn't want to get high, but shit I think I'm high for the both of us at this point. Cousin H looks pretty fried too, but she can act perfectly straight if need be. I need to learn that talent.. 
12	1	a	5:45 PM: I break into the chip bag, and Cousin H and I tore that bitch up, haha. 
13	1	a	5:49 PM: Yes, I'm looking at my watch and writing the times and everything that's gone on. I feel really messed up, and I start to explain how I feel to Cousin H. She looks at S and says 'oh dear god what have we done!' with a huge laugh at the end. I get on the trampoline and jump as high as I possibly can and I jump way above the netting. I feel as if I close my eyes, I'd be teleported away into outer space I'd be up so high. No, I'd be so high that God himself would put his hand to his forehead and gaze up into the sky and watch me fly up, up and away! Nobody and nothing could bring me down now, absolutely nothing. My skull is unscrewed like a bottle cap and my soul is wisping out and away with the wind from the center of my head. I feel completely dissasociated from my body and I touch things to see if they are real. All of my emotions, feelings, memories, hopes, and dreams are being poured out of my skull, and I feel as if everyone else can sense them as well. I feel very united, I feel perfect. I jump higher and higher, not even God with a telescope could possibly see me. I jump higher, and I hit my head on the ceiling of space and flutter back down, laughing. I feel a full body orgasm and every cell in my body is screaming with the most amazing pleasure it's ever felt. It's good to be human and I love life and everything in it. Well, everything but sadness, but that doesn't exist now. No, not now it doesn't.
14	1	a	6:00 PM: There are a lot of people here and I am tired so I sit back at the table where everyone is congrigated. S suggests that we leave because I'm acting really weird, so we do. I wanted to be with the people and possibly tell them how good I feel so that they can feel the same pleasure, but I didn't have the chance to. Oh well.
15	1	a	6:10 PM: We arrive at Taco Bell. I order a bean burrito and she doesn't order a damn thing because she isn't high. I tell you what, that bean burrito tasted like heaven.
16	1	a	6:15 PM: We go to the gas station to get gas, and I run in and get 3 packs of gummy candies to eat. I think the lady at the cash register could tell I was fried off my ass, but I didn't care. We get back in the car and I tear open the packages and get to eating.
17	1	a	6:30 PM: The car is driving at an incredible speed as we go up this mountain, I can fly! I throw octopus gummies on the window of the car and laugh my ass off with S. 
18	1	a	6:35 PM: We get to the top of the mountain and I take pictures of it. I want to jump off this mountain and fly so damn badly. I have the most amazing wings, and they say 'PEACE, HOPE, and LOVE.' and I can do anything I set my mind to;  I want to fly. 
19	1	a	6:40 PM: Apparently that didn't work to well, because S had to shove me back in the car because I really wanted to jump off. Oh well. We set off to drive around town and just chill. I can feel the peak of the high barely wearing off, but it is still ten times or more powerful than any shit I've ever had.
20	1	a	7:00 PM: I arrive home, I don't know how, but I'm here. My parents are sitting on the couch and I'm trying as hard as I can to look sober because I've got to get a job interview done soon. I can't worry about that now, so I go up to my bedroom and just listen to music. I find that everything sounds a lot better than they usually do, and stuff is a whole lot cooler to watch. I could do this every day all day..
21	1	a	7:30 PM: I'm completely knocked out cold at the point, because I laid down and the cozyness of it all drifted me off to sleep. I dreamt of candy, flowing everywhere, spinning in circles, dancing across my field of vision;  melting, twirling, dancing, like a tribe of Native Americans doing the Corn Dance. 
22	1	a	It really was the best experience on pot that I have ever had. Since then my stuff hasn't felt as good since, haha. Have fun out there!

24	1	a	I assume it is a somewhat infrequent occurrence to have such a severe, psychedelic-esque trip report to be reported just from Cannabis use, but this is what happened. 
25	1	a	Background of the Story: This was less than a week after I got a somewhat bad concussion, though the symptoms of it were strange and it was hard to pinpoint the status of my head. My tolerance to weed has always been very low, but because of my recent concussion, this experience was something unrivalled in intensity, and the effects it induced are not at all representative of what one thinks of when they think of a Marijuana experience. 
26	1	a	Story: I decided I would invite my friend over, just to get some company to feel more occupied and less bored. When he arrived, we started smoking some weed out of a bong. The strain was Maui Wowie, a strong sativa, and the batch I had smoked was of fine quality. I was loaded a fat bowl out of the bong, and smoked it in two big rips. 
27	1	a	Some incredible effects immediately began to become present. I remember after I smoked it, I was trying to play a video game I enjoyed on the computer, but I noticed I was becoming too sensually agitated and went to sit down in the bathroom. I remember covering my hand, and was starting to shake. The weed had hit me too hard, it was starting to become a very unpleasant experience. I placed my hands on my face, I remember being incredibly high, telling my friend that I had to go to bed, and then went upstairs and lay down. 
28	1	a	This is when the trip really escalated. I was sitting in bed, my mind was becoming delusionally paranoid, I was fearing my parents might walk in and see me in this state. I felt my heart rate was probably something in between 150-200 bpm, and I was worried. My body was completely shaking, I could feel the bed vibrating because of it. The probably only positive (ish) thing that happened on the trip were the hallucinations. With my eyes closed, the hallucinations were vivid and memorable. At one point, I remember seeing a green circle surrounded by darkness which had a thick diameter of some sort of ancient looking design within its diameter. The circle had distinct symbolic figures lying on points all around it, and was fulling rotating. Then, as the hallucination became more and more vivid, its reality slowly overpowering my perception, I had to open my eyes. When I did this, the darkness of my eyes closed which surrounded the circle was replaced with the darkness of the room, though I could see the rest of my room in this darkness. The hallucination continued vividly as ever. 
29	1	a	After this, I can say that I had open-eye hallucinations induced from only weed (there was no way it was laced, as my friends smoked it and had normal experiences). Overall, when compared to my two experiences with Mushrooms, this cannabis experience was more intense in hallucination, bodily sensation, and most ways. The divine clarity of mushrooms was not at all present, however. Although it is hard to compare substances, this weed experience (although not enjoyable) made me higher than I was on shrooms and is one I look back at in amazement.

31	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Small Group (2-9) (17), General (1)
32	1	a	Last week I woke up and immediately ate a fairly potent cannabis brownie thinking that it wouldn't hit by the time I got to the airport. Boy was I wrong. One hour later and I'm stoned off my ass attempting to make conversation with my mom on the way to the airport. She had to have known. I had planned on taking a second edible when I got to the airport but decided against it as the first one was already working its magic.
33	1	a	As soon as I got in the security line I felt a surge of paranoia. With the recent terrorist attack in Brussels I couldn't help but feel anxious at a major city airport. I could tell that the people around me were nervous as well. Nobody was looking each other in the eye and there was an air of uneasiness. I noticed the keen attention the TSA was giving to people of color. One elderly lady in a hijab was asked to pass through the metal detector three times before she was allowed to proceed. I felt guilty for being afraid. For giving in to the reaction of hate fueled ideologies.
34	1	a	As soon as I got through security I was able to relax a bit more. I got to my gate and watched passengers hurriedly walk among the airport corridors. Each person with their own complex lives crossing my path for a single fleeting moment in the form of a fellow traveler. I was the same to them.
35	1	a	The edible had taken full effect by the time the plane had taken off. As the plane got higher and higher, the tiny houses below got tinier and tinier. The arrangement of streets below began to resemble tree roots, branching off from one another as far as the eye could see. As we ascended above the clouds, they too began to take geometric form and seemed to have an almost Aztec-like architectural filter. 
36	1	a	Then something peculiar happened. Something that I have not experienced even in my endeavors with the classic hallucinogens. I was watching the clouds and I could see colorful light patterns begin to define themselves against the white background. As these patterns became more evident they came together to form a bird. While the features of this bird were not clearly defined, its overall shape was. For the next 5 to 10 minutes I was flying next to this light bird that seemed to be playfully flapping in the wind. I rubbed my eyes, opened and closed them, pinched myself, did everything I could to convince myself my mind was playing tricks and still the bird persisted in my visual processes. For the first time in my life, I was having a 'hallucination' that appeared to be more than just mere sensory distortion. The bird eventually stopped in the middle of my visual view and spread its wings as if to reveal all of its glory, turned around and flew away into the distance.
37	1	a	I don't know what to make of this experience. On one hand, my mind is playing visual tricks when presented with the blank white space that is the clouds. However, on the other hand, this seems to fall right into the category of a true mystical experience. One thing is certain, I got more than I expected out of the edible.

39	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Glowing Experiences (4), General (1), Large Group (10+) (19)
40	1	a	It was the night of the school reunion. Me and an old classmate shared about half a bottle of vodka. That of course made us a bit drunk, even if we are experienced drinkers (we are from Denmark).
41	1	a	But as the reunion drew to a close, we wanted to continue the party in the big city. And so we did, but not before a quick trip to 'Christiania' (the 'freetown' in Copenhagen, much like a mini-Amsterdam, I guess). There we bought two nice hashish cookies. Nothing new about that, we have been eating cookies many times. But these were not the cookies we were used to.
42	1	a	We eat em, and went into a club in Copenhagen. The club was packed with people, and a handful from the reunion too. Well, the club is not the kind of club we normally go to. This was pop, and we prefer techno.
43	1	a	Then things started to get crazy (remembering that this is 'only' hashish). Suddenly I realized that I was totally wasted! I heard all the voices clearly now. It was pretty funny, I could hear conversations across the lounge-room, just being able to ignore the rest of the noise. And looking at peoples' faces, time sort of slowed down, and I had the feeling that I had known that person for a long time, knew what he/she was like, knew where they grew up, etc. They were all unique characters in a movie. A funny thing.
44	1	a	Then I got more and more tunnel vision, and more and more disorientated about where I was, and what to do. People from my old school (that had been at the reunion too) came over and talked to me. But I didn't understand a word of what they were saying. Not that I couldn't clearly hear them, it just didn't make sense. When I tried to speak, jibberish came out of my mouth too. I was so confused, what had I just said?!
45	1	a	Well, communicating with anyone but my best friend became impossible, I had just realised. So why not move to the dancefloor? The music was pretty nice. (It wasnt. It was terrible pop music, but at the time it was really nice).
46	1	a	Then something strange happened. Something I have never tried with cannabis before. I got sort of a hallucination! As I was standing on the dancefloor (unable to really move my body to the music by the way), the volume of the sound seemed like it got turned down, and I could only hear the bass sound, like a heartbeat. And the colors from the dancefloor light became very sharp, almost blinding me. Then my point of view got elevated to the celling, and as it did, I saw that all the people looked like flat cardboard people. Like sprites, in two dimensions, in a three dimensional room.
47	1	a	Then I got sort of scared, that was not supposed to happen! I said to my friend I wanted to leave now, course this was not what I wanted. And then we left the club.
48	1	a	I'm sure people thought I was on acid or something, I was talking jibberish about the cardboard people at the dancefloor.
49	1	a	We got outside, and went to get something to eat at the fast food place. Ordering was very hard, and confusing too. And eating the burgers was a slow process. I don't remember much of this myself, but I was told it took me around 15 minutes to eat a burger.
50	1	a	Then we took a taxi home. And I remember the street we drove down was almost infinitely long. Also pretty strange. My friend got dropped off at his house, and then there was a 5-10 minute drive to my place. Then I started getting a little worried that the driver was going to cheat me, or drive me to some remote location and drop me off. But he didnt an I somehow got home!
51	1	a	Fell asleep and woke up confused and disorientated a few time the next few hours.
52	1	a	To sum it up. I was very surprised by how fast and powerful the cookies worked on me. And very surprise to almost see a halo! But it was a very fun 'trip'... I must have had a stupid smile on my face all the time.
53	1	a	My best friend didnt get wasted that quickly. He got wasted when he came home, two hours after. Still very powerful, but not as heavy as I.
54	1	a	I think they might have been a little nice in mixing the cookies that day :)

56	1	a	Cannabis - Hash (93) : Club / Bar (25), General (1)
57	1	a	This is a report of my first time smoking alone on a school night. I haven't experimented with many drugs before, just weed and pharms, having had a very good time doing them on all occasions.
58	1	a	8:00-I sneak downstairs to avoid the watchful eye of my parents and begin to pack a bowl with some good quality weed that has brought me some very good times in the past. After I've finished I watch some T.V. and wait until my parents go to sleep.
59	1	a	11:00-My parents have finally gone to sleep and I hurry downstairs to grab my homemade bong. I sneak out the back door, onto my porch, and into my backyard, but it is extremely windy outside, so I decide to return onto my screened-in porch.
60	1	a	11:05-I finish smoking and return to my house. I notice that the wind outside seems more harsh and it freaks me out a little. Inside, I notice haloish affects around lights and my hearing is dulled.
61	1	a	11:45-After watching some flash videos, very hilarious, I decide to go and take a shower to remove the smell and so that I wont have to do it in the morning.
62	1	a	11:55-The warm shower water makes my skin feel incredibly tingly and I feel very relaxed. While standing there, I have an epitome. I realize that this shower water is composed of thousands of little droplets, just like people in a society, and that these droplets are separated and become individuals when they are shot out of the shower head, just like being born. I also realize that their existence is short, just as ours is, and that they all rejoin each other at the drain, just as we all end up in the same position: dead.
63	1	a	12:10-I finish my shower and go to bed. I quickly fall asleep and dream of myself traveling through the world as a droplet of water.
64	1	a	I wake up the next morning, still remembering my experience. I feel as if I must try harder to make my existence worthwhile because I know that my time on this earth is short and if I don't do anything about it, I'll end up in that drain having wasted my time.

128	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Poetry (43), General (1), Unknown Context (20)
129	1	a	Went down the road for a couple of drinks (flatmates friends birthday), night started off normal, listening to music etc. Awhile later there were some deserts passed around, truffles and brownies but these contained cannabis.  Just had 1 of each, why not, no commitments at the time Having a good time going up and down stairs (others up there) while coming down the stairs spotted (for the first time) the occupants large ornament of Buddha in some stone colored blue, interestingly placed as you walk down, wow I thought that was cool.  Felt quite high from the sweets, as only had 2 drinks, and started to feel it more and more with racing heart and jelly legs! Thought it was time to head home, just down the road Opened the door, something didnt feel quite right, went to my room, 1 cat was on bed that woke up, meowing and kept meowing wouldnt stop, thought there was something seriously wrong with him, this accelerated the high more, then felt like someone or something was in the house, so checked round, of coarse nothing physical, but something wasnt right and both cats acting strange (mind you-they missing 1 owner who was away).  To the lounge, sat down to try relax because it was intense and heart race, while trying to relax/meditate/breathing  felt powerful forces, spiritual energy pulsing through my body, especially focused on hands, knees, spine, head. Like electricity race up the spine to the head and out the top (no real closed eye visuals except pulsing light).   
130	1	a	While this was happening 1 thing that crossed my mind was a crystal relation? and also that Buddha a saw earlier This part sitting down wasnt scary (like the cats) but intense, felt like it was more than something that just the plant set off.  Wow.  As far as the cats go, when arriving home earlier I thought they where trying to tell me of a spirit in the house, but reflecting on it a day or 2 later, I have a feeling spirit inside cat? and not able to look at the cats eyes since without unease dont like cats as much now (feel like they are stealing good energy).  
131	1	a	Didnt get much sleep that morning but when I woke up I felt like I had some sort of awakening! Only sort of similar to 1 or 2 other times in my life - (A SIMILAR HIGH/GOING UP THE SPINE -AFTER JUST SMOKING 1 BUCKET),, (IN SOME WAYS MORE INTENSE THAN SOME OF MY MESC/CACTUS TRIP BUT WITHOUT THE VISUALS).  Had to write it down.

133	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Various (28), Entities / Beings (37), General (1)
134	1	a	The following story is completely true, not a bit stretching the truth.
135	1	a	Last night I went to a club in SOMA San Francisco. I watched a few sets from the band, and after finishing my Hefeweizen I to outside to bum a cigarette. A woman with curly black hair offers me a joint. I smoke one fair toke, cough a bit, but not too much. After that I was pretty much gone. 
136	1	a	The bouncers from the club tell us, You cant have that on the premises, then one of them says, Cant you read the sign, says no-meth zone.' Or something like that. We stumble down the street. I could not comprehend what she had meant. I ask the woman I am with, Nivette, and she says, I think she is being sarcastic. I still dont understand. Its just pot I say. Nivette responds, yeah my family accepts this as a normal thing. I was too naïve to ask if there was anything else in the joint. Or actually, I was just stupid to accept a joint from a strange woman. From what I read afterwards about experiences on meth, I think the joint was laced with PCP or something.
137	1	a	I started to talk to Nivette about this guy Ezra I had been dating for about a month. He had just broken up with me that day because he is Jewish and I am not. It was something that bothered me and I did not understand it. I hoped that by telling people I could get some insight. Nivette says she is attracted to Jewish men, she says she is Babylonian which she says goes way back before the Jews. Then I think it would be a good idea for Nivette to talk to Ezra. I call him, its about 11pm at this point, and Nivette immediately reprimands him, Why are you breaking up with this woman, just because she is not Jewish? She is a princess! 
138	1	a	Next thing I know Nivette and I are kissing against a chain link fence. My phone still open as Ezra listens to me kissing and breathing, Ohh this is soo nice. Nivette brings me up against a small tree or parking meter, I slide down it as she feels me up. People are walking down the sidewalk, couples hand in hand, amazed to find two women making out on the ground. Her hands moving over my smooth dress, my breasts, between my legs. Then I look up at peoples stares of amazement, and realize what is happening, Whoah, what is going on. I get up and walk down the street with the lighter, ¼ of a joint and my phone still open. 
139	1	a	I hear some good rap music coming from a taqueria across the street. I jaywalk across the 5-lane road. I start moving to the beats as I walk up to the window. I determine the man making burritos is amazingly cute and I tell him he is gorgeous, he smiles. I walk up to a guy eating at a table outside, and have a strange conversation. Then I realize I am freezing and I go up to a group of people stepping into a van. I feel the warmth from inside the car and I ask where they are going. I end up telling them to all ride bikes and I slide the van door shut.
140	1	a	I walk back across the street and this guy with a blue mowhawk steps out of a cab. I go up to him and smooth his hair up between my two hands and exclaim, That is awesome, I love it! He laughs as he walks away. I continue to go up to strangers talking gibberish. I felt like I was dreaming! Really I was like, wow, when am I going to wake up. 
141	1	a	At this point I was cold and wanted back in the club. I go up to the bouncers and they say, You are too intoxicated to enter. I say in disbelief, Wow, what is going on here? This has never happened to me, I have my ticket right here, see my stamp? I hold out my hand. We dont care. Then he takes a black marker and draws two large Xs on the tops of my hands. I try to enter anyway and two men PUSH me back out. 
142	1	a	I leave, amazed this is happening. Now I feel like I am in a nightmare. I walk up to a homeless man and buy his newspaper, then start to cry, telling people, This man is homeless! I was so cold, the wind ripping between the buildings and this homeless man just standing out there. He responds sadly, I am just trying to make enough money to get a place to stay.
143	1	a	I felt so far away from my home, like I would never get back. I go back to the club and walk in thinking I can pretend they wont notice me, but they push me out again. Some people come out of the club and I go up to a couple, drawn by the beauty of the guy. I tell him he is beautiful and reach to feel his hair, then I turn to his girlfriend and say, You are not good enough for him.(!) And she replies, Well, I am glad you feel that way. Wow!
144	1	a	I call my friend who is inside and he comes out. I say they wont let me in and they explain I am too intoxicated. I dont know what my friend is thinking at this point. Finally the show ends and my friends get a cab and we all get in. We go to their hotel, I think I even kissed my friends friend in the elevator, a woman I hardly know. I lay on their hotel bed and I wanted to make out with the two women, but they get me up and take me home in a cab. I get home and I am like, Oh my god what just happened!?
145	1	a	So let this be a lesson, dont accept drugs from strangers!

147	1	a	Cannabis (1) : General (1), What Was in That? (26), Various (28)
148	1	a	Well it was during the middle of summer vacation my friend paid 60 dollars for an eighth of this really good smelling marijuana from a guy that usually doesnt get the best stuff. But he claimed that this was really bomb ass dank. So we bought it expecting to get the same stuff that we usually get and to be high for about 1 hour. So I stayed at my friends house that night to smoke it and he had already been caught by his dad once so we had to be careful about how we did it. We started at about 11:00pm and we had an awesome glass pipe I had just bought from my friend with a nice size bowl packed into it already. My friend since he paid for it got the first hit. After it got passed to me about 10 times I was done and ready to trip out. We had smoked in all about 2 bowls and then couldn't even inhale smoke anymore so we were forced to quit.
149	1	a	After that I don't really know what happened we listened to a mix of songs I had made especially to make u trip out. There was lots of techno and weird stuff like English guys singing. Then we got to the techno song called Marijuana In Your Brain this is when all the weird shit started happening. My spine felt like it was moving up and down through my back making it tingle, my head felt like it was flying off of my body into heaven, and my feet stayed on the ground which sort of scared me because I'm afraid of heights and looking down from the clouds was pretty high up, and I could see myself going through the ground all the way to the core of the earth. It was the craziest thing I have ever felt.
150	1	a	Then we realized that we had a huka party poster that reacted to a black light that we haven't even looked at yet. So we turned on my blacklight and I looked at the poster and listened to the music again. I was laying on my friends floor staring at the poster when all of the sudden there were 4 mushrooms in the corner that started moving in a circle, and all of the sudden I was sitting in this park and all these kids were yelling and I couldn't figure out what was going on. But luckily then I realized I didnt like this and it was the song doing this to me so I jumped up and switched the song.
151	1	a	Then I laid back down on the floor looked up and closed my eyes. When I opened them it was morning but I was still feeling a little high so I got up and then decided we were going to go out for breakfast so we smoked another bowl and went for breakfast at the same place we work. That was a mistake because when we came back the high was pretty much done ,it had been about 3 hours and his dad had came home early, he ran into my friends room after us and opened my friends dresser and pulled out all of our weed, pipe, and a methadone pill we had just got. My friend was grounded for month and his dad never told my parents. My friend that I had got the pipe from was pretty mad because he had smoked about 4000 times out of it and now it was gone. I now have quit because this whole time I have been getting piss tested by my parents and if I fail another one I have to go to rehab.

153	1	a	Cannabis (1) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
154	1	a	This experience was a few years ago so i cannot remember all the details, insted of inputting every detail I will get streight to the point.
155	1	a	While on the computer on a sunny day a friend (We will call him Danny ) contacted me on MSN and told me that his parents and family had gone away for the weekend and asked me if I wanted to stay over. I was good mates with another friend of his that lived near him that I had spoked to on the internet we will call him Luke. As I'd been wanting to meet Luke face to face for a while we always plannned to get together and have a smoke-up. I was most delighted and at about 5pm I got down to his village met up with Luke and went to his dealers. We only had £10 and so this could of scored us an 8th but the guy only had 2 teenths so we baught them. We eventualy met up with Danny. He was with his cousin and his cousins mate, I didnt mind them comming as im a generous smoker and dont mind sharing my shit.
156	1	a	Eventually the smoking started in Dannys backgarden. We took it kinda easy to start with rolling big joints with about 10 minute gaps inbetween rolling again. We was all having a good time laughing, joking and telling stories. The time was about 8pm and after the 5th joint I felt a bit giddy but it felt like my laughter was fake and I slowly fell into depression. Ive experienced and know others have experienced feeling down from smoking cannabis before but this time it was more of a strong feeling. 
157	1	a	While in this state I kept quiet and kept on smoking while observing the conversation going on by the others. I was occasionally asked by them every so often if i was alright, I gave them a nod and replied that I was fine. I was layed down and the depressive state kept creeping up on me. By this time I was very intoxicated and eventually my vision was consumed with bright moving patterns. I began thinking about my life, friends, family and my future, but that was making me more depresssed as I didnt have a clue what I was going to do with myself after College. I began thinking how i was percived by  people that knew me. Then It hit like a ton of bricks, I understood how i was percived. I could see myself reconstructing was i was like around people like my friends for example, was I some sort of Geek or some annoying moron that other people look down on? could this be the reason why I dont always remain friends with people? because I cramp there style? Was this me? Millions of these thoughs rushed around my head while each one was reanacted in my mind. Everybody else at this time was chilled out with only a two way conversation going on. I asked everybody else if they was mashed (Mashed meaning very stoned/intoxicated) they and they agreed. 
158	1	a	A good few hours after I was coming down to earth and Felt much better. I was in denial about the thoughs I encounted that night for a while and eventaully I came to terms with them. All of it was true. Back then I admit I was kind of annoying, lacked communication skills, and made people feel uncool while I was around them. 
159	1	a	Now-a-days I am more sociable, have better communication skills and Have more friends. Maybe cannabis helped me see this properly and helped me see the door to improving my life and life style.

161	1	a	Cannabis (1) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Depression (15), Small Group (2-9) (17)
162	1	a	My experience occured about a year and a half ago, when I was 14 and heavily into drinking and smoking marijuana. . .I was in the middle of a football camp week, and that night I had a few friends over. We were basically bored, until one of my other friends called my up and asked if I wanted to go smoke some weed, and threw out there that he had some dust, so I happily agreed. We walked our asses about a mile to some bridge in the woods next to a lake.
163	1	a	Well anyway, he busts out this shitty ass wooden bowl and we throw all that stuff in there and smoke it. We then stand up and about 5-10 minutes later we're really feeling it, my friend sayss, 'dude, just pretend we're sitting in some big ass reclining chairs watching TV' so I did it. . .it was soooo comfy and real feeling. My other friends(who were sober) said we sat in the most uncomfertable looking positions for about 20 minutes.
164	1	a	After that we journied off the bridge into a trail in the woods, my friend starts doing to siccest impression of the Corcodile Hunter, he was like, 'look over there! it's a three-toed sloth with Goneria' and I get down on all fours and start doing all the habbits he is saying it does. . .including sexing my friends mother and walking extremely slowly(later my friends told me i was crawling through glass not even phasing me).
165	1	a	We continued down the trail until we looked out onto the lake and saw some floating lily pads. . .or so we thought. We kept focusing on these things until we got closer, and they started moving! This was all in the dark so me and my friend start bugging out thinking it was a submarine coming up from the depths. . .THEN! we instantly found ourselves in the middle of the Vietnam War for some reason, shooting 'charlies'.
166	1	a	Later down the trail we hit some LONG grass which was really bugging us because it felt like bugs on our legs, but my friend says, 'man, we cant feel this, our legs are covered in foam'. . .and that instant the irritation dispeared, it was great. A few feet more and we found ourselves in one of those old Mario games for nintendo, picturing it seemed so real, like I was really in it. . .
167	1	a	Well, the last funny thing to happen was I closed my eyes while we were walking and I could still picture the suroundings as if my eyes were open, but it was changing colors like crazy. . .until, SLAM! I walked right into the raised bridge. . .5 minutes later I noticed I had a huge gash on my arm, and continued to go off on my friend for about 5 more minutes about how they should have told me the bridge was there.
168	1	a	Man that was great. . .I haven't done it since, but I probably soon will.

170	1	a	Cannabis (1), PCP (113) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Nature / Outdoors (23), General (1)
171	1	a	Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] 
172	1	a	It's fair to say I'm a stoner.  I smoke pot just about every day, spend my money on pot, and regularly go to school/work stoned, and no one really notices.  So generally, I don't get really fucked from a bowl or two.
173	1	a	The other day, though, I bought some shit from a buddy of mine.  It was a fat eighth, so naturally, I assumed the volume was to make up for the fact it was shitty regs.  Fuck it, I rolled a couple joints, went out, smoked a joint, got a surprising high, but straightened myself out with some music and TV, and fell out early.  
174	1	a	I knew this was good shit when I smelled it, but looking back, I'd gotten far more fucked than I should have from what I smoked....  Anyway, I took some bong hits with a buddy the day after, but then the next day, I went out into the woods, at a favorite spot of mine, and lit up a joint.  At this point I was waiting for someone...  After I finished, I was immediately at a regular point of high, and I still had a bowl on me, so I said fuck it, and lit up.  A couple deep hits, and I was sitting on a log with my head hung, looking at the ground.  
175	1	a	All of a sudden, I heard a ticking in my head... it wasn't that loud that I thought there was a giant clock or something, but I was unable to completely phase it out.    So I focussed on it, and as I foccused on the ticks, and I saw a line of pink, red, and green crossing my vision, straight across.  My vision continued to light up, and things in the ground became highlighted, images in the pine needles.  I saw a lot of A's outlined, as if I was suddenly seeing what was drawn in the pine needles.  I had a sense of profound purpose about these images, but was not altogether out of control enough to shout it out to the world.  I was fully conscious that I was high, but things that happened were just uncontrollable.... There were the usual thoughts, for me, of writing a show in my head as it goes along, and watching it in my head, laughing at the funny parts but often getting into plots too complicated and completely forgetting what I was thinking about, but there were further, physical visual hallucinations.
176	1	a	When someone walked their dogs past me, I was able to focus enough to keep my visuals down to a blur and some excess colors, and put my head in my lap.  Soon after asserting control over these visions, I began to feel as if I was in purgatory, still on my log bench, but as if focusing one way or the other I could enter different worlds, one progressingly further into images of the pine needles, becoming so complex as to be completely colored clowns' faces, the other the 'real' world, just me, cold, in the woods.  
177	1	a	I soon realized an hour or so had passed, and I was starting to come down.  I could not realize half of what had happened that I told myself to remember, because it was crazy, but my friend never showed up, and apparently I made some calls to another friend of mine flipping out...  This shit must have been laced, but hell, I don't care.

180	1	a	When this experience occured I had already gone through various experiments with weed, and was used to the mind altering effects. The story begins when I was hanging out with a couple of friends, hitting the bowl. We had been passing it back and forth taking deep hits of the bud, which was extremely potent. We had been smoking for a while and I had yet to feel the high set in so I kept smoking. We finished off the herb and started to walk down the street, slowly my mind oozed into a dream like state, which was considerably pleasent. 
181	1	a	We had reached my street and as I looked around I noticed a house that seemed to look exactly like mine except completely backwards, also the houses around it were similar to those around mine. At that moment  I could only think that I was in a universe that contradicted the one that I was in while I was sober. I told my friends my thoughts and they all seemed to agree. I then had a vision, but not a halucination about the future. In the vision we were sitting in my neighbors driveway at night rolling a joint when a cop car pulled up. At the time I thought nothing of it and proceeded rambling about my parallel universe.
182	1	a	 About 10 minutes later we were in my neighbors driveway and one of my friends suggested rolling a joint,it was then I remembered my vision,  told my friends that this was my vision and we had to go somewhere else, but everyone was stoned and had lost all motivation to move. I made them move and we went so someones back yard, about 5 minutes later I saw I cop car drive down the street with a spot light going really slow. It was amazing, I still dont no if it was just deja vu or the weed?

185	1	a	I hadn't smoked weed in well over 2 years when I decided one night to take a friend up on an offer to get high and go to the school's homecoming football game.  We acquired a dugout and a one-hitter from a friend and proceeded to smoke approximately 7 hits each.
186	1	a	Initially I was dissapointed that I wasn't feeling the effects at all, and began to think that maybe what we had smoked hadn't been weed at all, and that I wasn't going to feel anything that night.  On the car ride to the school, I began to feel very relaxed, and out of body, almost.  As I looked out the window nothing seemed quite real.  I decided then that I didn't want to go to the game, and instead would prefer to sit at home and study the wonderful effects I was feeling.
187	1	a	I noticed as I walked that my limbs seemed to be working completely under their own control.  As I walked my legs felt as if they were controlling themselves, and there seemed to be a very powerful force pulling me around.  If I would lean heavily to one side, the force would pull me back, as if I literally could not fall over, the force would not allow it.  The night was wonderful.  As I typed on the keyboard, my hands seemed to float, and perfectly coherant sentences would turn into incessant ramblings, or just random letters being mashed.  Yet they all seemed to make sense.
188	1	a	Since that night I have not been able to replicate that high.  I have also not been able to get my hands on anything better than shwag.  I am wondering if the weed that I smoked that night was possibly KB, but I have no clue.  All I know is that every high I have had since that night has been a let-down, and I long for the wonderful feeling that was present that evening.  I will continute to attempt to locate some high quality weed, and attempt to replicate that nights high.  If all goes well, chances are I will become a 'pothead,' but would it really be so bad?  =)

191	1	a	One day after a night of boredom me and mate who will be known as MW rocked up to a mates place looking for some billys. He gave us about a 20 worth of good hydro. MW chopped up and we proceeded to smoke away. We went cone for cone until the mix was over. MW said he had to get back to where he was staying and walked home. 
192	1	a	I stayed on the couch in my mates room and watched AUSTAR. As I sat there I thought wow he talked up this hydro a bit, I think im gonna go and get a drink. But when I tried to move I was stuck to the couch. I shut my eyes to try and focus myself and thats when the rollercoaster experience started. I felt as if I was flying along in the rollercoaster, banking up turns, flying down hills, slowing to go up slopes and I must admit I was really enjoying myself. This continued for about half an hour until I reopened my eyes. I had a cigarette after my body could move again. My mate came in from whatever he was doing  and I told him about what had just happened. 
193	1	a	He said that the pot did the same thing to him today. So we chopped up again and smoked another session and proceeded to ride the rollercoaster  Again. This has never happened to me on any other pot and I must admit it was the first hallucination I'd had off pot and it was a great one.

196	1	a	So every weekend I  smoke a bunch of weed with my friend Jordon. I have a big house, and its easy to smoke in my room when my dad falls asleep. So one weekend, I had two other friends come up and smoke, one brought about 2-3 grams of hydro, and me and Jordon had 3 grams in Indoor KB. After smoking a good 80% of all of it, I took the biggest hit of my life. The weed cought on fire, the flame was pretty big. I got the whole bowl down in one hit, and then my whole body went numb. Then things went hazy. 
197	1	a	The next thing i knew, I was around seven feet tall, wearing a plaid brown suit, and I had a beard and hair down to my knees. I hate on big glasses, and i was being interveiwed on CNN becaus ei had discovered fossil fuel. I was interviewed for a good hour and a half, answering a bunch of questions and drawing up graphs. My friends said that during that entire time, I was speaking in complete jibberish. I either was saying random words and numbers, or just making strange noises.

200	1	a	This story is actually about a friend of mine (G) who suffered from acute depression, and had a long history of depression and suicide attempts in his family. He is extremely chemically dependant, as both his parents formerly were. 
201	1	a	What happened is that I bought a quarter, when this stupid kid called looking for a quarter and a dime, so I sold him that quarter which was skimpy at that for thirty-five dollars. I know it is a bastard move but it is some limp-bizkit kid that walks around calling people fags. I got the thirty five bucks and then called up the dude I got the quarter from, said it was a little skimpy, and asked him to sell me a half for 35. Well, he didn't give a fuck as we are friends, and then I took the half to a party at my friend J's house. 
202	1	a	There were about eight of us smoking, and since I was packing for the time being, they made me smoke a bowl out of the bong to myself. Then we proceeded to smoke most of the half, and found that it is the most potent shwag/mec that I have ever smoked. I had no problem smoking a lot of it cause it was so cheap. We were all unbelievably fucked up. 
203	1	a	My friend G, the depression guy, got higher than any of us. He also gets depressed when really high. He went home and decided to take two bottles of tylenol, 48 pills. I woke from a deep slumber to G's roomate calling and wanting to know if G took any acid or shrooms or anything, because G was puking red and delirious. I said get him to a hospital fast, and found out about the whole incident the next day.
204	1	a	He spent a couple weeks in the psych ward and on the whole fucked up his life. Anyone smart would see this as a cue to stop, but the day he was out of the hospital he took to smoking cigarettes again. The first time I saw him once he was out of the hospital, he was drinking. Two days later, he was smoking pot again. He ended up having some fucked up hallucinations due to some medication he was on. He is now back to smoking tons, and I have no doubt that he will kill himself one of these days.

206	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Depression (15), Second Hand Report (42), General (1), Not Applicable (38)
207	1	a	It somewhat started a day before the fourth of July. Raz and I had the idea to hook our computers up over at his house because his parents would be gone. Then we could play Warcraft 3 for all hours of the day. Then, the fourth of July rolled around, and I went to bed around four-thirty. The next morning I awoke around one to the sound of the vacuum. At first I became disoriented, thinking that it was Thursday, we no longer had cleaning ladies, and my mom should have been at work. I let it pass and went back to sleep.
208	1	a	Then, I finally rose from bed at roughly three p.m. and walked outside my room. Chaos abounded. My mom was cleaning the house for some unknown reason before it clicked that it was the fourth of July. She sees me...first thing I get instead of a 'good morning' or whichever greeting applies was, 'Weren't you supposed to do this?' I tell her I was going to clean the house tomorrow (Friday), and ask who ask coming over. She replied to me with, 'Charlie and Cynthia....your dad invited them...' I asked her why I hadn't been told this and she gave me this trip somewhere around the lines of, 'You knew damn well they were coming over...' and I laid things out for her. Simply, I did not know. I asked her several times before what her plans were, hoping they would leave the house. Everytime I got the answer, 'I don't know, nothing yet.' Apparently, she recalled differently. I gave her the usual rounaround: 'Whatever...I didn't know anything about it and I planned on cleaning tomorrow.' Then, very pissed  as I was, I went back to my room.
209	1	a	I got online and IMed Raz with a message that went something to the effect of, 'Let's get this bitch started.' He then told me to get my computer rounded up because he'd be there shortly. I quickly got off, unhooked it all, tossed it into my bag, and prepared to wash my face and bursh my teeth. I had not time for a shower, so I merely tossed on my hat and wore exactly what I had on the day prior. As I was getting ready I noticed all sorts of items lying around that pissed me off to all extents. Crazy fold over calendars containing biblical references and passages. Pictures that had been thrown in am obscure drawer for ages, toiletries in the bathroom that I did not know we posessed. 
210	1	a	I then had it in my mind, that I would never become this. Scurrying around, cleaning things, throwing up items that would hopefully give others a false impression of myself (be it one I hoped to obtain). This simply would never be me. I then had it set in my mind that if my dad told me to either clean up my room or possibly take the Grateful Dead sign from my door, I would begin a speech that would rival that of the Gettysburg Address. A monolouge so compelling it could be contained in a coming-of-age movie staring Colin Hanks or Josh Hartnett. I had it all planned out in my head, the entire scenario, it was so rivveting I actually began to hope he would request these things of me simply so I could give this performance. My mind was reeling: 'Dad...I'm not going to do such things. I'm not going to run around the house picking up every magazine and shoe so it appears that we live a way we do not. I'm not cleaning my room or taking the sign off my door. That's who I am. Most of your other friends know who I am...to varying degrees. I'm not going to hide myself in a lie that will hopefully please your co-worker and his wife. If they don't like that my room is dirty, tell them to close the door. 
211	1	a	Also, if I find out that you took the sign off my door, and I will be able to find out if you did...I will lose a great amount of respect for you that I doubt will ever be regained.' It was incredible. But sadly, it did not happen.
212	1	a	All I got was, 'Do you want steak or hamburger?' My reply to him was the news of the LAN with Razgard. He then told me to be careful if we got fireworks. I said we wouldn't get them...and then the doorbell rang. I opened it to find Razgard's smiling face ready to kick off and play some games. We loaded up and left for his house. We got there, set it all up, got a game ready to go, and then decided it was time to smoke some fat bowls. We grabbed the supplies and headed out to the backyard. Mind you it is no somewhere around 4:45 and 5:00 and I had not showered or eaten since the day previous. 
213	1	a	We smoked two...maybe three large bowls of hydro, and we were toast. This is the kind of high many people experience let alone with someone else. We began to walk back to his room for a rousing game of 'stoned WarCraft 3'. As we go inside I feel the cold air blast me with a nova strictly aiming for the heat arising from my body. My body is sent into a minimal form of shot. The El Nino of temperature combined with the lack of food sent a straight overkill to my brain. Instead of my stomach screaming and crying for sustance my eyes go out. It works just as that. A small pixel of black suddenly swells and amasses an army of grey and black squares that engullf my vision, very similar to a fire diffusing through an entire forest. Now, instead of seeing the home and furniture that was before me, I saw a swirling and caccophany of light greys, dark greys and blacks impairing any vision I may have once had. I was not scared though. It was somewhat entertaining and it had happened once before, so I knew the procedure. I was hot..then cold...and hungry beyond any feeling I have had before.
214	1	a	I debate myself for lingering seconds that tick away like hours. Then I decide. 'Dude...I'm fucking blind.' I comically exclaim. Raz is somewhat worried. I can sense it. They say that when people are blind their other senses become heightened. I can attest to this. I then tell him that it would quickly pass, because it was beginning to. 
215	1	a	The darkness was not as searing and it was leaving in the same form it arrived: A raging torrent collapsing upon itself. I then sat down and we began to play some WarCraft 3, stoned out our skulls. Then, as I slightly lean forward to find the nearest gold deposit, the hatred returns. My vision dies once more and I slightly turn to where Raz was at and I say, 'Dude...I need something to eat.' So, I feel my way around, looking out of what little splotches of vision that still remain and make myself to the kitchen. He points out to what they have, and I reach for the Simpson's Pop Tarts. Little did I know, I had actually grabbed a packet of popcorn. He laughs at me, as do I as I slightly read the words 'Pop-sec --' on the package. He then exclaims, 'Fuck man! Are you going to be alright?' out of pure worry after discovering the true magnatude of my condition. 
216	1	a	I relay the story of last summer with my brother when the hunger and heat teamed up to deliver a finishing blow to my sight. I also make sure to point out the comedy of the situation, because my brother's friend's father was there and told his so to, 'Stay away from that stuff,' that he, 'better not be doing that stuff.' We both laugh at this as we go to sit down in the living room. My vision is still greatly fucked for lack of a better word. We watched a little TV but I still noticed I was hungry. I was at approximately this moment that Razgard brings up, 'Hey...do you still want that Pop-Tart?' I, having totally forgetting about it in the thirty seconds since we last saw it exclaimed, 'Fuck yea! I forgot.' We both laughed at this for what lingered on to be five, maybe ten minutes. Then, we went to get the Pop-Tart. I asked him if I could have it toasted, as a warm, gooey Simpson Pop-Tart tasted much better to my mental senses than a cold, not cooked Pop-Tart. We put it in, and he heads back to the living room. I, awaiting for my proverbial 'knight in shining armor' lean against the counter staring down the heated death coils of the toaster, fearing for my snack's life. 
217	1	a	I contemplate whether or not I should save it from the metal and spring coils of death and simply eat it as it was. I then realized that it actually enjoyed being in there. The toaster was what a sauna is to us. I then smiled for him, and let a small tuft of noise pass through my lips as I nearly began to talk to it, before noticing Raz standing by the kitchen entryway, laughing at my giddyness for a Pop-Tart. Had he only known the connection we had. I was staring at him, totally oblivious to the Pop-Tart that once engrossed my every braincell, before *CHINK* the toaster exploded the toasty Pop-Tart back to it's original position, as I too exploded in a fit of fear, anger, and chaos as I did not expect the noise. My partner began to laugh at my antics, as I said, 'Fuck man...I'm going to enjoy this fucker.' I then stepped out into the garage of his home to claim a drink for myself. A Diet Lemon Coke. My meal was complete, and my blindness still intact mainly in the center of my vision. 
218	1	a	I could see the outer edges of my periphriel vision, and I used it to my full advantage. I then made the journey back to the living room to fulfill my stomach's every fantasy.
219	1	a	We turned on the TV as I ate what was the most delicios Pop-Tart in my life, complimented perfectly with diet coke, hinting slightly of Lemon. Now, being the stoners we were, we both knew very well of the odd coincedences that happen when we're stoned and watching TV. The most fucked up programming is available to us. Things that would never claim the television cables had you not been stoned. So, flipping through the channels we notice several of them, somewhat distant from each other were showing very similiar images, the kind that accompany 'breaking news' or 'top stories'. 
220	1	a	After we both noticed this and decided it was possibly something of importance, we searched frantically for one of the several stations carrying the images. After we had finally arrived on the scene of the news program, we slowly learned of the shooting at LAX airport. The caption read, 'Three dead in shooting incident.' Not sure what to make of it we watched, and then, as wrong as it may have been, laughed until we were very short on breath. The comment taking blame for these fits of laughter? 'We believe it was nearly a personal problem, nothing more than that, although we have contained all those that were in the airport.' I am still not sure why this was so humorous as it was, but I believe it was due to the conversation we had about Grand Theft Auto III days before. 
221	1	a	An incident very similiar to the one that occured in real life, happened to my friend in the game. He was running around the third island (the only island with an airport) when he found a few people walking around. He nonchalantly pulled out his shotgun, shot them both dead, and then ran for a random truck. After this had taken place I began to talk about how things of this nature would never happen in real life. One man would not randomly go somewhere, shoot two people, attract all manners of the cops, secret service, SWAT team, and any other law enforcement agency. As I was saying this, he ran into a woman who, before being shot, screamed, 'Do you have a diet soda?!' So, naturally, as everything I had mention the night before was present in this news story, I took it upon myself to yell through the house, 'Do you have a diet soda!?!' in my best woman voice. Again, we both died of laughing fits.
222	1	a	Deciding that this news story was not the best thing to watch, we set out in hopes of finding something far more entertaining. Not until I stumbled upon FOX that we saw what would become the most fucked up episode of Fresh Prince ever. We were in the middle of the episode, having missed the first half, but provided we were deeply invovled in the dialouge, we slightly caught on the what was happening. Apparently Will and Carlton mad a bet where Carlton goes into the hood for a while and tries to survive. To cut a very long, drawn out, insane episode short, Will goes to get Carlton out of the hood fearing for his safety. When he (Will) arrives there, Carlton is dressed up in all sorts of 'fly' gear, with a bandana over his shaved head, and some gold on. He then spouts out some of the usual gang/hip hop terminology, containing, but not limited to 'homey' 'Sup?' 'fronting' and many others I fail to forget now. This had set us both into a primitive state of shock, confusion, and humor all at once. Not sure to laugh or say 'What the fuck?' we simply did both.
223	1	a	Next we opted to see else became of the shooting at LAX and I continually mashed buttons on the remote, hoping to press the correct combination that would give us a news channel. I finally opted for merely typing in '4-1', '4-2', '4-3', etc... I then began to debate with myself why I did this instead of pressing the 'channel up' button. Still unsure of my actions, I continued to climb the channels in this manner. We were unable to find the correct station, although we did find some Junkyard Wars. Thankfully, we were slightly descending from out mental mindfuck of a stoning, and we were able to watch and concentrate on the show. Between laughing and watching we made many references to what a team of stoners would do had they been involved.
224	1	a	Provided you're unaware of the premise to the show, they take two teams of three, give them a certain challenge, then give them an expert in the field. Of course, the tiwst is that everything they use to build must come from the junkyard the provide. The challenges range from boats, to hovercrafts, to wind-powered cars, to tools of destruction. Luckily for us, the episode we were watching was the finals of the season, so they had to destroy a hundred foot concrete wall. 
225	1	a	Anyway, back to our jokes. Many times we told tales of how the stoner team would just weld a bong to their contraption, or simply make a scrap-heap pipe instead of what they were supposed to make. Then, Raz pointed out that on their white board for ideas and model designs, they would just have pot leaves and 4:20 scrawled all over the place. I then added that one of them would say something along the lines of, 'Dude...do you think they have anything I can eat around here?' and another one would say, 'Wait...weren't we supposed to be doing something?' Naturally, we decided it would be the best rated episode ever. Finally, the show was over, and we headed back to the room for WarCraft III. We began to play several games, each getting our asses handed to us by the insanely difficult computer opponents. We laughed and cursed and mainly blamed it on the drugs. Suddenly, things took a turn for the odd. A knock on the door could be heard, then the opening of said door. We knew very well who it was, but we weren't ready for what they had in store. We were playing and who comes through the door? 
226	1	a	It was damn BMF (Bad Mother Fucker) and a damned Ox. Naturally, both of their nicknames were changed to protect identities and/or possible misconceptions about their nature. One of the first things to come forth from BMFs mouth: 'Hey...you guys want some tabs?' Jesus Fuck! Why must they have dealt us these cards? Of course we wanted tabs damn it. We'd do tabs any time of the day. So, we had a short conversation, gathered up money, told the orders, and then waited. At this point that the two friends that just joined us were on Crystal Meth. So...we weren't too sure what to expect. I was debating whether or not to do the tabs that night, but after I found out that others would be and it wouldn't be me alone, I went for it. Just then, two other friends showed up, these two of the opposite sex. Sicily and Fuck-Up walked in for reasons I'm still not sure of. 
227	1	a	I don't think anyone knew why they came over or how they knew we were there, but nobody cared either. So, we all sat around talking before Ox claimed he wanted to take another 'bump'. We then all went to the kitchen, because to put it frankly, you don't see someone rail some Meth everyday. Everyone took their turn, sans Raz and I, he too afraid he would like it more than he should, and I...well I don't know why. Ox then told me that I could have some if I wanted, but that would be the only time he would ask. He also filled me in that no matter what he had, if I wanted some I could ask and provided he had enough, he's share. 
228	1	a	Ox is a really nice fucking guy. Raz and I went back to finish up our WarCraft III game, got our asses kicked, then went back to the living room. We all sat around talking some, then a few went outside to smoke while BMF and Sicily left to go get our rolls.

230	1	a	Raz and I yet again play some WarCraft III before deciding we should just hold it off for now and get some music ready. We begin to set out our musical collection for the roll. We also picked up the room some so we wouldn't break shit. Then we headed out to the living room to watch TV and chat with those still around. Finally, BMF and Sicily finally came back with the goods. Just like one of the three wisemen, BMF sat down, opened his little baggy, and showed us the sixteen rolls he had gotten a hold of, as well as the relatively larger amount of hydro. Splitting them up into baggys and passing them out, BMF then told us that he was going to someone elses house to hang out for a bit, as was everyone else. Minutes later, Raz and I were the only ones around again, but we still had a friend on the way. About half an hour later, maybe a full hour, Grunge showed up with his girlfriend. His prime motive for the visit was to play some WarCraft III, so I got it set up for him and watched him play. Then, quickly and quietly one o'clock stopped by, and we got a phone call. The others had dropped their pills. It was now our turn. Taking a cue from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas I turned to Raz and said, 'As your attorney I advise you to follow me into the bathroom.' It was not one-oh-five, and we were going to digest our disco biscuits.
231	1	a	We did the deed and went back to the room to watch our friend play our game, when shortly, another person showed up. Track (I just gave her the name...she runs track, no allusion to heroin, something none of us did) stopped by to hang out with us for a little while because nothing else was going on. Soon enough BMF came back while the others stayed where they were for a while. Around this time Grunge left because his girlfriend was tired and he thought her better off sleeping at home than around a collection of people she didn't know. 
232	1	a	So, now it was just Raz, Track, BMF, and myself. Again, another twist comes up. Having a few extra X's left, BMF attempts to coerce Track into rolling with us. Her only real reason for not wanting to was having to work the next day at four and being tired, but BMF still tried. I even threw in a little taste of my own, simply because I like peer pressure. I know, it's twisted. But I laid off, because I only wanted to make one little comment. Soon enough I found myself back with the computers playing some excellent toys I had downloaded. Then, I began to get restless. We had our supple of straws and water, which I carried around with me most of the time because I like water. Of course, I made the mistake of setting them down several times and losing them for extended periods of time. I would walk around the house with a stride of determination, spouting off lines like, 'Where the fuck is my goddamned water!' or Jesus Fucking Heral Christ....I just want my cursed water!' Track told me to get another glass and it would be alright, but I prefer to have what I started out with. 
233	1	a	If i just gave up on the first one I had, what would stop me from losing a second? A third? Hell, soon enough I'd have lost all the glasses. Aside from that there was this pestering tingle in the back of my mind just wondering where this amazing hiding spot was. Soon enough I found it by the TV from when BMF and I tried to get some music going in the DVD player. Having wanted to go outside for what seemed like hours, I finally said fuck it to everything, took a leak, and went outside to smoke with BMF, notebook in my hand. I had it in my mind that I would roll and draw and/or write. I had a great cigarette and talk with BMF about just how cool I thought he was, his reciprocated comment, art, clothing, people, all the usual. Then I started to talk and draw, and he told me that he wanted to go inside for a while. I told him that I'd stay out there for some time, and that he could join me again if he wished. 
234	1	a	As he walked off I asked him for another cigarette incase I wanted one, and out of generosity he gave me the rest of the pack. Granted it was only three, that's still real fucking nice. He also ensured me that if I ever wanted any more that I could ask him and have as many as I liked. I'm no a big smoker, but that's just damn nice of him. So, there I was, on a trampoline, out of my mind, with a notepad and minimal light.
235	1	a	Previous message was not received because of error (8:45:51 PM): Your message was refused by the AOL Instant Messenger server, probably because the message was too big. Try making the message shorter and send it again.
236	1	a	We did the deed and went back to the room to watch our friend play our game, when shortly, another person showed up. Track (I just gave her the name...she runs track, no allusion to heroin, something none of us did) stopped by to hang out with us for a little while because nothing else was going on. Soon enough BMF came back while the others stayed where they were for a while. Around this time Grunge left because his girlfriend was tired and he thought her better off sleeping at home than around a collection of people she didn't know. So, now it was just Raz, Track, BMF, and myself. Again, another twist comes up. Having a few extra X's left, BMF attempts to coerce Track into rolling with us. 
237	1	a	Her only real reason for not wanting to was having to work the next day at four and being tired, but BMF still tried. I even threw in a little taste of my own, simply because I like peer pressure. I know, it's twisted. But I laid off, because I only wanted to make one little comment. Soon enough I found myself back with the computers playing some excellent toys I had downloaded. Then, I began to get restless. We had our supple of straws and water, which I carried around with me most of the time because I like water. Of course, I made the mistake of setting them down several times and losing them for extended periods of time.
238	1	a	I first began to draw what I had imagened the other day. It's something I want to possibly paint out of whatever provided I get back into art (I had told BMF the entire story about how I felt out of interest with art and hoped to maybe get back into it all). Realizing that low light and trying to draw while speeding didn't work, I settled for my true enjoyment. Writing. Now, I'm not too sure how the rest of the writing went out. This was all done in the dark, on a trampoline, speeding, with possible effects of the X taking hold. I present you now with the writing: 
239	1	a	'Jesus...did I fuck up? No inhibitions left. My affidavit of responsibility chewed up and digested in pill form. What have I done to myself? Is this me? Or did I forge an alternate being in my thoughtless actions? Will I ever get the chance to figure it out? So many goddam questions....Do answers exist? If I did lay my ignorance to waste, would they be true? Is it possible that the knowledge I learn is only crafted by a cunning orator greater than myself? Impossible. There is no being greater than a mind. If truths are revealed it's simply due to my own intelligence. Fuck! My perception has been torn from its sanctuary. In its place a beast so powerful....I am unable to tame the godforsaken spawn of synthetic evil. Goddam...creatures lurk in every crevice my mind is aware of. Fucking bats and wolves --' 
240	1	a	This is as far as I got before my mind went blank. When I write I prefer it to flow and entangle rather than forcing myself to get something to work. At this time, I headed back inside.
241	1	a	Once returning inside I found Tracks sleeping on the couch (sleep is something she did often), and the others back in BMF's car with the heater on and Things Fall Apart by NIN pounding the speakers. I joined in, trying not to disturb them too much, spill my water, or drop the cigarette from behing my ear, but the latter wasn't working for me. I pulled out a lighter in hopes of finding it again, but wasn't able. Not until I got out did I find it and place it behind my ear again. I went back inside, then to the trampoline to jump. Somewhere around this time I went back to the computers to search for something to do, although I was inevitably unable to find it. I then went and laid on the floor as I always do when the others came back in. We conversed wondering if anyone was feeling anything, but nothing came about it. We tried everything in our desperate measures to kick in the roll but couldn't find anything sufficient enough. 
242	1	a	Somewhere around this time we decided to join the others at Monster's place, sadly, they too were unable to roll. Track left for her apartment, I imagine it was to sleep in her own bed, and we gathered up our things and went to Monster's. The drive there seemed like it took hours while in reality it was merely ten, maybe fifteen minutes. I nearly smoked the cigarette I had behind my ear before losing it on the floor again. NWA was rapping throughout the car as I blindly searched for the lost cigarette, again my obsesive-compulsive similarities kicked in. Finally we made it to Monster's to find Ox and Sicily in his truck blasting the heater. I on the other hand went to the house door, tapped it a few times, then walked in. 
243	1	a	I looked around at Monster and Fuck-Up, the only two inside now, and exclaimed my well rehearsed line in the car, 'So...this is where the mighty [name here] resides.' He laughed a bit, then concurred with my statement before I set in for my next line of dialouge (also well rehearsed), 'So...I know I just got here, and not wanting to come off like a dick or anything, could I use your bathroom?' Once more he ind of laughed and directed me to the second door on the left stating, 'It's a trailer, not too hard to figure out.' I then, once again, went to the bathroom, pissed off because I was still going to the bathroom. 
244	1	a	If only I was rolling, my ability to drink massive quantities of water and not urinate would have been intact. I then stepped outside and sat next to Spin (For lack of anything better to call him, merely the first part of where he works) and started talking to him. He took was on one of the pills we took, but like the rest, wasn't feeling anything. I smoked a few bowls with him and talked a bit before going back inside. After Sicily went back outside I claimed a spot on the couch next to Fuck-Up and began talking. Fuck-Up was waiting to roll the next day with some others in a big city, but after she saw how everyone else faired, she was thinking about not doing it. Monster on the other hand....he was pretty fucked up from the shrooms he ate. We sat around watching VH1-Classic while all manners of friends came and went outside. We had a small conversation about what we dubbed the 'bunk ass pills.' We had two tips and six people attempting to roll. 
245	1	a	We all started off with tryign the same one because it was rated the better roll. By this time though, pretty much everyone had one of the first, and then had just taken one of the others. Raz and I split ours up. A few of us decided to go back to Raz's place, because Monster needed some sleep and we just wanted to roll. I rode over there with Ox, smoking a cigarette on the way, while listening to the godlike Mr. Bungle. I suppose the half hit me a little as I felt good and the music was excellent. Then, just as the first, the minor feeling was gone. Ox told me he felt the exact same way. We finally went inside and were bitching about the bunk ass pills. By this time it was about 4:15, maybe 4:30, and none of us could sleep. In the house was Sicily and Spin, Ox, BMF, Raz, and Me...the six that took the rolls. 
246	1	a	Ox was real fucking bored so we decided to watch some of NIN And All That Could Have Been. I got up a few times to go back to the computers, humoring myself with google searching such as 'kicking in a roll' 'making myself roll' 'bunk ass pills' 'I took some bunk ass pills and I'm not feeling shit right now'. I found one crazy writing from someone, highlighted a passage about dancing pink elephants, and left it there for someone to see. I then went back out to the living room, where apparently everyone was talking a turn running off the shower.
247	1	a	By now, we all knew we weren't going to roll at all, and started to watch movies. It was something like 5:30 all of a sudden, the sun was up, and we were all pissed about the bunk pills. BMF ensured us that things would be taken care of and we would either get the money back for the pills or we'd get new ones to replace those. This made us all happy. We then began to watch Hackers, and about halfway through, I went to go join BMF on the trampoline to just lie there. We talked about how it was really pretty outside and smoked a few bowls to further enjoy it. I then went back inside, caught the end of the movie, and sat there while Ox selected Eyes Wide Shut for out next DVD. By now Raz was in a back room, BMF was still outside, and Spin was sleeping for work. Ox, Sicily, and myself were going to watch the movie. 
248	1	a	I had seen bits and pieces of it on TV and thought it was fucked up, but I was never ready for the shit they put in front of me. It got very fucked up, then Ox (He had seen it several times before) went to smoke a cigarette while Sicily sadly exclaimed, 'Dammit...right when it gets really fucked up I have to wake up Spin for work!' So, now I was alone, trying to comprehend the shit that was flcikering before my eyes. It ended, and I dug it, although it was so insane. Now, BMF was inside, Sicily and Spin had left, and Raz was sleeping in a room. Ox and I were the only ones left up, me by a miracle, and him by a bump of Meth not too long ago. He surprised me by putting in an unknown cassette that turned out to be old school Tom Green Show when it was still in Canada. Boy did that blow my mind. 
249	1	a	Tom Green is a fucking moron, but he's funny about it. Somewhere into the video BMF sauntered out to watch with us. It ended, and another one was put in. A second hour of madness. After all of that the time was something like eight o'clock in the damn morning.
250	1	a	When the videos finished, BMF went back out to the trampoline and Ox but in an Xbox game and played. I watched him for a little bit, then went out to the trampoline. I laid there for a while, having some very weird closed-eye visuals that I can only claim to be from the lack of sleep. I mean, the rolls would have worn off somewhere around four or five, but it was eight in the morning. So, I just layed there for a while, then got kind of hungry and went to make some more Pop-Tarts. I made my poptarts and ate them while Ox did something on the TV that I don't recall. It was either still the game or just some show, I wasn't paying attention. 
251	1	a	After I finished my poptarts and helepd BMF look for his phone some...not some...we looked for the better part of half an hour, maybe forty-five minutes. I finally found it when I went to go get my notebook out of his car, noticing his phone crammed into his boots in the back. I gave it to him, he checked his calls or whatever, and then we went back out to the trampoline. We laid there for some long length of time, and the next thing I noticed was BMF going inside. I then realized I must have fallen asleep, but for how long? A minute, an hour? Six? I went inside to talk to BMF about it and he said that he had just gotten up to go inside and told me, but figured I was alseep. I image my slumber as somewhere near ten minutes. Then I laid down on the couch to watch some more game playing by Ox and BMF. 
252	1	a	I watched about the second round before dozing off and coming to at what I imagine to be the third round or so. I look at the clock in the kitchen and it's 1:00 p.m. I then fall asleep again, this time when I wake up it's 1:30 and I notice Monster sitting there in front of me. I shout out, 'Jesus Fuck! I fall asleep and wake up with fucking Monster in front of me...that's insane.' I then fall asleep for a little longer, waking up when they're leaving to get some food at a place where they can sit in a booth and smoke. 
253	1	a	I tell them I'm going to stay there, as it's 2:30 already, and they leave. I then look at TV and see the paused game showing they played a total of twenty matches...I was asleep for a long fucking time. I almost started to doze off when Raz walked in, kind of asleep. I relayed the message about them going off, and how it was now 4:30 and we both slept a bit. He had to go meet up with Grunge later to go talk to some guy, and I needed to get home anyway. By the time we finally got around to it and got everything packed up it was 5:30. We then headed back to my house where he dropped me off with all of my stuff and headed out to see Grunge. 
254	1	a	I hauled everything inside, found a note saying my parents were gone out to eat, then I noticed my hand was all inked up. I searched my pocket and found out a pen had busted. I now had ink on everything in my pocket, including my hand. I don't know what it could mean, but I thin I'm owed some fucking Karma for this fourth of July.

257	1	a	Cannabis (1) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
258	1	a	I've been high before, but this was the most beautiful experience i've ever had. We were sitting around the circle and after getting stoned decided to put on pink floyd as usual. Then one of my friends said, 'Give this cd a chance.' The name of the cd was 'El Cielo' by a band called Dredg. We began our musical journey, the music is so haunting it's nearly impossible to describe in words.
259	1	a	I completely spaced and felt that the music only improved my high nearly two fold. Suddenly, I felt as if i was traveling, it felt like I was moving at lightspeed al thought it was apparent i was sitting still. I was immobilized. Completely paralyzed. I felt the sonic waves shining on me almost like the sun. I was no longer experiencing the music I was feeling it or even experiencing it. Now i've probably listened to the album nearly 100 times all the way through, and sometimes when I'm sober, this album even gives me a flash back high. I will never forget the first time I experienced music asopposed to just feeling it.

262	1	a	My girlfriend and I were hanging out and listening to music.  I believe it was led zep.  But recently I have been really concentrating on controlling my body and mind.  I havent ever researched meditation or anything of a sort, so thats why I'm not sure what the hell happened.  But here goes:
263	1	a	I was lying down and was pretty damn high.  I concentrated on the music in some sort of way I cant really explain.  I let the music consume me and let my imagination run wild.  It brought me to a place with laser lights and stuff.  I close my eyes and all of a sudden a feeling came over me and I felt like I dropped down.  It was like I dove down into a place.  The feeling was intense and really unexplainable.  I didnt want to leave this place so I concentrated on exploring it.  I never had a real picture in my mind, but what I felt made me think I had a picture in my mind.  I cant remember what I was seeing, but it was amazing.  I opened my eyes to see my girlfriend next to me.  She said she could see my pulse in my neck and that it was beating to the music.  I didnt try to ever do this again just because I dont know if I can.  It was that... crazy.

266	1	a	Well, I was sitting around my house thinking about what to do because my parents were gone for the week.  I decided to call up a few guys and toke a bowl or 4.  Friend A and B came over and we toked in the backyard.  It was some really good weed, but thats typical for oregon.  It was one of those 'one nug' eigths.  Once we we're extremely high, friend B started playing super mario 64.  Me and friend A decided we'd go out to the drum room in the garage to play some music.  I got on the drumset and Friend A got on the guitar, even though he didn't play!
267	1	a	Now, I'm a pretty good drummer sober, but when I'm high, the playing of drums takes on this spiritual, intense quality.  The drums sounded just perfect and the sticks felt like natural extensions of my hands.  I put on Tool's new CD 'Lateralus' through the headphones and played to it.  To my disbelief I hit everything exactly.  For some reason...my ability to percieve the timing of a song increases incredibly while high.  The beat naturally nestles itself in my mind and stays there, allowing me to improvise naturally over it.  Also, my mind strays to these complex thoughts about the 'importance' of my playing, and the general 'coolness' of hitting drums with sticks in different patterns.  Also, my creativity levels are at an all time 'high' will high (excuse pun).  My brain seems to be able to spontaneously come up with ideas more readily when stoned.  This all goes for the guitar too.  All the little riffs and techniques that are slightly beyond my sober grasp allow themselves to be played when im stoned.  Odd timings, emotional influxuations, almost sexuality permeate the guitar and amplifier.  
268	1	a	I can definately see how many of the world's most respected musicians are High 24/7, because of the incredible creative power THC seems to impart.

270	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
271	1	a	Cannabis usually makes me one of two things each time I smoke it.  I either get real excited, not nervous but my mind is clouded and has a hard time thinking.  If I dont get the above stated, I get deeply relaxed, muscle tension fades, and it feels as though a door has opened and my brain expands until there is ton of open space around my current thoughts.
272	1	a	One such experience was last Saturday.  Two friends of mine named Scott and Russ (nicknamed S and R for easier reference) bought some bud and got high before heading to the mall.  We packed a few bowls, two namely and smoked then rolled a blunt with the rest of the weed.  Between the time we smoked our bowls and rolled the blunt, I was feeling slightly giddy and giggly, yet not high.  We rolled the blunt and smoked it to where we couldn't hold it the put it in the bowl and finished it off.  I went to stand up and I couldnt.  I was feeling as if air was as heavy as water and I could only move my head really slow.  When I did finally figure out how to move my head again, it seemed as though my head stayed still but my body and the world are the ones that turned....
273	1	a	We made it into the mall, neither one of us could stop smiling.  We were walking around when I was hit with an instant of personal realization.  Im not talking about just getting messed up and heading to the mall for kicks.  I instantly realized how big the world actually was.  It felt as though time for me stopped but everyone else kept going at the exact same speed, I caught a glimpse of everyone past the mall doing their daily lives.  I stopped and took a minute to thank god for letting me see such things and experience such a nice life.  For about twenty minutes after that, it felt as though my mind and brain were two different things.  My brain seemed to take control of my body and move it for me while my brain laid in the back of my mind and enjoyed the ride... I was doing the same.
274	1	a	Somehow I reached the food-court and we chilled for a little bit at a table when I was staring at S and he was talking in a weird language and telling me to buy a book at Wal-Mart without moving his lips.  I asked him what he was saying and he told me I was hearing the Skytron monitor.  The Skytron was a huge TV above the food court that played constant commercials.  Anyway I stopped and watched the beautiful scene and let my worries fade when R looked at me and asked me if I heard the robot.  I was hearing a constant sound for a while now, not realizing it was a robot till R said something.  Normally I would get freaked out about something like this and hate myself for smoking bud.  This time I said , 'yeah' and sat back and relaxed and lived/loved life for what time I had left till the robot came to kill me.  It never did.
275	1	a	I came to realize later on that the robot was nothing merely other then the large jumble of voices eating their lunch and enjoying their life.... that made me happy to see that other people were enjoying their day also.  I was coming down from my high by the time we were leaving the mall, however that didn't stop Russ, Scott , and I from enjoying a laughing fit in the car so hard it made my chest hurt.
276	1	a	Smoking weed is fun... I believe it's something for everyone to try at least once and see how they like it.  As with beer, if I find myself getting messed up once a week or more, I'm going to cut back.  I have such a fun time each time I smoke the sweet herb, and I encourage everyone to be safe and have fun.

278	1	a	Let me start off by saying that I have been smoking cannabis and using many other substances off and on for about 6 years of my life, and I have yet to come across any bud that was this potent ever again, and maybe for the best.
279	1	a	It started on a Thursday night at a friends who I had agreed to sit for while he took a pretty high dose of DXM and Dramamine tablets (somewhere around 700mg DXM and 20 tablets of Dramamine). Well about two hours after taking the combination he wanted to go across the street to a friends and chill with some people. To my surprise he could actually walk without any problems whatsoever. Anyways, when we got over to A's house, there were 5 other friends over and they were all passing around a blunt and about to pack a bowl. They asked me if I wanted to smoke a bowl, so I agreed and went to sit down with them. I was the first to hit the bong, and I didn't want to get really high so I only took 1 hit. 'Only 1 hit, what could that do?', I mistakenly thought and later found out. Close to 10 minutes after my hit, I was feeling it come on pretty fast, thought it wasn't the usual cannabis high, it had a *weird* vibe to it.
280	1	a	So, I decided to stand up (usually helps when I'm feeling ill) to get rid of the nausea that had suddenly swept over me, and sure enough, it went away with no problems. I was coming up VERY fast and it was VERY intense. I wasn't really comfortable with the surroundings I was in so I asked my friends to watch B, my friend who took all the DXM and dram., while I went for a walk to clear my head. Well, I ended up walking home. The whole way home I was hallucinating all sorts of weird bugs and animals all around me. At one point on the way home, two old men standing next to a truck asked me if 'I was in the bar tonight'. I don't know if this had really happened so I just ignored it and kept walking my usual route home. About halfway home, every little spec on the road looked like a bug running around in the street, and I kept seeing bats and strange birds flying through the air above me, all making very strange noises similar to cars passing by on the highway. When I finally got home, I started fading in and out of consciousness, without knowing it until my body would 'jerk' and I would awaken.
281	1	a	I suddenly got nauseous again so I stumbled to the bathroom to vomit, but nothing came out. While I was sitting at the toilet, still fading in and out of consciousness, I thought I was standing in my friends backyard drinking malt liquor and kept saying 'I think I need to start heading home in a minute, the rice cakes will be ready soon.' Then I kinda 'popped' back into reality still feeling very nauseous. I never actually threw up, but came very close. Then next 40 minutes or so were spent sitting down at the toilet, falling in/out of reality, and falling over and hitting my head against the bathroom wall. When I finally came down enough to get up and move, I looked into the mirror and saw myself wearing a GIANT orange sombrero; very strange. When I moved into the living room, I collapsed on the couch and passed out until the next morning. And yes, I got a very good nights sleep.
282	1	a	For all of you who read this and think, 'cool', its was everything BUT cool. It scared the hell out of me. The whole time I had this overwhelming fear similar to the fear you get when on acid. On top of that, the stomach pains through the whole experience were terrible. And the friend who I was supposed to be sitting for, freaked out that night and went running naked through the neighborhood looking for his 'necklaces'.(it still amazes me that he could walk with no problems) But I hope this report helps those of you out there who think that there is no such thing as 'one hit shit', cuz there is, and this was by far, the most intense experience I've ever had with cannabis.

284	1	a	My name is Yuna, 16 and currently in 11th grade.
285	1	a	I'm a good kid. I'm smart, I go to school and respect elders. But I also do things that some people don't think very highly of.
286	1	a	Cigarettes. Alcohol. Pot. Speed. Ecstasy. Acid. Coke. Morphine.
287	1	a	I've never had a bad experience smoking weed in all the times I've done it. And it's pretty often - I usually smoke 2 or 3 times a week on average. Sometimes it's with friends and sometimes it's not. I buy from an ex of mine and he always gets me good stuff. For the most part, getting high is a nice experience.
288	1	a	Last week, I had my first bad trip. It had been a unusual time for me, I hadn't smoked any weed for about a month. It wasn't planned or anything, I just didn't find the time for it. Some of my brother's friends came over with some weed and asked if I wanted to smoke with them. 
289	1	a	I had always heard to never smoke weed from an Asian. And to that point, I hadn't. Even though I'm Asian myself, I never fit into that hoochie-ghetto-wigger kind very well and out of my group of friends, I'm really the only one who isn't white. But my brother is one of those gangster kind of Asians who only hang out with other gangstery Asians. I assumed the weed they brought was probably bleached or laced but I didn't think much of it. And besides, it had been a while since I had gotten high, so why not?
290	1	a	They rolled a fat blunt out of about a 30 of weed. We started passing it around the 4 of us and I was taking really big, monster hits. I wanted to get as much out of it as I could. I had about 10-15 big hits off of it, and a few shoties. It probably wasn't the greatest idea. I'm a tiny person. I'm only 5'2 and dont even make the 100 pound mark. But by then, I was too high to think about it too much.
291	1	a	At first, I was having a great time. I was really high and feeling really good. It lasted for about 20 minuites, when I started to get nauseous. I went into my room to lie down for a little bit, hoping it would take the nausea away, but it only got worse. I turned on the air conditioner full blast and stripped down to my bra and panties and tried to calm down. My heart was beating too fast and I was sweating like mad. I curled up on my bed and closed my eyes and tried to fall asleep but it didn't work.
292	1	a	When I had my eyes open, the entire room was spinning and twirling. Whenever I closed them, I got the strangest sensation that I was rolling foward, off my bed, even though I wasn't. I couldn't move the slightest bit or I was hit with extreme nausea. I couldn't even throw up because I hadn't eaten anything for a while. There were times I felt that the piece of my bed that I was lying on was hovering midair somewhere and things were flying around me. And I was overheated like crazy.
293	1	a	I'm not sure how much time passed. Later, I found out it was 45 minuites but it felt like hours. I eventually passed out and woke up an hour later, still feeling a bit nauseous but better. I drank some water and took an asprin to make my headache go away. I still had slight nausea for the rest of the night, but I wasn't burned at all. I made it okay.
294	1	a	But I'm never smoking weed from an Asian again.

297	1	a	Not long ago, my brother-in law scored a dime or two of good reefer from a guy at work.  I had come to visit, and he mentioned that he's like to try it (being less experianced than myself). Lacking rolling papers, the only smoking apparatus I had was an old 'zeppelin' on the floor of my car. after sharing a few hits each, we were feeling pretty good, starting to get a little buzzed, and the strangest thing happened...time slowed down!  I'm not talking about normal slow stoned, this was serious.  From what my sister reports (she was sober, watching us), a normal 5 minutes seemed like 4-6 hours to us.  Our thought processes seemed extremely fast, but breaks in the conversation were unusually long. Overall, we were probably high for the better part of 5 hours, but I can't begin to describe how long it felt.  I've never experianced this effect from Cannabis.  
298	1	a	Fortunately, the high was rather smooth, and not at all uncomfortable, but there were some strange side-effects that went along with it.  My bro got some serious munchies as a result of the stuff, and ate a whole jar of peanut butter.  I on the other hand had a single bite of chocolate cake, followed by the sensation that my mouth was 'glued shut' (BTW, the cake was REALLY GOOD!) the strange part is that my mouth was actually wide open, and my face was completely paralyzed. I found that I could neither move my jaw, nor feel anything touching my face during this time (an hour or two after smoking up).  I also felt very much disconnected from my hands, and motor dexterity in my fingers became sluggish, and delayed almost to the point of uselessness. these effects took about 3 hours to subside, and the next morning, I still felt somewhat stoned.   I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else.

300	1	a	Cannabis (1) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
301	1	a	I got a call from my friend one night, lets call her Betty Sue. She called to say that she was over at her Neighbor's (Sue Bee) House. Se told me to have my mom drop me off immideately. I could smell a good amount of almost sweet marijuana at the doorway. My mom didn't smell it. I sat down in the house and had one small hit from the bammer filled joint Betty Sue was smoking. it was definitetely not enough to have any  sort of effect, but it was the kind I could stay  up all night smoking for a good alert buzz if I had enough. We went out to get some food and shared a few more hits of bammer. By this time, the bammer wasn't having any psychoactive effect, but I could feel cottonmouth coming on, so I at least knew that when we smoked enough, there would be a pleasant mild high that I could enjoy. 
302	1	a	Sue Bee broke out the 'Blue Box' full of her stash. there was a sandwich bag full of bammer and I got excited, but there was one more thing. Green Bud. Now I had had green bud before, but this had a very stoney smell, Sue Bee said that it was new and real good (by the way, sue bee is about sixty to seventy years old) so I opted to try some. The taste was very sweet, probly what I had smelled coming in. We began passing around the pipe, filled with a full bud (enough to fill the bowl) and we refilled after a few minutes. I tried to hold it in, but it made me cough too much, which I didn't expect because the smoke was very very smooth and light tasting. And for a while, I noticed nothing. The onset was about five or ten minutes longer than normal. 
303	1	a	Finally it hit me. I didn't really come up, I actually hit the plateau immideately. I first noticed that I was in fact high (at the time I couldn't remember how that  felt and I couldn't actually feel anything, I just knew I was high) I started to remember what pot was usually like, and noticed that I did  not get cottonmouth like I do with the pot I usually smoke, and I had certainly never felt this clear headed after smoking so much (these were huge bowls, I had way more than one or two hits) I decided to stand up, and I noticed a slight swell in my limbs that spread to my whole body. Like I was being filled up with blood. I felt very heavy, I noticed that when I jumped, I only got about three inches off the ground When my jumping was usually about a foot normally and two feet when I am high and it feels like I am flying (It was probly a foot every time, my perception just changed) I eventually at down and let it fade. 
304	1	a	I would like to experiment with this type of green bud again and write a more thorough report and try more things. I would also like to examine it for other  plant material such as california poppy (I have noticed a similar effect mixing california poppy with damania).

307	1	a	Well, I figured I'd write this down in here too while I'm here and high both at once.
308	1	a	I started smoking the wacky tobaccy the summer after freshman year. 
309	1	a	I remember Maggie filled up a bong with stems she had left over and told me to smoke it, showed me how and said that it wouldn't get me high but it would put thc in my system so i'd  get really baked the real time i do it.
310	1	a	but as i was walking home from her house, I began to feel as though the street was rising and I was walking upwards.
311	1	a	Now i feel like im floating and letting my body come down a bit from the air so that i can type on the keyboard. or something real nice like that.
312	1	a	I notice that even though i ponder things when im not high, that's it's nothing unusual for me, its easier for me to do it right now, and my thoughts flow easily, they just click and connect like a puzzle.
313	1	a	i guess the brain power must shift from all the parts of the brain to specific spots....like from the part that governs memory to the part that governs thought processes. I dunno.
314	1	a	Sometimes I actualy become aroused when I smoke weed, which is odd. When one thinks of marijuana one does not think of being horny.
315	1	a	I get the munchies bad. I eat everything in the house. Like I can't get full and my stomach is rumbling. I think if you have cancer or aids or some other chronic (no pun intended) disease that depletes your hunger and makes you underweight, this can be a good thing, along with the pain relief.
316	1	a	For me, I have OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) which is an anxiety disorder where I can't quite worrying about stupid things no matter what anyone tells me, like if i am afraid that my hands have germs on them, and i freak out, yet I know it's not possible, the fear and such is so strong that i cant ignore it and wont believe my own mind. 
317	1	a	So when I smoke, I feel relaxed and light, and thinking about my fear just doesn't process in my mind, because it's too filled with the goodness of the leafy greens^^

319	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Health Benefits (32), General (1), Unknown Context (20)
320	1	a	Okay, I had only taken weed 3 times before this experience. It might be weird but I don't know, somehow the first two didn't have any effects on me. Of course it had some, but at least it wasn't as I had expected.
321	1	a	I got a friend, E , who's been smoking pot for over a year. He would come to school so high, wouldn't listen to the teachers, and stare around foolishly. He would tell me about the experiences he had while smoking weed and finally these made me try it.
322	1	a	Before marijuana, I had only smoked cigarrettes and taken alcohol, so I was a bit anxious about what could happen to me. The first time I smoked one joint, and honestly NOTHING happened to me. As I didn't get what I wanted from marijuana I wanted to do it again. That was a bit better and I felt high. But again, not as I wanted.
323	1	a	And here it comes..One day, E told me that his friend had got some strong weed and asked me if I wanted to go over and get high :) I couldn't say NO, because I wanted to have that feeling of highness so much. So we went to his house, prepared the bong , and started hitting.
324	1	a	1.. 2.. and I started feeling strange.. I was acting so different, I realised. But I could say to myself that 'I'm not high' 'I'm okay'. But with a look at the mirror, I saw my eyes half open, and bloodshot. I was having so much fun, we were listening to rap, and dancing wildly. I felt a little tired and sat on E's bed. He was sitting beside me singing. I lighted up a cigar and it's smoke got into my eyes, it hurt me so much and my eyes were all watery. I kept them closed for a few seconds and as I opened them THE WHOLE ROOM WAS FULL OF WATER.
325	1	a	I could see bubbles around the room just like I was in a pool or a sea. Things were floating and so was E's hair. Suddenly a blue shark, just like a cartoon passed behind E. I stared at it for a few moments and tried to realise what was happening. The shark made a few curves and faded away and I blinked to see it again but as I opened my eyes, everything was gone. I was in the room again, E was sitting there and staring at me blankly.
326	1	a	When I told him what happened , he was in a kind of shock because he had told me before that he hadn't ever had any hallucinations before so he was kinda jealous. It was a great experience, but I can't say anything about whether it is good or bad to use marijuana as I'm new. I just can say that it's fun!

329	1	a	I come from Germany so I guess there will be a lot of mistakes in the whole context - I want to appologize for that first. Okay I have to admit that I smoked weed a lot of times before but because I am not a smoker I really didn't get that high (because I didn't inhale it that deep and that long). I wanted to give it a last try because I really thought Marijuana is just boring and I couldn't imagine why people like that small not very intensive kick so much.
330	1	a	Me and a friend used about 0.5 g weed with tea. First we heated it in a microwave - then we started drinking it. Actually I tried to take weed oral like 2 times before which failed both cause I didn't eat it at all or I forget heating it - whatever this time should really be the last if it doesn't work... It was midnight when we used it so I know we should have got one hour left before it will have an effect on us but I doubted it anyway so we headed to Hanover City. It was an early Tuesday morning and nobody was on the streets when I first felt that something must have been changed - it was kind of more interesting and funny to look in all that windows of the closed stores.
331	1	a	Then we entered the station and it really went further very fast. So after a short while all was very funny and ridicolous. Walking was getting a problem because it was very hard to use one step for the other. Then we left the station again and get outside. We tried to talk to some people but we weren't able to do it - we only could make some noises and our converstion was getting more and more difficult maybe every 10th word was kind of sensible. 3 guys realized us and started laughing about us because we were behaving like robots - we just made noises and keep on walking. By the time one of them get the idea to rob us I got an unpleasant feeling and we went back to the station (btw we must have been crossing that station maybe 50 times that night!). Now I lost time and place control I mean I forgot in which direction we were heading and I wasn't able to speak one sentence because every time I forgot the beginning so it was no use.
332	1	a	To find the right way and walking itself were that hard that a short distance seemed to be like a long travel - the same with the time.By the time that I realized that 10 minutes really didn't pass by I got in panic and I was like: 'Does it ever stop again and all will it be okay? Maybe the drug dealer used some LSD on the grass and I will get mad...'
333	1	a	By that time I really felt like going to the hospital especially as we get so thirsty and the mouth were that try I can't tell...I was on heat and I didn't know wether I will get an heart attack or maybe I couldn't breathe anymore - but we found a book store which were opened by night so we entered it. We have been there like some hours before but there it was just cool. I just told the woman we only want to rest and get some drink and we won't make any trouble but then I saw her using the telephone - I got the paranoia that she would call the police... 40 minutes passed by and some people were supervising us - I realized it although they must have thought I couldn't take notice of them. My friend was sitting on a chair trying to read a book what of course was impossible - we didn't talk a lot anymore... I was walking and walking and walking arround the furnitures and talking to myself that I really don't have fun anymore and I want it to be over by now...
334	1	a	I wasn't that hungry anymore when I got the idea that my friend must be the devil because he rejected recognizing me and only sometimes I felt like he was back when he said: 'It's all cool - nothing to worry about'... suddenly two police men arrived and I got really angry cause that dumb woman really called them so we tried to leave the store and the police men were cool so all were cool... now I started coming down but then my friend wanted to drive and I jumped out of the car and took his keys cause I was afraid to die so we just hang out about another hour before I could accept driving home... after all this trip was really high and the following trips we made were more or less good but there were none what I would call a bad trip again... if I wouldn't have had that experience again I probably wouldn't use it anymore but now I really learned to use that stuff and we really had much fun but this is not the topic...

336	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1)
337	1	a	This happened two days ago...it was such an unusual experience, I thought I'd share with you guys :)
338	1	a	I've been smoking cannabis for about three years now, so I'd say I'm pretty experienced with joints, bongs etc. Anyway, I was in college around 11am, and met up with a long time stoner friend (lets call him Harris) in the student union. I mentioned I didn't feel like going to lectures that day, and he suggested we have a waterfall each.
339	1	a	If you don't know what a waterfall is, its usually a plastic soda bottle (in this case 500ml). You punch a hole in the bottom, put a gaze over the top, and put the cannabis in that. Then fill the bottle with water (cover the hole!), and burn in the cannabis as you let out the water. Then suck in that white smoke baby. Result: Some seriously good pure hash. Anyways, we had one each (I hadn't had a waterfall before), and decided to head outside on the campus lawn (gorgeous weather). After about 5 minutes, I could tell this was gonna be a strange buzz. Sounds were getting a little distorted, and everything seemed to be moving and sliding around slightly. About 10 minutes after taking the waterfall, my mind just clicked, and suddenly I was really, really trippy! I really can't describe it, but basically my mind was absolutley racing, new thoughts coming into my head every few seconds, and every ten seconds or so I just had to tap myself on the shoulder metaphorically, to remind myself where I was and who I was.
340	1	a	I looked up in the sky and saw four airplanes, two heading one way and two the other. I suddenly panicked, and said to my friend 'This is it man, it's World War Three' - The airplanes looked exactly like missiles - nukes on their way to their respective targets. It was really creepy, because it honestly felt like this was it, nuclear war.
341	1	a	Luckily, after a few minutes this feeling went, and I just went with the buzz, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Maybe it was the pot, maybe it was the waterfall, but it was simply the most intense buzz I'd every gotten off cannabis.
342	1	a	So, what did I learn? Well, its hard at first, but I think you just have to let go...don't try to control or stop the intensity, because it only turns it into a bad buzz. Try to remain relaxed, and just melt into it. My mistake was to try and keep a grip on who and where I was - My tip, don't.

345	1	a	I started smoking a couple of months ago and have since become a more laid-back person who feels more at peace with her life and the world.  Marijuana is so commonplace and such a part of my life now that I hardly think of it as a drug, yet I have had a couple of experiences that were definitely mindblowing and reminded me that weed is more than food.  I had heard people speak of seeing sounds and feeling colors, etc. when they were tripping off acid, etc. but I never believed that such effects could be triggered by marijuana.
346	1	a	However, not too long ago, me and a couple of friends packed a bowl with some really potent KB and after about three hits I was really tripping hard.  I was sitting in a car in a parking lot at night listening to trance music.  My eyelids were drooping and I could not move my body at all, not that I wanted to.  The music was enthralling--I could actually see it.  Everyone knows that smoking makes music better and I definitely appreciate it more when I am high, but seeing music is something else.  It was as if each facet of the music, and there were probably at least twenty--the bassline, the main melody, that strange clicking noise in the background, etc.--every noise took on a visual shape.  I could see every line of the music moving and dancing to its beat.  It was beautiful, absolutely breathtaking, until one of the shapes--a pink ball of light--began circling my head repeatedly.
347	1	a	First I was dizzy, then I became nauseous and my friend laughed as she changed the song because I was groaning that the music was making me sick.  Who would have thought you could see music and feel its effects?  Ever since this experience I have better recognized the beauty of music when you are high, though never again have I actually seen the sounds.  Marijuana enhances all the senses though, and on other occasions I have felt lights.  Driving down the highway at night, the streetlamps seemed to stroke my body and the feeling was intense.  In conclusion, marijuana is a wonderful substance that can open your body and mind to otherworldly experiences.

349	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
350	1	a	At about eight oclock I met my friend, whom I'll call Kathy. She and I walked to a small wooded park, where earlier that afternoon we'd found a perfect place to smoke. We arrived at the designated area, I packed a bowl, and we lit up. We got about two hits apiece off each bowl (I packed them really small because I knew how potent it was) and after the third bowl, we decided to stop. I was feeling a little buzzed and Kathy said she wasn't really feeling it at all. So we packed up the dope, the flashlight we'd brought, and the lighters and set out for the road. 
351	1	a	However, as soon as we stepped off the small concrete platform where we'd been standing onto the grass, it hit. Everything that I looked at was very, very pixellated, as though I were looking at a low-resolution digital image. Each separate part of my body, especially my hands and feet, felt like they were in different, discrete planes of existence. All of my senses, except touch in certain cases, were incredibly heightened. I especially remember thinking that my hearing had been augmented. I was twitching, slightly. I was so unable to judge distances that I didn't trust myself to light a cigarette.
352	1	a	However, without a doubt the strangest part of this whole experience was the way in which I perceived reality and the passage of time. For at least two and a half hours (in real-time...For me it seemed like days), I had a feeling of unreality. At first I thought I was dreaming, but I realized that that didn't quite cover what I was feeling. So I thought some more, and the best explanation that I can come up with is that I felt like I was an image on a movie screen...That I was a physical piece of a movie that someone else was watching. I had a pervasive, at times frightening feeling that nothing I did had any consequences because none of it was real. 
353	1	a	In terms of my awareness of my surroundings...It's difficult to describe this without being really confusing and roundabout...The way I saw and thought about things was very similar to any movie or movie preview or something where the editors take several clips of a particular scene and place them all one after the other, even though in reality five or ten minutes may have passed between each clip. I would exchange a few words with Kathy, then we'd both fall into silence for a moment, and then I'd look back up at her and realize that I'd completely forgotten she was there, and I would have no memory of just having talked to her. Usually for those first few moments of realization I'd think she was a hallucination I was having (eventually, that began really to unnerve me, so I asked her to hold onto my arm, which made it a little better, but I was still pretty startled every time I looked at her). I had many consecutive trains of thought, but they were all very brief and died out one after the other. So, the end result of all of that is that everything felt incredibly disjointed. 
354	1	a	That, combined with the fact that I felt like I was in a film, made last night one of the strangest nights of my life. I think I enjoyed it, though I think I would have enjoyed it more if Kathy and I had spent most of the night in a place where we knew we were going to be safe, such as one of our houses (both of our sets of parents were home, which is why we stayed out until it wore off a little, and that took about three hours).

357	1	a	This report is intended to attest to the extent that Cannabis is capable of putting you out like a light. One night, my friends and I decided to have a little jam session at a friend's garage. This entailed playing music with little or no actual cohesion, and smoking lots of weed.
358	1	a	Before entering the experience, I was not noticably tired. Keep this in mind. Also, I have a relatively low tolerance to weed. 
359	1	a	T+00 The first bowl gets passed around as we are setting up our equipment. The weed is of fairly good quality, and by the time we are all done smoking, I'm starting to feel fairly stoned.
360	1	a	We play music for a while. We have only one light in the entire loft, a lamp pointing straight up. This caused the surroundings to be either illuminated in light or cast in pitch black shadow. The intense contrast in lighting might have contributed to the experience.
361	1	a	T+90 I eat a meatball sub, and smoke more weed. I was VERY hungry at this point and wolfed down the sandwich. 
362	1	a	T+95 I finish sandwich and realize that energy level is declining rapidly.
363	1	a	We play more music for a while. I am still sitting on the couch as I have no inclination to get up, being very tired and very stoned. Starting to loose motor coordination.
364	1	a	T+140 We smoke yet another bowl, which in retrospect, given my level of exhaustion, was a really stupid idea. I still had to drive home, which fortunately was only 20 minutes away.
365	1	a	T+170 I bid my friends goodbye, and climb the ladder (we were in a loft) down to my car. Climbing down can only be described as choppy and unsteady, and I'm sure my balance was horrible at that point.
366	1	a	I had told my parents that I was going to be home by 11 as it was a school night. They are usually asleep by then, so it wouldn't matter how stoned I would be when I finally arrive. However, it was only 10pm. I had an hour to kill, so I figured I'd drive my incredably stoned and out of it self down to the beach parking lot, and chill out there for a while.
367	1	a	T+190 I arrive at the parking lot. It's now 10:20 and I'm still extremely stoned and tired, I make the foolish mistake of 'resting my eyes.'
368	1	a	T+310 (120 minutes later) I wake up, realize I am an hour and 15 minutes late, and zoom home. I had slept off most of the effects of the weed, and was feeling refreshed. 
369	1	a	Luckily, I didn't get into any sort of trouble for this incident. But, it did teach me that Cannabis can make one extremely tired, to the point of not being able to keep oneself awake unless one's eyes are open. Although random slumber is not necessarily a bad thing, I definitely think I should not have been driving that night, as I very well could have fallen asleep at the wheel. Be forewarned.

372	1	a	I was visiting the hippy town of Woodstock for the weekend with some older friends (most of my friends are over 30 and I am in high school). I suspected that pot might be part of the day's activities, but I wasn't sure if my friends thought I was old enough to become one of the stoner crowd.
373	1	a	We arrived at an art collector's house to hang out before we went swimming. My friend J pulled out his pipe, and a little box with a bud in it, and put it in front of me and walked away. I took it upon myself to prepare it and share it with everyone else. My first inhale was smooth, maybe because I had been around the smoke before, and my lungs were more tolerant. I held it in long, hoping to get some amazing high that is spoken of in movies and cloudy rooms. I took two more hits afterward, just to ensure some reaction from the stuff.
374	1	a	After we finished, we went to a swimming hole by the waterfalls. This was very cool. On the way there, I was hearing my favorite CD for the first time, all over again. Every sound was a perfect harmony to my mood. It was beautiful. The water was cold, and the reflections of light on the water got my mind to wander. I closed my eyes and thought about breathing underwater, and floating in a tranquil paradise. Somewhere in this stream of thought my parents came to mind, and I began to feel guilty. This was a major bring down from my high. I quickly deminished the thought, but I couldnt get back what was lost.
375	1	a	The day went on, and it wore off slowly. I was in a generally calm, peaceful state of mind for the entire day. I do recommend this stuff to everyone who likes to relax and dream, but only in moderation. In excess, this does no good.

377	1	a	I tried weed for the first time when I was in grade 8, when I was 13 years old. The first time I 'tried' it I didnt feel anything at all. After about 3 times of trying it and having feeling nothing, I felt that I had a different kind of brain than other people and that weed wouldnt affect me. 
378	1	a	One Friday during school my friend 'S', who has been smoking me the weed for the last few times, asked me if I wanted to smoke again. As I was still wondering about the feeling that weed could give me, I agreed to come over and smoke with him.  Between 4 people, we smoked two joints, and about 5 big bowls. I averaged it out later that I myself probably smoked 1 gram of weed. 
379	1	a	Like the many times before, nothing appeared different than normal life. I just went upstairs and got a drink of water. After I got my drink I walked over to my friend C and began to talk with her. I forget what we talked about, but one time during the conversation I went to have a drink of water from my glass, when I realized that I didnt have a glass in my hand.
380	1	a	Hey C, didnt I have a glass of water in my HAHAHAHA I began to laugh uncontrollably at the fact that I thought I had water in my hand. After what felt like 10 minutes of laughing, I turned to my friend D and yelled, What is going on! 
381	1	a	When he said that, I immediately started to explore my surroundings, finally I was high. So THIS is what I was trying to experience. So THIS is what I was trying to experience. After that more of the weed kicked in and eventually I realized I was really stoned.
382	1	a	We than walked downstairs and sat on chairs in Cs room. All of my other friends were talking with each other while I was sitting in my chair stoned off my ass. During the time I was sitting in my chair I kept feeling like somebody added weights to the front of my body, making it hard to sit up straight. I would fall over and than catch myself and sit up straight and look around the room. The whole time this was going on a felt bloated and close to throwing up. 
383	1	a	All of a sudden I felt that my mouth was extremely dry. I then realized, for possibly the fifth time, that I didnt have a drink in my hand anymore. I then told everyone in the room several times that I was going to get a drink, and finally I did.
384	1	a	I began to walk up the stairs and then all of a sudden I mind-blanked into the kitchen. I felt like the trip up the stairs never happened. As I was in the kitchen all I could think of was how I got up here. Then as I saw the sink I remembered that I was looking for my glass that I had previously so that I could get some water. After I had found my glass I began to fill it up with water, which is when I had another mind-blank.
385	1	a	At one moment I was filling up my glass with water, at the next I was walking down the stairs and sat down in my chair. When I sat down I began to drink my water. Right after I started, my friends were laughing at me, I didnt know why and was tripping out to hard at them laughing to ask why they were laughing.
386	1	a	In between laughing, my friend C came out with the words salt in your water? 
387	1	a	I then looked at my glass and I was murky. I then tasted my water and it tasted horrible. So I put it down in awe at what my brain did while I had no control over it. 
388	1	a	We sat in the basement for a while and then we had to leave. Cs room was in the basement and her window was level with the ground so for fun we decided to climb out the window to leave. I had a little bit of trouble, but when I got outside I felt awesome. To this day I still enjoy being outside when Im stoned. I feel like I enjoy the natural beauty of the earth more when Im stoned. 
389	1	a	While I was walking I felt that my heart was beating really fast. Every once and a while, I would be walking by myself, and then I would run to catch up with my friends to walk with them. After that I would usually have a mind-blank, and I would be behind them and have to catch up with them again.
390	1	a	We walked around my town for a while and then I went home. I snuck in quietly and trying to act normal told my mom that I was going to bed. I turned on the TV in my room and watched TV until I fell asleep.
391	1	a	In the morning I felt a little fuzzy and still messed up but I could still think and function fine. After a while I became completely normal, and I was excited about what I had just experienced the night before.
392	1	a	It is more than three years later and I have been smoking a fair bit of weed ever since, about once a week, and always enjoy it. 
393	1	a	After my first time being stoned I have never had the mind-blanks that I had that evening. My first time being stoned was a weird experience, a taste of the other side of life.
394	1	a	On a final note I would like to say to be cautious when trying weed for the first time. You may find things to be very unknown and messed up, but remember that you will be fine in a couple hours and that you will not die, as I thought many time during the trip that I was having a heart attack and/or was about to die.

397	1	a	One night I was at a friends house, and we had just got back from my sisters high school graduation. We all (5 people) went to my friends room, and lit up some great Boone (north carolina) Nug bud. It taste so good I could have died. I could feel it kick in as I took the first hit. We all sat and talked and laughed, but then Thomas took out a rolling paper. Oh, shit I was already in over my head. I didn't think I could handle any more, but it was just the kind of bud I couldn't pass up. Do you know what I mean?
398	1	a	Thomas started rolling it and showed us how to roll a ' mully' joint. It was so fucking funny. He was acting like it was an infomercial. We where all tripping out, he is so funny. Then we smoked another one and talked and laughed. But here is were the good part starts. Every one left the room , but I stayed in the room. The reason for this is I usually trip unusually to much. So, I stayed and tripped.
399	1	a	The first part was me sitting down in an air bubble chair. I was thinking of me just sitting on air, and that must have affected my trip coming up. Here it goes. I was just sitting there thinking of things, and all of a sudden I was blocked in by bricks. Not regular bricks but air bubble bricks (the only way to explain it). The bricks were like the bubble chair I was sitting in. I could not possibly move, the bricks were holding me tight. I closed my Eyes thinking I could lose the trip, but as soon as I did I got sucked into a portal. A portal of infinite knowledge (as always as I trip). I drift and drift. It was telling a story, and a great one at that. Life is great, you have to hold on to the moments and create new ones. I was literally taking deep refreshing breaths just to savour the moment. I can't remember every moment of this experience so I won't ramble. Every time I trip it is spiritual and I learn more and more about the actual world that surrounds us all. I hope you have liked this if you didn't have a wonderful day anyway.

401	1	a	Cannabis (1) : General (1), Mystical Experiences (9), Small Group (2-9) (17)
402	1	a	As a prelude to my journey into the water pipe dimension I must confront the reader with the facts that I have tried the sweet herb a good 10 or so times before and have used a gravity bong but not a water, and it was a great experience! 
403	1	a	The day started off cold and dreary.  I woke from bed and went to my friends house.  The friend whom I was picking up just turned 18 and wanted to buy something to smoke out of by himself, so I told him I would take him to a shop that sells them; and I did.  One of the grayest and colorless days I have ever known passed by us on that trip.  Once we got there we selected a nice straight bong with about a 2 inch mouth piece.  It fit my mug nicely as it did his.  We made the trip home talking quiet a bit how hungry we were, yet we didnt stop anywhere at all to eat which was a blessing in disguise I guess, it saved us money.
404	1	a	The time is now around 1 pm and we are sitting at home admiring his new water bong.  Again it is just my friend Justin and I.  We still didnt think to get anything to eat when suddenly the doorbell rang and in walked my pothead friend Scott.  We could always get weed from him and today was no exception, we decided to buy and eighth and ended up smoking it in his car with the water bong.  Justin got the first hit and I saw him draw no smoke into the chamber and my doubts were starting to arise.  The bong went to Scott and he took one of the most monster hits I ever saw and didnt choke.  I couldnt wait to try it, and after what seemed like a day it came back to me and I settled it into my lap and put my mouth to it.  I prayed to have a good high and hoped I got really stoned off of the bong.   I drew a big hit into the chamber and cleared it expecting to kill myself coughing but it was so nice and smooth! The hit I took was almost like a cigarette! I should mention that this bud was nothing more then powerful oregano, really nothing good.... we didnt care though, it was working it seemed.  That is to say, it was weed but a very inferior quality as I judged by the mass amounts of seeds and stems, and just the way it smoked.  I went on and took about 10 hits off the bong and we ended up smoking the rest of the eighth.
405	1	a	The rest of the day was a blur but I remember the first of it, sitting in the car marveling how complex the scenery is when I realized I had no idea where I was.  I began to think we were near my house when I forgot why I was thinking what I was thinking.  I never had such bad short-term memory loss like that before.  I literally would think of one thing, and then either forget what I was thinking about in the middle of thinking it, or space out and just realize I was spacing ten minutes later.  I wasnt thinking I was high until right then and it just hit me I was stoned off my ass.  I couldnt do anything but just smile with a big grin on my face and giggle at nothing.  We were lost in the city for a while in the car, maybe about 45 minutes when suddenly I realized a road and yelled out of no where 'AAAHH HOUSE NEAR HERE!' I couldnt think of what to say and after a while it ended up we were nowhere even near the city anymore somehow, which to this day I can never figure out how that happened.  
406	1	a	So we headed toward another friends house that lives close to me.  His name was also Justin.  We relaxed there and I had some things to eat such as chips and ice cream. The second Justin looked a lot like Jim Morrison, especially with the hair and I kept thinking it was actually Jim and flipping out.  I could feel Mary Jane clutching at my brain, and it felt as though the weed lifted a blanket off my brain and I had so much more space for all my thoughts to go to now.... if that makes any sense.
407	1	a	We talked for a while and watched some TV.  The only other thing I can remember until that night is just staring at my friends face and watching it glow then turn into another friends face.  The second Justin turned on Any Colour You Like by Pink Floyd and told me to close my eyes and watch the colors.  That was a great show; it felt as if my body was being cut in half but in a pleasant way.  The feeling went up into my tooth and made my tooth feel fuzzy.  I then started to feel like liquid and the music made me feel as though my liquid self was slowly going upwards for some reason in a quelling motion.
408	1	a	I eventually came down that day but I had a lot of 'brain farts' I guess you call them.  For instance I went into a gas station, one is in my town, and another in the city over and they both look the same inside.  I looked at the soda fountain and all of a sudden I couldnt remember which one I was at or how I got there.  I asked my friend and he just thought I was saying that to make myself look still high, but I really didnt know which one we were at.  Then later on I was dining out, and scooping myself some sprinkles for ice cream and I dipped the sprinkle spoon in the hot chocolate by accident and just left it there and walked away while the people I was with were screaming my name, I knew they were too but I just didnt register  in my mind to turn around.  The rest of the night everything just seemed so cool and the world around me was such a nice place.  I had a wonderful long lasting feeling of euphoria long after it, and I still feel as everything is going to work out great.
409	1	a	Anyway, this about wraps up my first try on a water bong, and let me tell you it was the highest I have ever got.  Out of all my times when I got high, it was the best from the water bong.  I was also surprised at how easy it hits.

411	1	a	A brief substance history before the experience. Before today 2002 was the last time I had ever done drugs. I had been clean of any substance abuse for 15 years. My health has been getting the best of me for so long that I have been scared to do anything, much less have an eye opening experience. I made one mistake, and that was underestimating the potency of this strain. I was sick to my stomach for a good while before it passed. It was too much for me, and too strong. This weed was no joke.
412	1	a	With a blunt rolled by my brother ready we go outside and I spend a little time in meditation before I spark it up. What begins to take place while we are smoking this blunt is the deepest conversation I can remember having with anyone. My tolerance is at square one here so as far as you know this is like a first time experience. 
413	1	a	Within 10 minutes I am in another world. I am beginning to feel the effects of this blunt hit me like a ton of bricks. Everything I feel, say, and do begins to feel like a dream, but it's real life. Everything I feel, say, and do begins to feel like a dream, but it's real life. Me and my brother start having a deep conversation about things that nobody understands but us two. Out of nowhere I ask the question 'How have I made it this far?'. I promise you that I have never asked a deeper question in my whole lifetime and I have had 5 surgeries in the past 7 years, plus a near death experience with Pneumonia so I have came close to not making it a time or two. At this time I am bawling and letting so much out I begin to make myself speechless because what I am sharing with my younger brother is some real life stuff that needed to come out. After talking for a while longer I decide to take a nap because I am emotionally drained, and far away in another place. 
414	1	a	When I wake up from a short nap I decide to order a Pizza, and watch some LIVE PD. I enjoy my meal while laughing at folks on tv getting arrested for various crimes. 
415	1	a	Although this experience was rough, it taught me something. I need to be more open, and have more deep conversations with folks instead of being so quiet all of the time. It's hard to talk when life has humbled you on a level you can't begin to understand. For some reason I have made it this far. I have survived it all.
416	1	a	One day I will smoke weed again, but it won't be for a while. I have a great life, and I'd like to keep it that way.

419	1	a	My experiences with marijuana are very similar every time, but very enjoyable. I decided I had to write this report about it because of the amazing similarities between my experiences and those of another user. I will use one experience of mine that had all the things I normally feel, only more extreme because I was more high than usual.
420	1	a	There is a girl that goes to our school who lives in a rather nice apartment downtown (we live in a small town, so downtown isnt much), but her parents were in Europe for a few weeks and she let us smoke in her apartment. On this occasion, she wasnt even home when we were smoking. But anyway I was smoking with my best friend and one of his friends, who Im also pretty well acquainted with. So we smoked almost an eighth, just us three, and I went to sit on the couch. 
421	1	a	Many times I meditate while high because I can focus more without distracting thoughts Many times I meditate while high because I can focus more without distracting thoughts, but this day I decided I was so high, I should probably just enjoy it. All my friends know that with me, I get high very easily, and I have intense highs. For whatever reason, my highs are in my head, body, and eyes at the same time. So when I sit still I shiver and shake and twitch, but also get distorted visuals. Well sitting on the couch I started feeling like the couch was falling backwards all the time, as if I was on a small, but fast ferris wheel going in reverse. I could actually feel the wind against my skin (I later realized this was an exaggeration of the wind from the fan above me). Then I closed my eyes and got some closed eye visuals, which are somewhat consistent with every time I get high. It seems to me that these visuals are of things I saw as an infant. For example, I saw my house, but it was an incredibly simplified version, with only one floor, and only one level of roof which slanted to the back. But it was most definitely my house. I think I was somehow remembering the way I saw or thought of my house when I was just an infant. I also saw a pattern that could either be an eye or a loose outline of a house, but that pattern appears in my head almost every time. 
422	1	a	Eventually I decided to return to my friends who were sitting at the counter together but both were very intently staring at the counter-top. So I got a granola bar, which was somewhat hard to chew but every time I opened my jaw the stickiness sent waves of euphoria through my body. It felt so good. Then I sat down again and decided I would travel down the rabbit hole. I closed my eyes and could easily visualize a rabbit hole. I pushed down through the hole by chewing, and those waves pushed the dirt aside. The rest of the day pretty much went on like this.
423	1	a	For the next few days I felt more refreshed and optimistic than I have in as long as I can remember.

426	1	a	Every month or so, I buy a bit of cannabis from a good friend of mine, usually 1/16th of an oz., as this time. I tend to consume all of it in a period of 3-4 days remaining under its influence from waking to sleep unless work or school get in the way. During this time, I tend to write, draw, tell stories, come up with plans, and all of the regular experiences associated with cannabis use. My 'Stoned Philosophy' has been subject of many jokes by friends My 'Stoned Philosophy' has been subject of many jokes by friends, but often enough they listen openly, assuming I am indeed speaking from more than a simply 'stoned' perspective. 
427	1	a	I bought from this friend of mine with the intent of having a regular time, as per my usual. Listen to music, write some stories, play some videogames, and watch some movies. After having been less-than-sober for many hours, I began to watch a movie. Across the Universe, a movie I had been wanting to see for some time, having been told by many people how wonderful it was and my undying love for The Beatles. John Lennon is one of the reasons I got into philosophy, in fact. 
428	1	a	The movie started out very strongly, and as I lit up another bowl, I started singing along to some of the songs that I knew, although the remakes had rhythms I was not used to. It was perhaps twenty minutes into this movie that I started seeing it as the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, a feeling I still hold some months later. The utter perfection of the 'humanity' in the movie made me weep several times. By the end of the film, I had decided upon what I wanted to accomplish with much of my life. As a college student, I have been slightly indecisive about my major, where to go in life, and what to do. The character Jude, although fictitious, finalized ideas I had been having for some time. I knew I wanted to work on the wrongs of the world, and the best way I see is to start from the ground up; what people think. People think by what they know, and they know by what they are taught. 
429	1	a	I am a History major, soon to be attending another year of college, in order to teach people in the same position I am the wrongs humans have perpetrated, the great things we have done, in hopes of bettering mankind. Something I think all people need to work towards. 
430	1	a	In all of my experiences with multiple substances, I have never felt so 'right' as I did that night. I have never felt so 'right' as I did that night. I called members of my family, telling them of my revelation, of my new insight, and every one of them has helped me in working towards this goal, which is still a long way off. Through cannabis induced rants, silly ideas, a completely irrational fear of Zerglings, and all other foolish, but fun, things associated with my cannabis experiences, 'weed' really helped me. I am happier now than I have been in some time, even with the constant stress around me. I know that, due to a simple little plant and a movie, life will be completely worth all the hardship just to pass on any knowledge I am able, to hopefully better our so often ignorant species.

432	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Glowing Experiences (4), General (1), Alone (16)
433	1	a	Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] 
434	1	a	It was a day pretty much like most others. I was still in high school at this point, hanging out with my buddies who I'll call N and C. After school ended I drove them both home before heading to work. When I was dropping N off he said, 'Pick me up after work, I got something.'
435	1	a	I figured he meant he had bought some buds, as we were all pretty much potheads by this point. I finished work (I do construction) and was tired and achy as I pulled into N's driveway. I picked them both up (C was living at N's due to familial problems), and we started driving down toward my neighborhood. We parked the car at the end of a road that went down to the harbor. The spot was relatively secluded so we got out and packed a bowl of weed. N told me he had found the bag in the school parking lot that day.
436	1	a	We sat on a piece of driftwood watching heat lightning while we smoked two bowls. I noticed the smoke had a sort of 'mentholish' taste to it... kind of cool and minty. But sort of gross and chemical. In any event, I didn't like it much, but I figured weed is weed.
437	1	a	After a short time we all became agitated, we couldn't stop shifting our weight and fidgeting, talking all kinds of nonsense. I could hear my blood rushing through my veins and feel my heart pounding in my chest. At this point I kept saying, 'Dude, I'm dieing man!' over and over again.
438	1	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
439	1	a	We wandered around the beach, a total mess, for a few hours. Then I felt safe to drive again and we went around our town, going into the village and parking near Town Pond. It is this little pond next to the cemetary near the ocean. We sat there watching cars drive by, I noticed the tail lights left behind blurs as they went.
440	1	a	I had never taken any drug stronger than pot or mushrooms before this day, and the experience was slightly frightening, but ended up being pretty funny too. I felt sort of numb and hysterical, like a weird drunk in addition to a spacey high feeling.
441	1	a	We all went home and I ended up laying around in bed feeling weird for a little while before falling asleep. The next day I felt pretty burnt.
442	1	a	We later concluded that the pot could have been laced with PCP after hearing about some similar baggies going around our school. This was my first, and likely only experience with this drug.

444	1	a	I've been smoking cannabis for the past few years now. I started when I was 15. I've had different kinds of trips but this one was what I guess a 'Trip' is supposed to be. 
445	1	a	A friend hooked us up with Malana Cream which is grown in Malana, India. It's one of the best quality hash you can get in the world. No kidding. We rolled them and we smoked. It was after the 4th Joint (Shared by 3 people), I was certain that I'm getting fucked.
446	1	a	Constant white flashes. Then white circles around the corner of my eye. Sound sensitive, that usually happens. I couldn't eat, it just didn't want to go down.
447	1	a	I had only slept for 3 hours the previous night which is obviously a big mistake.  I had trouble keeping my eyes open and I was a bit scared because one of my friends who is quite a sober person ate a few pieces of cake filled with 72 grams of weed and he was hospitalized after he fainted, haha. I obviously didn't want to faint and be hospitalized which kept me at bay. So I went home and lied down on the bed. 
448	1	a	Then I felt this sensation around my chest, I can't say it was a burning sensation. I don't know but in my mind it felt like something bright inside my chest in my mind it felt like something bright inside my chest. Then I felt like I floating above my body. Separated from my body. At that very point, it felt great. I never knew I could hallucinate like this on hashish. Though I have never done Heroin, Acid etc. I do remember telling myself during the trip 'Fuck I'm floating, really!' I was back and running after 30 mins then, though I felt pretty lazy through out the day.
449	1	a	There is actually one more thing which isn't really big but but its been 2 weeks since then and I have yellow light flashes out of nowhere. It has happened to me 4-5 times this week. Sometimes I feel like the earth is shaking or a feeling of losing balance I guess but I'm pretty much still. 
450	1	a	Today I did think about these yellow flashes and the earth shaking thing and its kinda weird. I thought about all those people who have spiritual experiences through drugs. I'm a non believer though. But it was well worth the trip.

452	1	a	Cannabis - Hash (93) : Hangover / Days After (46), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
453	1	a	I was in a party, an a friend of mine was smoking a joint. I gave 2-3 puffs from it, I wasnt a frequent smoker, just once in a while if someone offered. This pot was very pure, not the dried one, so it hit pretty hard, really quick. The party was really loud and I sat in a couch as I started to feel overwhelmed by the voices of everyone. I catched isolated words, but every word I heard was reminding me of a memory of a conversation I had with different people at different ocasions long ago, where that word was used. They were all memories from high school, at gave me a frightful feel of meaning and irreality.
454	1	a	I think I closed my eyes, I dont remember, just everything went very dark. I panicked everything went very dark. I panicked. The whole world had faded away and I didn´t know what happened. I started to think of the reasons why this happened. First I thought I died and I felt bad for my parents. Second I thought maybe I became crazy and I wasnt aware of reality but I was truly institutionalised and I felt even worse. Then I started to feel like I was floating. I was floating in the dark and I couldnt feel my body. I was sure suddenly, the world had ended. Like it had exploded with some asteroid and that it happened so quickly that anyone had time to be aware of its own death. This certainty made me angry, bexause I was still conscious, and I'm not religious. To be aware after dying wasnt something I was expecting, and I felt annoyed by it.  
455	1	a	I started to feel like I was drifting, like falling, and I started thinking of everything that was lost, of everyone that died and that no one had time to say goodbye. I felt so alone and sad. I was cursing the fact that I still existed, I was so alone and afraid and thinking how much time is this going to last? Eternity? Will I join the others or is everyone alone in it one space like me forever? 
456	1	a	As I continue falling I tried to calm myself and I started to feel like I was falling through membranes. I started to feel like I was falling through membranes. Every membrane was a state, like I was growing or maturing, from one human condition into another state. As time passed and I continue to fall through this stage, I felt simpler, like a speck of dust lost in space. No longer feeling the need of everything I left behind in my previous life.
457	1	a	This lasted what I felt it was a long time, until a friend of mine shaked my shoulder and asked me If I was alright. I still had a shoulder. I opened my eyes. I had eyes. I was still in the party and my friend told me I sat there for like ten minutes. 
458	1	a	I was snapped out of it but still pretty high so I asked if I could go lay down in a bedroom. I was calm now because I knew it was just a trip so I fell asleep easily until it was time to go, a couple of hours later and I was feeling normal by then. 
459	1	a	It was a disturbing but interesting experience.

461	1	a	Cannabis (1) : Difficult Experiences (5), General (1), Large Group (10+) (19)
462	1	a	I'm a quite regular user of cannabis, I often buy half ounces and sort out little gatherings of a few people. 
463	1	a	I bought a half ounce for a night, expecting 3 people (including myself) to turn up, O and D. I got home with my stash and rolled up a big joint with about 1/4oz in it. Only O turned up, and we walked up a hill to one of our usual haunts, a nice hilltop bench with a brilliant view of the sky. It was around 8pm this time, and already getting hard to find the floor underneath the cover of trees. We sat down, and sparked up the joint. O took a few tokes on it before curling up on the bench. I proceeded to smoke the rest of it. We started talking about other drugs and whether we would or wouldnt do them, and then started looking at shapes in the sky. O rolled up another joint, just a kingsize one, and started smoking it.
464	1	a	Light clouds quickly flowed through the stars and the last of the sunlight died. 
465	1	a	As I neared the end of the joint, we started saying little things that just had us laughing for ages. I started thinking of everything good and bad in life, and then started to feel quite sick, like I'd drunk too much alcohol. This passed shortly, and then my right leg started shaking uncontrollably. O laughed, because I was shaking the bench, and then all of a sudden my left leg started too. We laughed at this for about 5 minutes and then decided to head off to a set of tennis courts in the hope that some other people would be there. We walked in, and lay down on the tennis courts. I stared straight up at the sky and started thinking of when I was a little kid; I used to stare up at the sky during the day, the white clouds against the blue skies. Now I had grey clouds against a black sky. I kept thinking of all the ways I'd changed, how everything had gone wrong, how all my aspirations burned and all my love lost. I'd grown up and I'd hated it.
