1	2	a	Once we were there, and we stayed there from 12:00 to 6:30 AM, it felt like time had completely halted. It didnt fast forward or rewind uncontrollably, it just... Stopped. We wondered if the sun was ever going to come back up. When it finally did after what felt like days, we stopped tripping almost immediately. The come down was so smooth that by 8:00 AM we happily drove to McDonalds with no signs of intoxication other than a beautiful afterglow. 
2	2	a	It was unbelievable. My body and mind are usually exhausted at the end of an intense trip, but for once I felt as though the acid had given me life and energy. Its been a few days since the trip and I still feel incredible! Its been very easy for me to integrate the experience into my life, which is surprising given how profound it was. It intrigued to me to think how impactful a positive psychedelic experience like mine could be on so many of the people I know that havent tried these drugs yet, but I can see why theyre so timid about it. For me, tripping feels like the most adult thing one can possibly do. Its heavy metal, its alien, and if one does it right, its the ultimate ecstasy.

4	2	a	LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Hangover / Days After (46), General (1)
5	2	a	For about a year now I've been experimenting heavily with mixing LSD and different types of meditation such as kundalini meditation and astral projection.
6	2	a	A friend got me a really good batch of liquid LSD and at around the same time I'd been using an audio entrainment called 'Meditation Mastery Activations' for Higher Self communication.
7	2	a	I was staying in a friend's cabin in the Californian redwoods and she was away at the time - perfect.  The acid was really smooth, I was sitting out in the sun looking at the trees and could see them breathing.  The trunks were pulsating in and out.  I could also clearly see the trunks radiating a bright green aura.  
8	2	a	Clearly things were kicking in nicely so I put on my headphones and started the Higher Self meditation.
9	2	a	Seconds, minutes, hours later?  I don't know.  I behind closed eyes I could just see white light getting stronger and stronger.  I began to hear a beautiful hum and I started getting visions as if I was traveling at light speed.
10	2	a	All of a sudden I felt myself burst into some kind of dimension.  Where all this light was coming from.  I was floating, flowing, soaking in it.  I could see inside my body and I saw it being filled with these streams of light.  Things would slow, then speed up amazingly fast and I couldn't keep up, but at all times it was ecstatic.
11	2	a	I had the strongest feeling that I was floating inside my Higher Self somehow.  I just knew.  I didn't need anything here and I didn't want for anything.  I must have been here for a few hours, because when I came out the sun had changed a fair bit in the sky.
12	2	a	It's taken me a lot of time to process this experience and there is so much I just can't put into words.    
13	2	a	This was one of the most profound experiences that I've ever had.

16	2	a	'Painting Realizations: 10 Things I Learned From My First Trip'
17	2	a	Before starting this report, Id like to explain who the people involved in my life that will be mentioned are. 
18	2	a	Ill refer to myself as Len. Im an international student who has recently moved to New York City to attend college. I dont want to disclose too much, but Ill tell you I used to live in Europe. Im currently studying Communications, though for some time I have wanted to switch to Music Business. I am not very happy with my living arrangement within the University - I live with 11 other girls in a loft, which is always dirty, as they dont clean up after themselves. I feel disconnected with them, and I am not too comfortable in that environment. 
19	2	a	I have shared this experience with two other girls, who have now become my Acid Sisters. The first is my closest friend here in New York, Summer. Summer and I have been friends for almost a year now, and we have a lot in common spiritually, which I was aware of even before the trip. The other girl is Dianna. Shes been friends with Summer, also for a significant amount of time, but before this experience we werent awfully close - nevertheless, I did like Dianna a lot. 
20	2	a	We were sober-sat by Louise (though she prefers sober-played-with), and her sort-of-boyfriend Frey, who I went to high school with. Louise is Diannas suite mate, who shares the apartment in the dorm with her, and she was there as we dropped in Diannas room. We were meant to originally do it in Summers room, but her roommate (who isnt too fond of psychedelic substances) was there, and Diannas place was bigger anyways. 
21	2	a	Another thing I should mention is that at one point in this story, Diannas current sort-of- boyfriend, Mark, stops by. I am not too fond of Mark for two reasons. First, the only time I hung out with him, Summer, and Dianna, during the previous week, he seemed somewhat pompous. He would recite textbook-like phrases, and Id stand there, high as a kite, watching as Dianna wrote it all down. It almost seemed like the Mark-cult, which I was definitely not eager to join. 
22	2	a	The second reason comes in handy, because it also provides some backstory for some of the things that I saw, and felt, during the trip. Earlier on the month, Id began a sexual relationship with this guy called Seth. I, stupidly enough, fell head over heels for him. I think everyone around me realized that he didnt care for me... except for me. Dont get me wrong, I had reasons to believe that wasnt the case, but I was somewhat blinded by other convictions as well. When we tripped, I hadnt seen Seth for about two weeks, and we were no longer involved, as he had ditched me accidentally one night, and I had decided Id had enough, so I deleted his number and texts from my phone. Summer had run into him, and he kept claiming he was going to reach out to me, but when I contacted him and was ignored, I decided to let it go and give up. It wasnt easy, and I kept blaming myself for it, seeing Seth as a special, wasted opportunity I had thrown away. I was simply unable to move on, or realize better would have come along eventually. Because both Mark and Seth were film students, they shared a lot of classes, which brought about a certain hostility between them. Mark despised Seth, and claimed he was extremely pretentious and aloof (which is true enough, but save the aloofness, also applicable to Mark himself). That very same night we hung out, he declared ferociously Fuck Seth! to which I amicably replied, Hah, been there, done that. He was visibly irked out, and said to me, Wow, Im sorry you have to live with yourself, after that. I didnt feel particularly insulted, but rather undermined and skeptical about this guys supposed caring, gentle, spirit. I just didnt see it. 
23	2	a	Now that everyone has been introduced, lets begin at the beginning.
24	2	a	This whole venture began about five months ago, when, before meeting in person, Summer and I decided we wanted to explore psychedelic endeavors - she proposed eventually taking shrooms and listening to Lou Reed (who is a somewhat mythical figure to me), which I was all in for.
25	2	a	We felt ready around the beginning of October, back when I met this kid called Dylan West - whom we all just called West. Id describe him as a fuckboy junkie extraordinaire; hes the kind of guy whos currently trying to grow pot in his dorm room, dabs indoors with the smoke detectors all over the place, trips almost on a bi-weekly basis, and has a penchant for smoking up with steamy showers in the bathrooms indoors. As soon as I decided Seth was a no-go, I had ended up Wests world. I slept over at his place for the entire weekend, two weeks before tripping, and we eventually hooked up at one point. I knew he was the right person to ask for a hookup. 
26	2	a	Predictably, New York City drugs are expensive. West recommended one gram for each of us as a threshold dose (both Summer and I are 52 and about 110 lbs., so it typically doesnt take a lot for us to be affected), but his dealers prices would have forced us to spend ti50 on it, which he said wasnt worth it. Earlier on the week, a friend of mine, Remy, had taken shrooms, and was only able to trip on 2g. This would have brought the total of our supposed expenses to $100, which I just could not spend on drugs (yet I have probably already spent it on cigarettes, go figure). West then recommended us just going with acid instead. I was reluctant, since I believed shrooms would have been a better initiation, as they were more natural, and I wasnt too eager to put such harsh chemicals through my body. West claimed it wasnt much of a difference, and that he had started with LSD anyways. That wasnt enough to convince me, since one of Wests go-to catch phrases waking up in the morning was I need to get fucked up before breakfast. Sobriety is overrated. I didnt wish to end up like that, so I checked in with Summer and she was okay with acid instead of shrooms. I was desperate to begin my career as a psychonaut, so I gave in at my best friends request. 
27	2	a	We met Wests dealer three days before tripping, and paid about ti45 for two tabs of, supposedly, pure-ass acid that we placed in a fire-engine-red Italian Sicilian Orange Tic Tac box. Turns out, it was a great container, as the red filtered out most light from the substance, and acid is best kept in a cool, dark environment. Summer and I had planned to trip on Saturday night, but we had decided to head to a frat party on Friday, where she didnt have a great experience, and needed one day to recover. 
28	2	a	On Sunday morning, I was very upset. My room in the dorm was so messed up from me attempting to re-organize it that my bed was entirely covered in plastic bags, so I decided to sleep on the couch of the common area. My roommate hadnt noticed me, and accidentally locked me out of our room, before leaving for her hometown for fall recess break. Because this wasnt the first time that this had happened, I flipped out. There was outright screaming on my part in my native language, and I am not ashamed to say I talked to myself as a means to release stress. I had to go downstairs with the previous nights makeup, my pajamas and no shoes, so I felt extremely embarrassed. To add to that, Summer called to let me know that Dianna was going to join us, and she had decided to split her tab with her. I felt abandoned by her, and unwilling to accept it, (I now understand that this is definitely none of my business to control and decide). 
29	2	a	I definitely think that that freakout was one of the best things that could have happened. Back when Summer confessed to me that she didnt want to trip on Saturday, she was particularly shaken, which brought me to have negative feelings regarding the Seth situation. Releasing all of my stress and anger put me in one of the best mental places for the trip, and I felt powerful and reinvigorated. I ran some errands throughout the day, and met Summer around 7 PM. We went to our respective homes, so that she could pick up the Tic Tac box, and change into more comfortable clothes. On our way back to Diannas, we saw Frey and Louise, and they told us they were going to swing by later, which I was happy and excited about. 
30	2	a	We briefly saw Mark outside of the building of Diannas dorm (Summer and I lived in the same complex - which I will refer to as Blue C - while Dianna lived in Square Hall), as he exited, and told him about our subsequent plans. He wished us well, and we walked in the building. 
31	2	a	As soon as we saw our trip location, I was positively satisfied. It was a dorm apartment, so it wasnt enormous, but definitely bigger than Summers. There was a small hall and a living room area with a round circular table and a couch, as well as a decent bathroom and average-size kitchen. Dianna also said we were welcome to go to her room whenever, since her roommate wasnt home, but we remained in the common area for the initial part of the night. One of the reasons why we had also decided to do it at Diannas was because she had prepared endless tubes of acrylic pigments and large poster-size paper for us to paint on. 
32	2	a	I read a list of precautions and possible acid-induced negative thoughts that we might have had, so we could prepare for the worst in case of bad trips. We all turned out to have had designated tasks: I was the well-read expert, Summer had to physically take care of the stuff, and Dianna was more concerned with preparing activities to keep ourselves occupied during the night. 
33	2	a	Summer placed four different pieces of blotter paper on the table. One of them was a small 100 microgram square, which was for me, and two were tinier half pieces. There was also a little extra bit that Dianna and Summer also split. All in all, Id say they had about 50 micrograms each as their ultimate dose. (One of the reasons I was initially opposed to them splitting the other blotter was because their doses would have been significantly lower than mine, which I thought would have put me on a whole different level of experience, and I didnt want to be alone. Luckily, this didnt turn out to be an issue for any factor, besides duration of our trips, but Ill get to that later.) 
34	2	a	We were all pretty unaccustomed to acid consumption, so we placed the blotters underneath our tongue and waited, as Id read was the most traditional and effective mean of consumption. This was about 8 PM. 
35	2	a	For a little bit we just chilled out and talked, then Frey and Louise came back with their takeout food. We chatted up with them for some twenty minutes, and I discussed music with Louise. I was very reassured, as she and I were passionate about similar artists and genres, and I immediately thought she was going to be a brilliant DJ for the night. Summer then suggested us grabbing dinner, since we hadnt had much food (we both dont eat a lot... Id been so upset I was mostly hunger-less the whole day, and had only had a couple of slices of bread and a Special K bar, along with my coffee, as breakfast). We briefly stopped by CVS, before the acid started to hit us, and I picked up some sushi, while she opted for veggie dumplings. 
36	2	a	We went back to Square Hall, at Diannas, to eat, and immediately after I was done, I felt my muscles tensing up. I had a specific tense spot between my shoulder blades, which had me lifting and narrowing them. I immediately announced to Summer I was tensing up, and she nodded saying she also started to feel physically different (she mentioned something about not being able to feel her left arm and leg tension). I dont remember Dianna being particularly affected by that point, but she decided to sit on the floor, and began painting. 
37	2	a	Summer mentioned the blotter not dissolving yet after about 30 minutes of having taken it (she ate afterwords) and Louise recommended switching location to the rooftop of the mouth - this is possibly something to keep in mind for the next trip, as it immediately dissolved afterwards. I had accidentally swallowed my blotter earlier, which was probably one the reasons, along with the larger dose, why my trip was somewhat delayed when compared to theirs. Dianna was a true trooper, who kept the blotter underneath her tongue until it dissolved - and it took a long time: about an hour, but she began coming up immediately after it was absorbed. 
38	2	a	I had previously recommended us performing an activity while waiting to come up, as Id read it was much better to casually notice we were tripping, rather than waiting for tell-tale signs. I joined Dianna on the floor, and began to stroke swirls in an abstract manner (regardless of my background as an art student, Im not much of a painter.) 
39	2	a	About an hour after we dropped, I began to feel different. The muscle tension increased, and as I was prompted to look at my hand, I realized it felt disconnected from my body. It wasnt like a phantom limb, where I didnt feel it - it just felt foreign and far. As soon as I looked up at my surroundings, I realized everything felt slightly foreign and far. The circumstances were weird, and I asked myself what was so peculiar about the reality I was in. This feels weird, I said. Louise looked up at me with a concerned look, and asked, Bad weird?. I considered, and had a hard time deciding: my feelings, thoughts, and emotions, were getting hazier and confused, Not really... not bad and not good, just weird. This sense of weirdness persisted throughout the whole trip and well-into the next day. I considered, and had a hard time deciding: my feelings, thoughts, and emotions, were getting hazier and confused, Not really... not bad and not good, just weird. This sense of weirdness persisted throughout the whole trip and well-into the next day. I later realized it was this weirdness that caused me to dissociate from my immediate reality, and re-evaluate the world around me. 
40	2	a	My painting style was then forced to become different, as my movements became more erratic as a result of the growing muscular tension, and I decided to instinctively pick up colors, and just throw them around on the paper. Instead of swirls, I began to shade, mix, and create shapes of various sizes and forms. I disrupted the harmonious green-teal-gold scheme I was working with, to add traces of red, peach, yellow, and navy. I felt euphoric and inspired, as if Id just had two pops of Adderall or Ritalin (I sometimes take ADD prescription meds - despite not having ADD - as a way to concentrate on studying, and stay up all night). Dianna began talking, and I found everything she had to say extremely funny. Her, Summer, and I were laughing loudly at the most random comments made by each other, Louise, or Frey. 
41	2	a	Louises roommate, whose name I forget, was at the apartment too, and prepared brownies. I wasnt particularly hungry after the sushi, but decided to try one, as they looked very good. Unfortunately, I think she baked them with the wrong ingredients, since they tasted like garlic. The smell was so strong, I didnt even want to be next to the batch. Neither Louise, Frey, or herself seemed to notice any of this, or chose not to say anything, like Dianna. Summer and I both agreed they were really bad. 
42	2	a	The sense of weirdness slowly pervaded everything around me, and it evolved into an inability of my brain to properly process, and make sense of, my surroundings. It wasnt like I didnt understand anything anymore, but more like my immediate reality just didnt compute. Why was I there out of all places? Why was Frey, whom I went to school with, there? Why were he and Louise involved now? That was all so random. I couldnt justify any of it, and was very bothered by the fact. 
43	2	a	Acid attention-span is notoriously limited, so I shook my worrisome thoughts away, in favor of a deep desire to leave the room. Dianna and Summer followed me, as we headed to the floors hallway to look at the traffic and cars through the window. That was the only part of the trip where I felt extremely energetic, and I had a deep desire to release this energy by running around. Dianna, Summer and I ran around the stairs, laughingly numbed down. All across the stairway, there were signs up, which depicted an apple and a cigarette with a red cross over it. Summer remarked that it was the most messed up no-smoking sign shed ever seen, and I explained that the apple represented New York City, the Big Apple, so it did make sense. I realized that if I concentrated, and really looked at something, I could make sense of it, so I got very excited. We were about to run further down, when Louise came back to get us, and lead us back into the apartment. 
44	2	a	When Dianna, Summer, Louise, and I went back to the apartment, the weirdness continued. Sitting back down was difficult; I felt so hyperactive, but I let my movements guide me on the canvas, continuing my shading. Immediately, when I looked over at her, I noticed Dianna wasnt as keen on keeping herself as grounded, and she began to giggle all over the place again. I cant really remember how much time had passed while we were like that, but before I knew it, I noticed Dianna asking Louise to paint her feet.
45	2	a	Louise picked up a clean, fine brush, dipped in purple paint, and began drawing steady swirls all over Diannas feet, who felt giddy and excited. She laughed and waved her long arms in the air, as she announced how liberating it felt. Suddenly, Dianna was so into the whole painting experience, I noticed her taking off her t-shirt, revealing a sports bra. I asked her whether she felt cold, but she was way too exhilarated to answer, or care, probably. She began painting her own tummy in a dark teal color, and at every stroke, she felt more enthusiastic and free. It was beautiful for me to watch that, and I felt like I was seeing all of Dianna expressing her artistic nature - (Dianna is currently studying screenwriting, but in her spare time she sings, acts, and plays the trumpet. She defines herself as a full-fledged artist.) 
46	2	a	This is what I was meant to do! she continued to exclaim, this is just what I needed! Im releasing all of my artistic energy, and this is wonderful. It feels so right!. Upon seeing her so relieved, about something as, supposedly, trivial, as splashing paint on her bare tummy, I felt envious of Dianna for a split second. She was like a little kid, rediscovering the joy of colors all over again, and I wished I could feel like that about paint too. I wanted to find something to also feel liberated and lightheaded. All of a sudden, Summer, who had been sitting in a corner, blasting out some dank tunes, got up and demanded Dianna to paint her calves. Dianna picked up the navy brush Id been using, and began drawing patterns on Summers calve. 
47	2	a	Now, I really dont remember how what happened next initially developed, but I suppose it spawned out of a conversation I wasnt paying attention to. I was extremely concentrated in identifying how I felt, and settling down the weirdness. I think I spent a significant amount of time staring at Frey and Louise, who were also playing a drawing game (they were attempting to construct a character, by each drawing a head, torso, and legs in turn, and then comparing the result). I was really trying to spot the little things that made me think of them as a couple: sneaky kisses, graceful grazes, and just overall looks. I found it fascinating. 
48	2	a	But back to what I missed, as soon as I turned around, I noticed Dianna had written Fuck Misogyny on Summers tiny calve. I laughed very loudly, which prompted them to laugh more with me. Dianna then realized she wanted more paint!, and went to change into shorts. I started to feel a sense of extreme euphoria: I wanted to laugh, I wanted to paint, and I wanted to feel everyone around me on a deeper level. It was a strange sensation - something I thought as more akin to MDMA (which I havent tried, but am intending to soon).
49	2	a	Dianna raced back in a pair of short shorts, and I still wondered how she wasnt freezing, since we were all wearing hoodies but her. She looked down at me, and asked, with a huge grin on her face, Len, write Fuck Misogyny on my thighs! In red! I want it to look ginormous and aggressive!. I found the request hilarious, and agreed immediately. My muscles were still tense, and I felt strangely antsy (similar to the Ritalin-antsy I feel when I cruise), so the result wasnt the best. Not to mention, I accidentally misspelled Misogyny and had attempted to correct it, making the letters even more daunting and bolder-looking. Dianna was, nonetheless, very pleased with the result, as it wrapped around her back, and she had the last syllable visible only from behind. It was at that point that she said, You need some color in you! and sprinkled my hair and forehead in lavender. 
50	2	a	Something you must know about me, I am extremely paranoid about my hair. I need to constantly straighten it every time I wash it (its naturally frizzy/wavy), and Id just done that for the occasion, earlier on the day. Having paint in my hair would have made it crusty and dirty, so as soon as I saw it there, I exclaimed, Dianna! Not my hair!, still laughing, of course. She conceded, but didnt let go of my face, Okay, but you still need some more color. At that point, Summer came up from behind, and began painting the back of Diannas legs, who then sneaked up on me, and stroked a huge red line on my face. I hadnt even realized it, but a painting battle was ensuing. Dianna was so into it, she began painting both herself and us, by squeezing the tubes directly on our skin. She recommended Summer and I both change in shorts and sports bras, so we could all paint each other. 
51	2	a	I am not the kind of person who typically agrees to this kind of stuff. I am not entirely comfortable with getting down and dirty, but I thought to myself, Im on acid, might as well! and as soon as I had mentally accepted the fact I was going to get painted all over, I felt extremely ecstatic. I wouldnt say my emotional responses were slowed down or delayed, but rather amplified: I processed everything with intensity, and was determined to survey my stance on every event that took place. Obviously, because of the confusion and haze of weirdness, I didnt reach very promising conclusions. It was very basic business - either something made me very happy, or very confused. 
52	2	a	When I went to Diannas room to change, I realized I didnt even care about being nude with the door open. I have always been very confident and at ease with being naked, but it was always with people I knew. In this case, in order to put Diannas clothes on, I needed to go full topless for some seconds, and Frey was right there in the living room, which was directly adjacent. I found myself so contented in my own skin that I wouldnt have minded being full-on naked and dancing. Still, I did realize that it wasnt an option, because of our hosts. 
53	2	a	This is something worth mentioning: when I was on acid, I was perfectly able to put myself in the shoes of a sober person. I could immediately imagine how Louise and Frey, and even Louises roommate, must have felt seeing that weird spectacle, and I initially apologized for it. Thankfully, Louise happens to be incredibly awesome, so she simply smiled at me and said, Len, youre on LSD, its bound to get weird. Stop apologizing. 
54	2	a	Our acid-uniform was extremely revealing, but it was absolutely perfect for the incredible amounts of paint we were about to pour on each other. I was wearing brown lipstick, and immediately realized it couldnt stay on. I needed to be fully naked, fully raw, so I quickly went to the bathroom to remove it. It was laborious, but entertaining; I tried to use tissues and water, but it smeared a red stain all over my chin - which only made me laugh more. Most people say mirrors arent a good idea on acid, but I have to disagree. I loved looking at myself so happy and carefree. 
55	2	a	Eventually, I realized that Dianna actually had makeup-remover wipes, and attempted to use them to remove the red smear on my face. I was somewhat successful, but at one point I remembered I was about to get paint all over it anyways, so I just left and ran back out. The sight I was greeted with was peculiar, to say the least: both Summer and Dianna were dipping their hands in paint, and plastering each other with it. I immediately joined, with black and gold 
56	2	a	palms, but as more paint accidentally got in my long, blonde hair, I felt even more uneasy. Louise, who was watching from a distance, offered to put my hair up in a top knot, and I thanked her endlessly. I remember thinking that she was being like a little guardian angel for us. 
57	2	a	And, like that, we drifted into another dimension. We painted our cheeks, our bellies, our chests, our legs, our arms... and it was beautiful. I wouldnt say that for me and Summer it was as liberating as it must have been for Dianna, who is much more connected to painting than us. Yet, it was something filled with beauty. We were in a daze of colors and easygoing uneasiness - it was weird, but it was okay! Thats when the perception of time went out of the window. I frankly dont remember for how long we painted each other for, but it was like a sacred ritual, so it was worthy of being timeless. 
58	2	a	At that point, an RA knocked on our door. It was Sunday night, and starting 11 PM, all halls of our university force us to turn music and voices down for quiet hours. I hadnt factored time in, so I immediately jumped to the conclusion that this person clearly knew we were on LSD, so I ran to Diannas room. She saw me and smiled anxiously, Len, you cant hide! This doesnt even look suspicious... they cant know! What would they write us up for? Being fucking weirdos covered in paint? Isnt that what college is all about?. For someone on acid, that was series of very logical arguments. 
59	2	a	Sadly, I couldnt be as logical as Dianna, so I still felt worried. Louise answered the door, and, like we suspected, the RA only wanted us to turn the volume down a bit, to which she agreed, and he, supposedly, left. I dont think he paid attention to, or saw, the three of us. I stumbled upon the mirror as I walked back to the living room, for what I thought was going to be round two of paint, and everything changed. 
60	2	a	As soon as I saw myself, I was shell-shocked. My face striped in red and gold, my legs scribbled in teal and navy, and my tummy yellow and purple - I felt so feral, so animalistic, so wild. I felt like a ferocious version of me. Summer and Dianna turned around to tell me how beautiful I looked, which only fueled this sensation more. Summers face was half-black and half-teal, and she also seemed real and majestic... and Dianna? Diannas face was green! She looked like mother nature! I felt connected to the two of them on a deeper level, like we were a tribe of painted Indians (Im pretty sure that if Id taken two tabs - like we plan to do soon - and felt a more intense high, I would have started to do some powwow dance shit. Summer had been dancing all night already, as she has had dancing training background, and was so in-tune with the harmonies that played, I loved watching her). 
61	2	a	We had never looked so beautiful, to me, but the more I scrutinized my appearance, the more I came to the realization that the paint had to come off. I looked at Diannas tummy, the first body part we had painted, and noticed the previously moist pigment had now solidified, and seemed fibrous and hardened, like it was about to crack at any minute. The paint was now a fraud - a courageous cover hiding my true self, and I had to let go of it immediately. My soul had to be completely naked for the trip, and this paint was covering it! Sure it had been fun, but like all things it had to end. 
62	2	a	As I began to scrape the hardened paint off of my chest, I realized what I just thought. I realized how immersed into my own thought process I was, and I slowed down. I rubbed my skin slowly and, frankly, it became even a little painful after a while (when I looked at the mirror, the peeled parts were all visibly sensitive-looking and reddened). It didnt matter though, because I was letting go of what covered me to reveal my true self and begin my trip - and there was no better come up. Feeling my flesh through my flesh was almost like a paradoxical surreal experience: my sense of touch was confused as to which surface was actually part of my own body, and which simply encrusted it. I gave myself warmth and protection; I suddenly felt very warm and cozy inside. 
63	2	a	The more I embraced myself by rubbing it all away, the more these thoughts seemed to have appeared. I thought about feeling at one with me - about wanting to keep hugging and touching myself; about nourishment. In particular, the nourishment of my soul, and how much feeding it must have been doing through my endless turbine of volatile, airy emotions. 
64	2	a	At this point, Id crossed the event horizon. The thoughts about spirituality, and communion with the self, clouded up my mind at every dazzling fingertip motion I made on my surface skin. This is the moment where I truly realized I was very high. My trip had actually commenced, and there was no going back now! 
65	2	a	On an important note: I wasnt impeded. I feel like movies, television, songs, or even just peoples verbal or visual descriptions and portrayals of being high on LSD are very much different from what you end up feeling, at least from what I ended up feeling on my dose. I wasnt totally fucked up!, like I could have never stepped out of it. In fact, Im sure that if I had been given some sort of fairly easy task, I would have been able to complete it (obviously nothing that required lots of creativity, as letting the mind run wild is what ultimately tripping is all about, and would definitely stimulate it.) Basically, I could have kept my cool, no problem there. 
66	2	a	The problems seemed to arise when I let myself zone out: my intellect drifting in and out of reality, and its metaphysical formations. Whenever I retreated into my own little world, I saw what was around me as a fraud - as a metaphysical landscape which, despite striving fearlessly, was definitely not the actual truth that I was exposed to on a daily basis. I was stuck in this dream-like haze, absorbing everything else around me, and soaking it in my melted brains acid- juice. Still, Id like to stress how much mentally hampered I wasnt. I was on drugs, sure, but when drunk, or stoned, Im usually less likely to be at a complete cognitive loss. I mean, nothing goes on, as far as brain functions go, when Im on those substances. Acid was much more like there was too much going on. 
67	2	a	Speaking of, everything was too much. This particular state caused me a lot of what is commonly known as distress. Im saying commonly known because the word closest to describing how reality affected me at that point was distress - yet it holds a really negative connotation. I want to highlight the fact that the distress I was feeling wasnt entirely negative, oh no. This goes for anything else that might follow in the report: even if it seems like Im describing negative emotions, they most definitely werent. Most of my trip was tainted by euphoria, wonder, and confusion - but overall, it was a very neutral experience, which made it much more complex, and interesting. 
68	2	a	So, back to the distress. I believe it was caused by the fact that everything around me was too much to handle. I looked over at every single random object around, and it amazed me. It wasnt like it seemed new, or I was seeing it through new eyes - no; I knew exactly what everything was, but I couldnt register it. I couldnt compute or understand it. Everything seemed to have a point, and objects just didnt. They just lied there, and the fact that they did was baffling me. It was funny, and, as always, confusing, at the same time. Everything sparked a whole new trail of thoughts and observations, so when I was forced to just look at things, I couldnt. I had to sit back, and actually observe them, considering them in the most holistic way possible. 
69	2	a	This, in turn, prompted me to think of acid as a little lens that zoomed into my feelings regarding everything. The intensity of emotions I felt was incredibly amplified, and I mean, I dont consider myself as particularly apathetic on a daily basis, but Im not very in tune with what I feel either. As I kept peeling scrapes of paint off of my belly, I was trying to identify how I felt - but I felt so much. At the same time. And I couldnt break it apart, no matter how much I tried, all I could do was just sit there and feel it, soaking it all in, like a little sponge. 
70	2	a	Dianna and Summer, who were definitely more socially engaged with each other by that point, just kept peeling, until one of them (I honestly cannot remember who it was) suggested to hop in the shower. Dianna thought it was a magnificent idea and, with a cheshire-cat worthy grin, sprinted to the bathroom to get the water running. Summer followed her with excitement, but I wasnt as joyful, all of a sudden. The feeling of weirdness from before had settled in with extreme intensity, and my inability to process my immediate surroundings sent me mentally far back to civilization. I thought about the concept of a shower - and how that involves getting hair wet. 
71	2	a	My hair was still in that top knot Louise had solidly pinned up in place an hour before, (I actually have no idea how much time had passed. Dianna had devised a system where she would give Mark a call every hour, in order to keep track of time, but had given it up after the first two calls, as we had decided to succumb to acid and lose ourselves in its timeless dimension), but it wasnt going to save much from the furious dorm-room nozzle sprinkling Diannas bathtub was equipped with. In the real world we could have found a way for me not to get my hair wet, but thinking systematically about real-life practical solutions seemed like a removed concept. No, I knew that if I stepped in that tub, my glorious straightened locks would have turned into the unruly lions mane I was born with. 
72	2	a	It probably seems a little weird to you that Im making such a big deal out of... well, hair. But it defined me. It still does. My hair is one of my favorite things about me, and I love to have control over how it looks, styling it to my liking. Getting it wet made me fearful and anxious, but I felt even more fearful and anxious, as soon as I realized my friends had left me in the living room. Im sure Louise and Frey were caught up in their own little romantic game to mind my uneasiness, but I still decided to join Summer and Dianna in the bathroom, instead. 
73	2	a	I saw them immediately hop in the tub, and turn, the shower on. Dianna took off her bra, and did her arm-wave thing again, her eyes squint-shut and her mouth wide open, soaking in the warm liquid droplets all around. Summer kept her top on for a little while, as she tried to only wash the paint off of her feet, but Dianna pushed her right below the water. She looked peaceful and exhilarated, letting out a loud, genuine laugh. It was so nice to see the two of them so happy. It warmed me up inside, when the rest of what was around me seemed cold and meaningless. 
74	2	a	They were somewhere else, but I wasnt with them. I was caught up in figuring out a way to get the paint off of my body without getting my hair wet. I sat by the tub, in front of the sink, with knees up to my nose. I found that I still couldnt help but touch myself, I needed to feel my body there, with my mind. I was afraid that if I didnt, everything would have disconnected. I stared at my legs a lot, but I wasnt exactly tripping; I mean, by that point I still hadnt felt extremely visually engaged by the trip. It seemed a little like weed, the colors looked nicer and brighter, but I hadnt seen. 
75	2	a	I wasnt thinking about that at the present moment, I wasnt thinking about anything in particular. Dianna and Summer pulled the shower curtains over, so that the water wouldnt have gotten me wet, and that prompted me to shut the door of the bathroom. I stretched my legs and decided to look at what was ahead of me, for a second. Oh man, was it complex. The little tiles squared off every single centimeter of that wall, compressing the whole white thing in small little grids. And the more I heard Dianna and Summer laughing, the more the tiles seemed to reflect that - they were the manifestation of those timid little shrills and squeaks that occasionally escaped from their vocal chords. And thats when I saw. 
76	2	a	I looked down at the mirror, and then at the sink. I was particularly fascinated by the the lower part, as Id never previously even paid a single mind to it. I wasnt looking at the pipes either, it was just the lower part of the sink container, as I saw it from ground level, that astounded me. I noticed it was white porcelain, and that it had tiny holes at the side. I kept staring at them in amazement, those holes were beautiful: small, delicate, circular, and harmonious with the rest of the design. The beauty ended quite rapidly though, as the smallest of the holes began to slowly expand, and then diminish in size again. Yeah, the sink was definitely breathing. 
77	2	a	I edged closer to stare at that spectacle, and watched carefully, as the hole, which, by that point, had definitely become the sinks mouth, opened and closed ever-so-steadily. But it wasnt a calm inhale and exhale... it was gradual, but by no means relaxed. It was frantic, lonely, and bleak. I heard Summer calling my name, wondering why I hadnt jumped in, but Dianna quickly explained to her that I was gone into my world. Then again, I totally understood everything, I did hear them - I just chose not to care; the sink seemed like a such a bigger deal at the moment.
78	2	a	And thats when I had my first realization, as I stroked the cold porcelain, I felt out of breath myself. Its the loH, I thought. That loH is making me suffocate; this sink is just as much me as I am breathless, and it. I kept studying the respiratory patterns of the sink, and noticed it slowing down even more, to the point of stopping. As soon as that happened, I opened up the shower curtains, and with what I assume was a terribly bewildered look on my face, I announced, I need to move out of that loft. 
79	2	a	Summer smiled open wide (because of a previous incident, which is definitely a story for some other time, Summer really wasnt fond of my loft mates, and had always been favorable to the idea of me looking for somewhere else to live in), and her eyes lit up even more, Come on in! she encouraged me, nodding off to the tub. 
80	2	a	After having suddenly realized that it was the loft that had made me feel toxic all along (not talking about the trip here, just my state of mind during the day), I felt the sudden need to be clean. To wash it all away, and screw my hair! Yet, I wasnt fully convinced.
81	2	a	But, my hair! I complained, It looks disgusting in its natural waves. 
82	2	a	Dianna grinned, I have a straightener, she said, Itll be fun. Come get clean, Len! And like that, as she spritzed water onto Summer, who sat there and took it all in with her eyes closed, I realized I had to do that: I had to get clean. I took my top off, stepped into the tub and felt the water on my skin, so warm and comforting. As I rapidly undid Louises top-knot, I felt even more liberated, Girls, this is my cleanse, I announced boldly. 
83	2	a	Once I sat there, there were few more moments where I embraced and rubbed my flesh. I dont know whether it was because I felt vaguely cold, or because I wanted to get all traces of paint out, or just because I wanted to keep experiencing the touch of my own skin, but it was effective for all three of those reasons. I cannot tell how much time I spent in my own little tub cocoon: it could have been seconds, minutes, hours, or even days. I remember, at one point, commenting on how it even felt like weeks. 
84	2	a	Sitting there wasnt as euphorically entrancing as it looked, by the way. As soon as I settled, I just thought... again. I loved to fall into pensiveness, but the more I came up, the more thoughts I had. I couldnt really concentrate on one single thing; everything induced me to question it. I was so removed from the reality around me that everything was overwhelming, and arising simultaneously. But instead of staying separate and going nowhere, it was like all of those questions united into one big reflection - and, after reaching such a promising conclusion on my living situation, I began evaluating other aspects of my life. All of it, all at once. 
85	2	a	As my mind grew heavy, I noticed that Dianna was right, and I was in my own little world. I couldnt be social at that moment; I mean, its not exactly like I couldnt, more like I really, really, didnt want to. Not through words at least. 
86	2	a	I evacuated my mind to look at my fellow trip members, and they seemed to be just as engaged as me. Dianna sat at the end of the tub, lying with her arms spread out on its edge, while Summer had her legs crossed to my right. The more I watched them, the more I felt like I wanted to be in their heads. I wanted to feel what they were feeling, but I couldnt bring myself to say it, so I chose actions to portray my words. 
87	2	a	I reached out to them, and embraced their shoulders. They moved closer to me, and we stood there like that for another timeless while. I gripped their wet arms and bodies in shower-soaked glory; feeling their entities in there, in the same position, in the same place - both mentally and physically - was wondrous. We were naked, in every sense of the word. We were all experiencing so much, and the more we touched each other, the more we felt it all around us: our adventures slowly merging together, in one moment of shared acid communion. It was magnificent. 
88	2	a	Thats when we realized that there was no going back, that after this experience, we would have been bonded for life. It wasnt just about dropping, and experimenting, with friends anymore. It was about acquiring a new, elevated connection, with each other. I loved them; probably more than I loved my thoughts - and they became my thoughts, as the force of their love and attachment overcame me. I loved love, and I loved to love. So much love. 
89	2	a	Summer, then, decided to head out. I asked her, Arent you finding this paradise?, to which she just looked at me and remarked, I was like that two hours ago! with a big smile on her face. She thought she wasnt affected by the substance anymore, but I didnt believe her. I let her go, since I figured she probably wanted to be alone for a bit. Dianna and I both agreed that we needed to be warmed up a little more before leaving. 
90	2	a	Dianna leaned her head back on the edge of the tub, and we both retreated back into our own respective dimensions. I was still in a haze of confused emotions, running one after the other, and often together - but all were tinged by love now. I thought about people that had left my life back when I moved here (before leaving, a bit of a mess happened with my old friends in my so-called hometown, and I had been alienated from my social circle) and then, it hit me that I still loved them. But not in a way that was holding me back, in a way whereby I thought of the good times we had had, how much they made me grow, and how thankful I was for all those experiences. I realized life was a constant running course, but that the feelings associated with particular moments would always be there, and I could choose to bring those back, as opposed to the hostility that subsequently overcame our relationships. That didnt matter, because it was a negative emotion, and I loved too much to feel it. 
91	2	a	My sea of feelings was briefly softened by Dianna, whom I realized I was lying on top of, only when she put her head up again, and attempted to explain, Oh I was on such a good trip Len... I was on a spaceship... but then I became the ship... and I was flying, oh it was beautiful! and I could see it. And it was. Picturesque. But I couldnt talk about that now, no matter how much I wanted to be visually engaged, I just needed to share emotions. 
92	2	a	I feel so much love right now, I communicated casually. My tone seemed almost sleepy and uninterested, but I figured I was simply physically consumed, and mentally overwhelmed, by the experience. Dont you?! Dianna asked excitedly; she seemed to definitely relate, as her eyes lit up. Theres so much love in this apartment now, I couldnt be any happier! she exclaimed. I simply smiled. Smiling was weird, tense, but so natural. I remember back when we were painting, I couldnt help but smile - like I had to tense up my muscles, and do it. But as I grew more pensive, I felt a decided separation from the come-up to the actual trip. The come-up was happiness, the trip was love. I separated them, deciding that, while happiness was beautiful, this was so much more engaging. Experiencing that much love didnt make me want to smile. No, it just made me more of a sponge, and I just kept absorbing it all around me. 
93	2	a	And the fact that theres so much art in here! Dianna added, I just, I just think this is what Im meant to be doing, you know? Like all of this art is my calling... all of this art and love. I would have spoken, but articulating a response took too much effort. (Honestly, I probably did, I just cannot remember what I said... I cannot remember how this particular conversation went, sadly, so Im probably paraphrasing what exactly was said. I remember that I just kept going on and on about feelings, while Dianna expanded upon her affinities with art). 
94	2	a	Youre such an artist though, like, you actually are! valley-girl speak was what was most articulate of me. I thought in very complex terms, but I was only able to express them in condensed form. If I attempted to exposed my theories, as I thought them out, I would have not made any sense whatsoever... but more about that later. 
95	2	a	Dianna smiled, So are you, she said. And it was true: we were all artists, because we were all lovers. We were one and the same. Everyone. It was such a universal discernment, that I was sure, no, I knew, that she just had had the same thought. Diannas blue eyes immediately widened, her smile grew wider, and with a startled look on her face, she declared, Oh Len, I just realized something, listen to this! 
96	2	a	I knew that was cue for me to turn around and sit directly in front of her. She spoke animatedly, and eloquently elucidated to me my second realization: 
97	2	a	Love is art, Len. Love is the abstraction of everything behind art. 
98	2	a	That made sense! I chimed in, Yes because we communicate what we hold dear to us, what were passionate about! 
99	2	a	She nodded, Yes, exactly! And art is just the tangible expression of love. The physical in what connects us and makes us feel. And its just so powerful, you know? 
100	2	a	This may sound like gibberish to you now, but it still makes perfect sense to me. To put it more fluently: art is a tangible manifestation of what arouses feeling in us, and regardless of what those feelings are, love is usually involved, as we create work based on things that we actually care about; while love is the conceptualized notion of all thats behind artistic creation. See, it is an intelligible theory. 
101	2	a	Immediately after reaching that enlightening conclusion, Dianna felt at a good mental place and got out of the shower. I knew I needed to stay for longer, alone, and trip a little bit. I thought that acid was going to transport me places randomly, but I had complete control on the level of immersion I wanted to experiment with, and now it was the time to dive. I leaned back and assumed Diannas old placement, but probably didnt look as majestic (my arms and legs are about half her lengths!) 
102	2	a	But instead of being richly involved into another world, I remained in the dimension of feelings Id been previously exploring, until i closed my eyes. Closing my eyes was interesting. Id say I wasnt Tripping hard!!!1111,, but I definitely had compelling closed-eye visuals. It was mostly mandalas, and typical LSD-esque tubular designs, moving around in teal, golden orange, and this iridescent purple/magenta color. All the shades were extremely vivid, but the shape of what I was looking at exactly seemed unclear. It was all relatively dark, and I had to dig deep to let it fully overtake me. All in all, I thought that I hadnt taken enough of Lucys juice to be actually optically enthralled, but boy was I wrong. 
103	2	a	I decided Id had enough of looking for an outer body experience, to then end up finding spiral patterns. I felt weirdly jealous of Dianna, and how, even with just half a blotter, she was able to feel and envision so much more than me. Maybe a change of scenery would have helped, I considered, so, with the little dexterity I had left, I turned off the shower and got up, determined to go out...only to realize my clothes werent there. 
104	2	a	Dianna! I called out. I heard her laughing, Yes? I think I left my clothes in your room... can I borrow some PJs, or something? I asked. I sounded very normal, which was strange. Was my trip already over? 
105	2	a	Sure, one minute!, I heard her exclaim from afar. She sounded so far, all the way in another room. Another room was another dimension... and I kept feeling bizarre: I wasnt high anymore, I told myself. Yet, the feeling of peculiarity and weirdness was still there. The whole reality around me was uneasy, and standing there in the cold, topless and in soaked shorts, didnt make things any un-uneasier. I decided to act sober, so that the trip would have further diminished, despite it had seemingly died out already. 
106	2	a	Again, time was confusing, so I dont know how much of it passed, but I stood there, like that, for a significant amount. I remember thinking how Dianna was taking forever, and I wanted to have some clothes on my body already! Dianna, can I borrow a towel, at least? I finally asked. 
107	2	a	Oh RIGHT. Im so sorry Len, this has all ben so confusing! I heard her, afar again. 
108	2	a	Her steps edged closer, with a tense kind of grace. She seemed to float amidst gravity, her euphoria lifting her up, as she opened the door. 
109	2	a	Here, she handed me a large white t-shirt, you know one of those they hand you somewhere youve actually been to, along with a pair of checkered pink and black bottoms. They were a little large on my small frame, but it was comfortable. Actually, it felt amazing. Like every inch of the fabric was cuddling my body. A pajama acid hug. The whole thing was so pleasing that I didnt even mind my wet, long hair looking especially brown and curly in its state. Id stood there so long it wasnt even dripping anymore, just a little damp. Not to mention, my underwear had gotten soaked with Diannas shorts, from before (we never took our bottoms off, in the shower) and so I was having my first, and painfully necessary, college-commando experience. Even letting my lady parts breathe helped me calm down. 
110	2	a	When I realized I was done dressing up, and had to head to Diannas room, I committed myself to keep what ended up being my sober-façade up. I can be completely unaffected by all of this, if I choose to, I reminded myself. So, one step after the other...- this is so weird.
111	2	a	As soon as I opened up the door, and saw Louise sitting there with Frey still, I knew this wasnt over. It was too weird to be over. Too unusual. Too peculiar. My steps were fragmented, and tentative, and everything seemed suddenly extremely uninviting. The kitchen didnt look like a kitchen, the common room didnt look like the common room wed been hanging out in, and Diannas room was another dimension. The dimension where my sisters and I had to step and be together in, immediately, I thought. I needed someone that could relate to what I was experiencing as soon as possible.
112	2	a	I walked in, to Summers velvety voice greeting me with gusto, Len, wazzup! I felt myself frowning, despite not wanting to, This is so weird, was all I could say. Summer grinned, her blue eyes trying to perceive exactly what my state of minds valence was: good or bad weird? As if Id just read her mind, I added, Good weird, but still weird. She nodded, and returned to whatever it was she had been doing on Diannas bed. 
113	2	a	I think I should mention there were two beds on the room, positioned parallel to each other, with a vast walking space in the middle. I sat on the left side, on Diannas roommates bed (whose name I forget, as she wasnt there that night), while Summer had been chilling on Diannas mattress, which was so messy that I think part of it might have been exposed. Still, not any messier than my mattress. 
114	2	a	Maybe its the SSRIs, you know? I read some people cant really trip on those, Dianna said, as she restlessly walked around the room. She kept stepping back and forth, while scratching and caressing her body. I was past that phase, but I still stroked my cheeks and chin way too much for my own good. 
115	2	a	Yeah, I dont know. Its not like Im not feeling it, just not really anything too intense. Im not affected by it. Summer said. I connected the dots, and realized that Summer had probably lamented not being high, while I was still in the shower. I related to that, since it was just what Id been thinking of, but things were about to change. Plus, quite frankly, Summer has a high tolerance when it comes to substances, albeit being even a couple of pounds less than me, and roughly the same height. I knew my girl, and I knew that merely half a blotter wasnt going to, necessarily, be life-altering for her. 
116	2	a	Me, on the other hand... I was a different story that was about to turn to its climaxing page. I am known to be moody, and it isnt unusual for my state of mind to shift rapidly from hour to hour, depending on the circumstances. Acid really didnt help with that. Its little lens zoomed in that shift, and before I could even process what my name was, I was back in the feels-dimension. 
117	2	a	I felt everything. Everything that was inside that relatively small dorm room was transmitting some sort of energy that I absorbed in subtle, but extremely potent ways. Every single entity in the room, be it Summer or Dianna, a sweater on the floor, a sham-less pillow on the bed, or a picture of an asian little girl, was feeling with me everything. No, I guess a more accurate description would be that every single entity contributed to characterizing the rooms feel, and that feel in turn affected me, as the setting was pivotal to the experience. I was the room, or better, I was what I felt like in the room. 
118	2	a	I looked around me, and the weirdest part was that all of these feelings came about on a purely superficial level. It wasnt like I had immersed myself in the details surrounding many of the times thrown all over the place. Just by looking, just by simply noticing one, tiny little thing, the whole feel became different. It became richer, it expanded and grew inside me, until I couldnt process it anymore.
119	2	a	I chose to focus on illustrations and decorations, since they were mere replicas of reality, and everything seemed like an unauthentic copy at the moment. Dianna had decorated her side of the cream-colored wall with a series of Keith Haring-themed designs, but one of them particularly stood out to me: it was a blue faceless stickman (his typical shapes) standing on a huge marine-mammal looking yellow creature. Its eyes were widened, just like its mouth, and it seemed like it was suffering from the weight, or perhaps the supposed motion, of the person on top of it. It made me very pensive. 
120	2	a	At first, it sparked within me very literal thoughts. I imagined humans, and how terrible our relationship with animals really is, despite how much we pride ourselves in being the protectors of the sea, which made my vibe drop significantly. I thought about a particular instance in Sixth Grade, when one of our Middle School Orientation teachers had forced all of the grade in the our auditorium to view a then-recent video of seal violence in the arctic. I remember how disgusted and appalled I felt, but that only translated into resignation - not even sadness, just a desolate feeling as I decided that it was in human nature to be cruel, and not every animal could be free. 
121	2	a	It was in human nature to be cruel. Like Seth. Seth had been cruel to me. And he always popped up. I dont know why I had some sort of notion that I was over him, or that drugs would have made me over him, because despite the deeply-felt heart-to-heart Id had with Summer the previous day, he was still there! Still monopolizing and dictating me and making me wonder, what had I done wrong? Why had I lost him. Why didnt I see him anymore. Wait. I was the one not seeing him anymore, not the other way around! 
122	2	a	As I still stared at the blue stickman, I realized I was it. I was the stickman and Seth was the little seal, because I had always been on top of him (technically, in more ways than one, but Im trying to be serious here, so Im keeping it on a strictly emotional level). Yes! I thought to myself, yes, yes! I was the one with the power, and he was just a tiny little fragment of my life. 
123	2	a	And thats when my third realization hit me: nothing really mattered. Everything seemed extremely small and insignificant, all of my relationship problems, I mean. Seth didnt matter anymore, he was just another guy. A guy Id been heavily infatuated with, granted, but at the end of the day just another stupid, socially impaired guy. He was going to be part of my journey through life, of course, and he had changed a lot of me within this journey - but he was just a part. A preLy short-lived part, at that. 
124	2	a	And soon, everything in the room became scarily meaningless. 
125	2	a	Now, Ive mentioned in various other parts of this report how meaninglessness was a crucial component to most of what I felt... but now, it had become extremely so. Not only was I unable to process the inner meaning of everything, but it ceased to have a purpose altogether. Everything was nothing, at the same time. 
126	2	a	Ive always been a bit of a nihilist, but I never realized how much frustration this could have ended up costing a day-tripper me. I looked at the Keith Haring designs, all of them, and they bothered me because they were so open ended, they meant so much, yet nothing at the same time. The conflict my mind was feeling, in searching for a meaning that was everything and everyone, and nowhere and nobody, simultaneously, made me feel so irritated that I had to engage with humans. 
127	2	a	I hadnt realized it, but Summer had approached me, while I was feeling the empowerment (I think I mentioned to her how I was the blue man, and Seth the seal, my seal). She smiled really wide, and, I dont know why, but my vision chose to fall somewhere it never does: her nostrils. I kind of noticed how Summer had particularly big nostrils at that angle - she was looking down at me - and the blackness of her nostril was just spooky. The shape of it, weirdly angular, and her flesh so pale around it... it just made me feel gloomy and odd, and I perceived a macabre presence. The macabre presence of death - of the endless blackness in her little nasal holes.
128	2	a	I saw death. In your nostril!, just like that. Fragmented sentence escaped day-tripper me. 
129	2	a	That made her crack up big time. Summer quickly erupted in a long, loud string of laughter that made me feel, all of a sudden, warm inside again. The human presence, the human spirit, or humanity in general - they all reminded me that we werent robots, that we werent programmed to be cruel, to loathe, to hate. That was another instance where Lucy reminded me to love more, and hate less. Even Summers death-shaped nostril deserved some love, because it was part of my best friend, in the good and the bad. 
130	2	a	And love was quick to wrap me up in its arms again. Love was quick to take me in, with all of the wonderful other stem of heart-warming emotions Id associated with it. I thought about my reality, and how much love I felt in this new place, a new place Id moved to in a whim, surrounded by people I didnt know, and how they did love me already, and how I loved them. I felt far, again. 
131	2	a	I was far away from my sassy mother, from my hot-headed father, from my sweet doggie. I was far away from the incidents with my friends... but what got me going was the fact that I was so far away from the friend I loved the most: Lorence. Back in my home country, Id met Lorence about a year earlier, at my former best friends party. Lorence and I quickly bonded over music, and subsequently became bandmates. Throughout the year, our relationship had tightened, and 
132	2	a	he was (still is) one of the people I cared to keep up with and carry on in my life. He had been close friends with Frey as well. And it all connected - the meaningless meaning was meaningful again. I realized how much I loved him, and how much love there was between us despite the distance: what a beautiful friendship - he is my brother. 
133	2	a	And that, thats what made me break down in tears. 
134	2	a	Summer had been making some videos of us, (she still saw herself as the sober one, and Dianna was sitting in a corner, still in the grip of the mysterious ants that had made her manically break down in laughter) so that we could watch them afterwards, sober. I have seen these videos numerous times, and, according to the footage, I was laughing initially. 
135	2	a	Something happened along the way that prompted me to fall into thought (this is probably when I looked over at the Keith Haring sticker), and there is a pretty disturbing moment where I hit my fist repeatedly against the bed, while moaning in frustration. I think thats when the lack of sense of reality got really intense, and everything felt like too much, so nothing it meant was ever enough. I think that was my release of the weirdness. After that fisting session is where I break down and cry. You can also hear Summer, and her lovely voice, singing to me a kind of lullaby, and exclaiming, Wow, youre having a revelation, arent you? 
136	2	a	I nodded, and, apparently, felt very uncomfortable at the fact that she was filming, since I exclaimed, Stop looking at me! Stop filming me! Stop fucking filming this! as I wiped a tear away from my eye. Summer is Summer, so she obviously didnt. I looked straight at the camera for (what I realized later were) several seconds before resuming the tear-fest and, with Dianna- like wavy arm motions, announced Im letting it go; so much. And I was. I let go of Seth, I let go of the drama, of glorifying nostalgic pasts that had never existed in the first place. And it was beautiful. 
137	2	a	The video appeared to end right when we all began to laugh at my hideous gospel-like intonation. I remembered we laughed extremely loudly, to the point where I think Louise and Frey must have gotten scared at the door. Or maybe not. Probably not, no, they probably knew even better than us. 
138	2	a	So, I just told you what I was experiencing at the moment, and what I was physically doing. Notice how different those episodes and reflections seemed? On acid, progression and synchronicity dont really exist. A thought flows into the other, which flows into the other, and it all melts together in reactions and feelings. So, while this was going on, I still had the were all so small! realization fresh in my mind, which made me cry even more because I saw our reality as perfect, as little, as functional - when compared to the space and solar system. Because no matter small, it was still all love and beauty. 
139	2	a	Unexpectedly, (by now, at least) I dont know how long the crying went on for. I dont think it was that much, the tears were quick and cold, but it was so intense it slowed down. I cried every single happy feeling I had ever had in my entire life... or so it seemed like I was doing. It was like every happy moment in my life, which had caused me to feel happy in the past, was uniting in a explosion of euphoria and fulfillment. Through the tears I was releasing all of it: I was crying my life away. 
140	2	a	The emotional liberation I partook in had definitely drained my mind, and I was ready to lean back and trip it out. I sprinted to the living room, and, with shaky hands, picked up my laptop and headphones. Back in Diannas room, she was lying back on her bed, making funny faces and giggling as she stared at the ceiling. I decided to do the same thing, but with probably much different music. 
141	2	a	What to listen to became an overwhelming dilemma. I had awaited this moment for so long, that when it actually came, I was extremely conflicted. Since thinking about all of the possibilities overwhelmed me, I decided to let my thoughts melt into my one catchphrase for the trip, Im so far, I whispered, sighing. Immediately, I knew that I had to put on Spring Hall Convert by Deerhunter, as the lyrics of the outro clearly sing out, So far away.... 
142	2	a	I remember once reading, when I was fourteen, on the lead singers blog, about the origins of that song. There was a bright picture to go along with it of a girl; she was spreading her palms open wide below her chin, letting her long fingers frame her face, as a light shone directly on her peaceful expression. She had her eyes closed, and a soK, serene smile. According to the singer, Bradford Cox, that song was actually about states of consciousness, and morphine, (he has Marphans, so he wrote it at the hospital, while he was very sick) - but the picture was taken during an acid trip. During my own trip, all of those elements linked together: the peacefulness, the serenity, the pink shining light, the states of consciousness... that was the quintessential acid song, and if you ever trip yourself- I urge you to listen to it. Itll enhance the experience, no doubt. I mean, its preTy amazing to me on its own, and its very amazing to me on weed... but on acid? It was fucking incredible. It was auditory LSD, it was auditory art, it was auditory love. 
143	2	a	As I was transported through my hearing into another dimension, I decided to let sight join me in my venture. Turns out, visuals were much easier to attain once I just looked for them. The ceiling above us was this textured, off-white-yet-off-cream color, but the various granules of shadows that hit it transformed into shapes in no time. They began waving around, enlarging and retreating, a little like the sink before. It didnt take too long for them to become mitochondria-like pieces of paisley, and then little snakes! They had a very specific green-yellow- purple color scheme, which I found wildly entertaining: why would I remember color theory while tripping out? Because this is a magical substance, my friends. 
144	2	a	The shapes kept vibrating and moving around to the rhythm of the music, and I was in heaven. I was away. I was so far. They put on a real show, not too long after that. They spun, circled, and jumped at a steady and wondrously syncopated pace. It was like they were putting up a performance especially for me. They danced for me and my mind only. For the benefit of my entertainment, there I was. And there were them. Even though I thought I was the only person to see them, they didnt feel like they were part of my mind. They felt like something else. Utterly and entirely disconnected with my cervical perception. And looking for them was strenuous. Strenuous, but amazing, and well-worth the effort. Truly mind-blowing. 
145	2	a	We remained like that until I had to change the song, and thats the first time I had access to a clock ever since we dropped. After calling Dianna, who had still been staring at the ceiling and enjoying herself quite a bit, on her bed, by tapping her feet, I felt like I need to let all of my sisters know, Girls... my digital clock here says its only ti AM. Its only ti ftUYS!. Im not sure what I was expecting, probably some sort of insane time vortex to swallow me, and let me out when it had passed through normal perception. It felt like the whole night had passed. Like a thousand nights had passed, actually. How could it only be one? 
146	2	a	My question wasnt really answered, as Mark stumbled upon the door of Diannas room, opening it loudly, Dianna! He exclaimed, reaching out for the bed, You have no idea... I was editing the footage for the, um, the movie... then, then I decided to smoke up a bit before coming over. So I got the munchies, and I raided my suites fridge for something to eat... I found these cookies, and they were so good... I had like three of those, man. But they were edibles... so Im about to pass out... his speech wasnt upbeat as usual, but lethargically entranced into the dimension of sleep. 
147	2	a	I could imagine what being high and sleepy on weed would have been like, but I was so far! I was on acid, and that sight just saddened me. Weed seemed to be dull and boring, while I was in that state. Dont get me wrong, I would have gladly smoked my way out during the come down, but all the euphoria and inspiration I was feeling on acid would have been dulled out at that point, and by then I realized that this trip wasnt about enhancing visuals (which weed would have definitely aided me in), no, this trip was me exploring the realm of feelings. A realm I dont feel incredibly comfortable with on a daily basis. 
148	2	a	Because Im not particularly attached to Mark, and because I definitely didnt feel like I could confront repressed feelings in front of him, I knew, as soon as he lied on the bed and Dianna sat next to him, that I had to leave. I couldnt be in that room with Mark. 
149	2	a	Everything that was beautiful became corrupted. All the feelings of peace and empowerment were wiped out by anxiety and weakness. Marks energy wasnt my energy, and I wanted to leave immediately. 
150	2	a	I...I have to go. Now. I declared, clumsily grabbing my headphones and my laptop, and heading straight out of the room. Summer decided to leave the lovebirds alone, and followed me back into the common area. I read up that whenever the trip takes a sudden, negative turn, it was a good idea to change my surroundings. I headed out in the hallway, in my pajamas. I had made the smart decision to borrow a blanket from Diannas and wrapped myself around it. 
151	2	a	I went back to the spot where we looked at cars, sat on the railing by the balcony, and realized Summer had followed me there. She sang such a beautiful melody, I cant recall what it was, but her voice was beautiful and it made it sound... so far. I was far. I was far from her. I was far from singing. (I should mention, I used to sing too... in New York I still havent goTen the opportunity, or the balls, really, to go for it, and her nonchalance while exposing such talent brought me to a realization - the use of the quote marks is pivotal, in this case).
152	2	a	I teared up at the thought, and then attempted to present it audibly, I know my calling, I felt the speed at which the cold tear dripped down my cheek, Im a messenger; Im not an artist... I just wasnt meant to be I repeated bitterly. Summer frowned, What? What makes you say that? she asked. She seemed visibly startled, like Id just asked why it was wrong to commit murder. 
153	2	a	Ive been a sponge for this whole trip. Ive just been absorbing so much, and you girls produce! You and Dianna, you guys are so talented, and I just want to know people as talented as you. My talents, well, they dont really come through. I quit them, because they didnt fit in my life, and it means theyre not important to me. Im a messenger, I hold a voice, not the voice, yeah that should be close to what I said. I wasnt really explaining myself, as much as I was giving her excuses on my artistic laziness. To this day, this remains one of the most daunting moments of my life. I was so sure my future and destiny would have led me to a longing for creativity myself, that it scared me. Forever wishing, forever absorbing, and never creating. 
154	2	a	Summer was not convinced at all by my argument, but had probably realized how so far I was, that she didnt have the strength to prove me wrong. We theorized on the nature of direction (Why do cars even move?), the meaning of light (Why are lights on, why are lights on...!), and the altitude of New York City (Imagine jumping...!), before heading back inside. I was much more inquisitive than Summer, who, at every question, decided to wisely admit she just didnt know! with a smile of sincerity painted on her face. 
155	2	a	Once we were back in, I noticed Frey and Louise had put up some of our creations from earlier on during the night. They also showed us the results of their drawing game, which were interesting, to say the least! They were fun to look at, although they made me feel weird. As always, the acid-kind of artificial unsettlement in a reality that did not compute. At all. Louise then began to critique and comment them in a way I found so bizarrely formal, I like the negative space up here! she said, pointing to the white part of the swirls that Id been working on right after dropping. I hadnt even realized Id left a space... We should hang it up! she suggested. Summer seemed to think it was a great idea, but to me the painting was mediocre, and I laughed at the thought of someone wanting to look at it everyday. 
156	2	a	We then stumbled upon other swirls Id made, on another piece of cardboard, which looked weirdly familiar. Oh my god, this is definitely a thing... like a person, look at the face. Its cool Frey added. I inspected the lines and the strokes, then seeing that yes, it was someone. I dont know whom, but someone indeed. A blue face on a sea of red and gold features. Picturesque. Too bad I dont know where that one ended up, that one was the only one worth looking, I thought. 
157	2	a	Immediately after that, Louise and Frey adorably followed through their nightly routine of sleeping. Frey was going to sleep with her in her bed, and they were both going to crash. I was comforted that no normal people were going to be awake now. I needed to retreat into acid, after that intense hallway calling. Summer and I sat on the couch, and with shaky hands, began to type out our feelings. Me by pressing fingers, on this very same keyboard Im currently pressing fingers on, and her by tapping her phones screen. She came up with a magnificent poem, of glistening quality. Me, on the other hand, I did.. well, I did this: 
158	2	a	WE CAN BE EACH OTHER WITHOUT OUR BODIES.... BUT WE REPRESENT MORE. 
159	2	a	IF I TOOK MY SYMBOLS OUT OF ME - LIKE MY CLOTHES - WOULD I STILL REMAIN? THEY REPRESENT ME THEY REPRESENT ME AND I KNOW BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS AND WE ALL ARE AND I AM BECAUSE I KEEP BEING. I KEEP BEING AND I KEEP LOVING AND I KEEP EXPRESSING ALL THE LOVE AND ALL I WANT WITHOUT ME.'
160	2	a	I guess that was an attempt at explaining the fourth realization of the night, which dawned upon me as I was pressing said keys! I realized that on a day-to-day basis it was only what I had to define me, not who I was. It wasnt about my qualities, or my personality traits, no, it was about my clothes and my nail polish and my makeup and... it couldnt be that way. Not anymore. This experience was way too spiritual for me to deny my existence as a spirit. As a formerly incredibly nihilist-absurdist person, - I find comfort in chaos - I just couldnt accept meaninglessness anymore, no I had to build up my soul and believe in something greater than me. Something intangible. I needed to be more. 
161	2	a	Back in Diannes room, we could infer what was happening from the noise. She was clearly trying to get a quickie on with Mark, Please, please, please! we heard her tender voice beg, but it was to no avail. Mark was braindead on the sleep-syndrome, and not much fun was to be expected from more time there. She then walked out and came to check up on us. She looked visibly less literally antsy and euphoric than shed been all night. And thats when I had the most sparkling, brilliant idea of the night, Lets go out, I proposed. 
162	2	a	Summer, who wrote a play called Insomnia: The Musical, was clearly in for aimless walking at night on acid, and Dianna agreed on the premise that we were going out to pick up food for her. Since I hadnt had anything since the sushi, and had to keep my motor running for the trip, I agreed. We quickly went back to Diannas to pick up our clothes - we all gave up on bras... or other soaked underwear by that point - and put them on. I wasnt the least bit impaired, nor did I have trouble putting my clothes on, but I was still so far. I was still in an impossibly weird, nonsensical, and removed abysmal world of non-realities. 
163	2	a	I looked at the first paining Id made, as soon as I had my beanie back on. My way-too-material heels squeaked on the ground, and my way-too-material brown lipstick was thoughtlessly re- applied by me, with ease. This was almost automatic to me, and thats when the painting spoke. 
164	2	a	Len, it called me. Now, its not like I could hear the painting as a specific person, I knew it was mostly me doing the talking... but it seemed to come from the direction of the painting. So I aTribute the conversation I had as a conversation with a painting. 
165	2	a	Len, you made me!, it reminded me, You made me. You created ME. You can create. You can be! that was true. Dianna and Summer had noticed my affinity towards the painting, and called my name numerous times as I headed over to touch the paper, Summer is right. Youre wrong yeah, yeah I was! Just because I was experiencing so much, and forced to absorb it, it didnt mean I was never going to be able to produce artistic material ever again. Much on the contrary... 
166	2	a	You can do an be whatever you want! Youre here. If you made it here, you can definitely make anything. Stop trying to stop yourself. Quit qui^ng... the voice of the painting grew fainter, and as I kept stroking it, it has said whatever it had to say, and quieted down in my head. 
167	2	a	I looked back at the girls, who were still attentively watching me, The painting just spoke! It spoke to me. The painting spoke to me! It told me that you were right, Summer, you were right and that messenger shit is stupid. I can be and do what I want I declared my fifth realization, happily. If I have enough inspiration to produce, I will. Eventually. 
168	2	a	THANK YOU! Summer conceded loudly. And now, it was us against the City. 
169	2	a	This might, perhaps, get a little repetitive, but once we had made the decision to go to food (yeah, that was our destination), we felt, preTy much, sober. This might have been because, once you go back to a place of lucidity and intelligible, non-crowded thinking, it is hard to accept you might fall back in the trip. 
170	2	a	The type of hunger that we were feeling, by the way, was very unlike standard munchies from Mary-Jane. Lucys hunger was more along the lines of knowing that we were going to be awake for a long time, and having to keep our bodies running, in order not to fall asleep. 
171	2	a	Throughout the whole day, Id only had a Special-K Bar, coffee and the sushi from before, so I wanted to fill myself a bit. Just a quick snack: not like I needed food, but I wanted to nourish my inner self. 
172	2	a	When we headed downstairs, I remembered how I, originally (before the trip commenced), felt extremely worried at the idea of going out, or even having to sign myself in and show my face to the guards, high. My pupils were as wide as saucers, and I was still very physically tense and jittery. Thankfully, going out was actually painless. I tried to use my University ID to walk out, only to be reminded by Dianna that I didnt need it to exit... yeah, still very much not sober, am I? 
173	2	a	As soon as we went outside, in the cold breeze of early October, the wet tips of my hair tingled, and I felt almost like a sphere of energy forming inside me. It was regenerating, and it made me immediately fall within the trip again. I looked at cars, and how their bumpers looked like faces. I smiled and waved at them. Cars were like domestic animals: they reflected the people inside, so if I made friends with the cars, I would have made friends with everyone inside them. 
174	2	a	My childhood memories were back in the prime-time periphery of my mind. I remembered, back when I used to play this game, when I was in grade school, where I waved at drivers in the highway. Sometimes, they thought it was cute, you know? They smiled and waved right back. Others, just ignored us. Luckily nothing ever obscene happened (lets thank the innocence of my home country for a second here). Anyways, the cars were the owners. The owners were people. I was a person. They were like me! They were like me, and they also lived in my world. A sense of belonging in Union Square suddenly washed up over my body, and New York City had never felt more like my home. I was that little kid on the highway again, seeing everything, and recognizing it as new. I suddenly wondered, what would smoking be like? 
175	2	a	I picked a cigarette from my fresh pack of Marlboro 27s (oh, Europe thank you for making me smoke), and lit it up. Let me just say, even sober, I have a peculiar relationship with smoking- time. Some cigarettes burn away within the shuffle of one song when I commute home, while others seem to take ages to ash out as I walk through avenues and avenues. This one, to my amazement, was a strange example of the laTer category. 
176	2	a	It lasted forever. Maybe it was because Dianna was in a hurry to get to CVS - the closest destination to pick up some quick snacks at - but I felt like I stood there, huffing and puffing out in the middle of the night, for a very long time. Smoking always mellows me out significantly - I mean Ive been smoking for almost a year now, and sometimes, I still feel dizzy and lightheaded from cigarettes. Drifting in philosophical endeavors was calming, and as always, a given, as soon as I was mentally solo. 
177	2	a	Any activity I performed by myself encouraged me to re-evaluate my relationship with others around me, and as soon as Dianna and Summer began to walk around and observe the city lights without me, I just kept studying my cigarette and asked myself, What the hell is the point of smoking anyways? I might have said it out loud, but I cant remember. I smiled ironically, realizing how helpless I was in determining the answer to that conundrum. 
178	2	a	I walked over to Summer, and, holding my cancer stick, declared amusingly, This is the most meaningless act someone can ever perform. She smiled and raised her shoulders. What I loved about Summer is that she never had forced me out of my habits: here she was, completely relating to what I said, even if it was un-relatable for her. Nevertheless, it was pointless for something to be pointless on acid, so it suddenly came to me. 
179	2	a	The packs of Lucky Strikes that Lorence and I had split (he bought them, and basically picked a couple up and leK the rest for me, that bastard), social cigarettes over beer outside in the cold winter, nights of post-joint chain-smoking all summer long... it was all in my past, and it all shaped who I was. It was a stupid habit, yeah sure, but one that I could not shake. A little passport of memories that had impacted me just as much as my clothes, or ideologies. 
180	2	a	Summer still stood silent, and I smiled at her, even more abused when I added, But it does have meaning... for me, She looked back and raised her eyebrows, Really? she asked. I couldnt tell whether she was actually interested, or in her own world, faking it, but I thought it was important to respond, and present my sixth realization, It keeps my home alive, within me. Thats what habits do. Habits are just our ways to remind ourselves that were our own home. Theyre familiar, and keep a bridge between all the change... they just dont change. Obviously I was speaking for myself: a lot of people have found health and benefits in stopping to smoke, or whatever nasty thing they might have been doing. But I am not planning on it, I need to remind myself that I have a home within me, one that wont change no matter where I go. 
181	2	a	When I was finally done, we were ready to walk inside CVS and get something in our tummies (honestly, smoking has never made me feel less hungry, if I really wanted food), just as we were stopped by a young woman wearing a maxi-skirt and a brown leather jacket. She stopped us when she heard Dianna discussing the possibility of going to a more traditional restaurant, where we could sit down and be served. 
182	2	a	Oh girls, if youre looking for somewhere to eat you could go to the Cafeteria she said. Im sure whatever the name of the place was, it wasnt Cafeteria. Something along the lines of that, though. Dianna smiled and Summer responded, Oh we were just there earlier today, it was great! 
183	2	a	Ah, shucks! she said. She was holding a large tote bag, which she pushed over her shoulder. I observed her quietly, my first stranger on acid! She looked so quintessentially human, and in that basic humanity, I found an endless sense of peace and beauty. It was almost artistic, and art was love, so I quickly started to feel an overwhelming rush of love for that woman, Youre beautiful I remarked, interrupting the conversation she was having with Dianna, which was probably normal and boring anyways. 
184	2	a	Oh wow, thank you! she said. I dont think Id make the same observation in a sober state - this girl had crooked teeth, unruly frizzy hair, and was slightly short and stubby. Yet she was perfect, naturally effortless in her harmonious self, and I couldnt hold it in from her. As she walked away, she recommended some website for...something? Like a natural-remedy doctor, I think. I didnt know, neither did I care too much. I kept watching her small feet stumble through in heavy, dark boots. How could I tell her how faultlessly she moved? Your color is green! I announced as she headed in the subway. She frowned, and was probably a little weirded out, Ah. I guess Ill keep that in mind!, she said skeptically. Maybe she thought I was stoned. Maybe she recognized my condition! 
185	2	a	Dianna laughed loudly as soon as the girl was gone. And your color is teal! I said to Summer. This color assignment wasnt really based on anything more than my personal state of mind. I dont normally think people have colors, and nor do I see auras or anything... everyone simply had a color that communicated their personality.
186	2	a	How I came to those conclusions, I wouldnt know. It was some trippy synesthetic association I embraced, not much more to explain. 
187	2	a	The girls agreed with me, and quickly jumped on the bandwagon, Whats my color, Len? asked Dianna. I looked at her, her big, welcoming smile and tall, yet delicate, frame. Youre like, a light... light blue. She nodded slowly, probably trying to envision herself as a light blue, Yeah!, she acknowledged my judgment. I can see that too, Summer added. Dianna suddenly looked at me and emphatically remarked, Youre definitely red. Like an intense, blood-red. I smiled, Crimson I translated. I stroked my leK wrist, where my King Crimson-themed Larks Tongues on Aspic taToo lied. Man do I love that band. 
188	2	a	Then, finally, we walked inside CVS to get something to eat. Lucys distractions were entertaining, but we still had a goal. Humanity pulsed within that store, which I never notice on a daily basis. I always thought that CVS, Walgreens, or Duane and Reade were very plastic- looking places, sterile conglomerates for munchie-related needs. But in that moment, it definitely wasnt. They were still places for our needs, of course, but they were human, and life flowed within them. The music that played, some sort of 80s female-sung pop, was being chanted by a human, for humans. The magazines I looked at depicted humans, and other humans read them. CVS represented the mirror to my little human reality - a small corner on the small universe we inhabit. Tininess was incredibly comfortable, and incredibly human. Yet, not many of the commodities in the store made sense to me; in fact, I was still having a hard time processing the point and reality of objects around me, but I was still connected to this world. Undoubtedly so. Sadly enough, Dianna immediately realized that she the food was barred: Guys, the food is barred down. Lets go up she proposed, running towards the escalators. I knew the chances of us finding food upstairs were slim - the second floor mostly stocked up drugstore beauty products and pharmacy-related health items. But I wouldnt have missed the escalators for the world. Only the one going upward was properly working, and it felt amazing to be basically lifted up; so different from the everyday, almost chore-like, feeling of upward escalators - I was ascending. 
189	2	a	As we thought, upstairs was just makeup... and I had already too much of that, so we went straight down. Going down wasnt as magical as going up, since I actually had to use my legs. It was heavy-handed and slow. As I tiptoed my black heeled mini-boots on the pavement, I felt like I was a mammoth approaching. Yet, wed just crossed another bridge on our quest... it was taking us somewhere else, which made me thrilled and excited. 
190	2	a	Time was not one of our concerns on acid, so Dianna suggested us heading to Grand Central Station. I think she had some sort of asian or indian food craving, and told us that they had all kinds of restaurants inside. Off we went, just to check it out, first and foremost. My friends and I like to keep our options open when we go out: we rarely make plans or agree on timing, but in that moment, it seemed like we had all the time in the world, to see all it could have offered us. 
191	2	a	We entered the subway with dwindling conviction. I marched onwards, assertively leading the way, while Dianna followed in a haze of longer steps, but Summer seemed to hesitate behind us. As soon as we arrived underground, she stopped to look at us in the eye, I dont have my phone, she remarked. Dianna smiled, adding Neither do I! 
192	2	a	Summer turned to me, Len?, she called. I had considered taking my phone with me to blast some trip tunes as we walked along, but it felt unauthentic. So far, acid had warped the reality around me in a way that I had never experienced before, and I wanted to see what it could do with the natural sounds and rhythms of the city street-life. Reality needed to bend itself, in order for me to be legitimately surprised by it, and if I was listening to music, I would have altered the process drastically. So, in answer to Summer, Nah, no phone on me. 
193	2	a	One of us should have a phone. I think Ill just go get mine from upstairs. Its also a good idea to let Louise, Frey, or Mark know that were going out she said. Her argument seemed reasonable, but I was able to tackle it, for the sake of our destination, Frey and Louise are probably asleep, and Mark totally crashed on that bed, though. Do you think we really need to wake them up? Were just going to go to Grand Central, grab a bite, and come back. I made it sound so easy, and it was... for people not on psychedelic drugs. 
194	2	a	What followed was the most lingering moment of the Trip, the most annoying part of it all - climbing the stairs up, and down, up, and down. Dianna and Summer could not, for the life of themselves, make a sensible decision over whether to get the phones or not. I wasnt going to go, regardless: Id made my decision, and I needed to progress and move the night forward. What frustrated me about them two, in that moment in particular, was the fact that they were messing with the flow of time and events. They kept going back, and forward, wasting precious minutes, and unable to decide upon a direction. Thankfully, under my council, we decided to all ditch phones and embark on our little technicolor adventure. 
195	2	a	If I had to choose one single adjective to describe sitting in that subway, Id pick climactic. This is interesting, since taking public transport is one of the most bland things we do, on an everyday basis, or so I thought. I mean, if I were to take the subway today, Im preTy sure Id still feel preTy bored with the experience, but there is something undoubtedly fascinating with sharing space amongst strangers - united by the need for a destination. The subway appeared to me as a metaphor for my trip. It was a very paradoxical and meta-moment. 
196	2	a	I looked around, wondering how frightened or foolish I looked, as I couldnt help but feel extreme amazement: American trains were so different from the ones in my hometown. The digital destination maps, the clear lights, the improvised ads... it all made me curiously compelled... because, yet again, none of it made any sense, or mattered. The subway was a powerful metaphor, of course, but I still couldnt process it in terms of its separate components. I remember, particularly, how startled I was by the mechanics of transportation. It seemed like such complicated subject matter that I felt a deep respect towards whomever was in charge of taking care of it. 
197	2	a	On a more personal level, I suddenly started to stare at the two middle-aged men sitting in front of me: one of them looked Hispanic and pensive, while the other was a sleepy Asian. Such different people, probably with different lives, and different destinations. Yet for a few moments, they sat next to each other - closer than they must have goTen to the ones they actually longed for. We were all heading somewhere - to progress, to paTerns, to dreams. Their destination was just the same as mine, fulfillment. 
198	2	a	I honestly cannot find the missing link between this consideration, and what then evolved to become my seventh realization on acid. I immediately knew, the more I looked at those men, that I wanted no more secrets in my life, no more games, no more lies. I just wanted to be clean, out in the open with all of my feelings and emotions (something Ive always kind of struggled with). Secrets seemed like such an immature and trivial convention, with their scope being solely to prevent bonding, and deeper connections, with others. The only way to form these relationships was by being raw, and true to myself. To all of me. And that made me smile a lot. 
199	2	a	I thought about the mess that took place back home, before I leK, and once again, I felt surprisingly good about it. Originally, I was apprehensive and almost threatened by the possibility of that incident enticing bad thoughts, but it really didnt. I felt clean about it, because I had come clean for what I did. I had confessed and stated the truth, and I was so happy that it had actually taken place, because it gave me a chance to realize who my real friends, through it all, actually had been. I felt lighter, more genuine, more real. 
200	2	a	Once our stop was up, we exited right at Grand Central. No surprise to me, the station was closed. Oh crap!, Dianna exclaimed, I forgot its 3:30, and it closes at 3! she added, looking alarmed. But just as we were about to lose our peppy, wheat-blonde torch to light up our nights attitude, her sunshiny smile came right back up on her face, Lets go to Times Square! 
201	2	a	Without a word, Summer and I both knew that was exactly where we had to go. The premise of being in the most famous visually appealing place in the world, on the most famous visually appealing substance in the world, was alluring the three of us in the same exact way. And, at that point, we also had a similar level of lucidity within us, which made it very easy to find the right way towards midtown, just some twenty blocks away. 
202	2	a	I cant even begin to explain the satisfaction of reaching such a fun, bright-looking, spectacular part of New York... mostly because I was unable to process it myself. I was back in sponge-mode, taking in and absorbing all the feelings I could take in and absorb. Visually, it was a really heavy part of the trip - not because of any hallucination, but because the colors were so rich and vibrant that they made the city look alive. Another bit and trace of human soul, of human visibility, and humanity itself. Every single color told me a story, and transmitted a feeling. (I wish I could make more clear associations between colors and moods, but I never wrote any of it down, so Im afraid I have forgoTen exactly what vibes I got). 
203	2	a	A highlight of our ocular tour downtown was the enormous and flashing Desigual store. Some animations were being displayed on giant LCD screen panels; nothing fancy, just color blocks flashing and alternating - an epileptics nightmare. The shades were all neon, and all kinds of them appeared, but one particular succession that stayed with me was red-yellow-green, which filled me up with hope and happiness. I guess I do remember one of the associations I made, green = hope. Forever and always. 
204	2	a	When we got close enough to see the actual clothes, I was stupefied. On a central, headless, white plastic mannequin was placed a 60s-cropped dress, embellished by an optical illusion checkered black-and-white print all over it, which seemed to shake at every movement of my pupils. That dress was the staple definition of my old Literature teachers style, and I was sent back in my memories, as a cold tidal wave of old experiences washed over me.
205	2	a	Let me explain, for a second. This teacher, whom well call Ms. Potter, to make life a little bit more interesting and magical, was never particularly fond of me. I have never been famous for my native-language literature abilities, but the exam grade I received, at the end of my two years of IB Program, had definitely proved her wrong and exceeded my every expectation. But it wasnt in hatred that I thought of her, no. It was because, one particular afternoon of early 2012, when I was an overweight, fifteen-year-old brunette, as she was explaining the way humans relate to one another, she had advised us, If you want to learn how, and what, things you say can affect the meaning of whats being understood by those around you, you should study Communications, like I have. The topic had never particularly intrigued me, but Potter had a very considerable amount of knowledge on a vast array of interesting subjects. Unknowingly, I realized I had followed her footsteps, and I was studying Communications. Me, the now-skinny, eighteen-year-old blonde had demonstrated her that she had misjudged me, and that I did have a lot to offer. I felt complete - almost to the point where I wanted to send her an email when we went back to Diannas. Eventually I smartly decided against it, since my last aTempts at prose were pretty horrifying. 
206	2	a	Dianna, Summer, and I eventually found a deli that was open, and seemingly low-key. I picked up a box of hummus and pita chips, Dianna a croissant and a burrito, and Summer didnt get anything, since she claimed to have been eating cookies all night long. I knew that wasnt true, but I respected her decisions and well-being, so I let her be in harmony with herself. Really, the food and eating it turned out to be the most uneventful part of our commute back through the subway. I noticed that Dianna was studying the jelly texture of her brioche incredibly amusing way: she would squeeze it up in a nut-like shape, and then turn around to me while giggle-whispering, Doesnt it remind you of a vagina? (which yes, it totally did, by the way). 
207	2	a	Once we were back in the Union Square subway, Dianna paced up her walking and straightened her face with a pensive thought, Sometimes I feel like Im not doing anything here... she wondered out loud. This one hit me, like a slingshot in the back of my brain, and I had a brand-new weapon to argue against her: my eighth realization. 
208	2	a	That is absolutely not true. Youre doing so much, all the time. Even now, youre walking, youre breathing, youre talking, and thinking! Thats a lot, and its all simultaneously. Its amazing how much we can do, without realizing. Were constantly doing something, moving, accomplishing, progressing. We cant help but do. I definitely wasnt that eloquent when I commented, but in a nutshell that was my thinking. This is true, sometimes I still take for granted the amount of things I do - reminding myself that every action, every process, every succession is important, fundamental for my sanity and well-being. 
209	2	a	Despite the fact that mine was a response to Diannas complaint, the person who was most impacted by what I said was Summer. She seemed visibly shocked - her eyes widened, she shook her head, looked over and proceeded to thank me for saying that. I, like a good old snarky asshole, simply smirked and encouraged not to thank me for saying the truth. I liked my newfound wisdom, it built in me solid confidence and strength. 
210	2	a	On our way out of the station, we saw an elderly woman, who wore an all-black outfit consisting of leather pants, a cowboy hat, and cowboy boots. Her straight red hair was up in a tight ponytail. She noticed the giddy looks in our faces, and immediately smiled back, telling us, You three look beautiful together! For how long have you been friends? 
211	2	a	I dont know why I felt entitled to answer that question the way I did, I let my soul speak, Forever. I knew that that experience had made Summer and Dianna think the same, so, in their discrete laughter, I sensed newfound comfort in our friendship. I loved how at ease and in- sync we finally were. 
212	2	a	She smiled, small, golden teeth emerging from thin, purple lips, How long has that been? Seventeen, eighteen years? Nineteen or twenty? she asked. Dianna smiled and confirmed, Yes, more or less our whole lives! 
213	2	a	Well, you do look pretty young! How old are you? she asked again, but before Dianna could say a single word, the woman went on, No, wait! Ill guess it. Wait! I found that woman hilarious; we hadnt even moved ever since shed stopped us! She began to close her eyes, rubbing her palms together, and followed by asking Dianna a series of questions regarding her mountainy preferences, to then suggest a series of unlucky guesses, Is it Novembah? Octobah? Its gotta be late-Octobah-early-Novembah! her New York accent came through with its full force on the last desperate guesses, No, not really, Im sorry! Dianna added. Like it was her fault. 
214	2	a	She, then, moved on to me. One penetrating look, with her almond-shaped, glassy brown eyes, was enough to declare, Oh you girl. You girl, LOVE a camera. And the camera loves you. I wonder why she didnt even aTempt to guess my birthday, which is what she immediately moved on to try with Summer. I didnt catch what she asked, because, as Summer was supposedly beginning to answer back, we felt the cold, aseptically artificial breeze of a new train racing by. Oh thats my train. I will see you, girls. Stay friends! Please stay friends!, the woman said goodbye to us and ran downstairs, her small legs shaking furiously along with her frantic exposed tongue. 
215	2	a	We leK it unspoken, but all of us felt that was another sign, one that indicated how helplessly wed been bounded through this experience. Who that woman was didnt matter; the fact that she was terrible at guessing birthdays didnt matter; what mattered was the fact that we heard it from another voice: Stay friends! Please stay friends! And we were going to. And we are going to. Besides that, that interaction was just funny - it was just so obviously spiritual that it made me automatically take acid less seriously, as I nonchalantly commented, Damn. That lady was tripping harder than us, guys! Dianna smiled and asserted, Oh next time, well have some of what shes been playing with. 
216	2	a	By this point, both Dianna and Summer were coming down. Dianna still seemed preTy out of sync with reality, and I could see the cloud of acid-weirdness still dissipating over her mind. Her movements were still a little racy, and she was restless, but didnt seem to be too involved with herself anymore. Summer was a little more complicated to figure out, because her accounts of the story differ. In an upcoming part, I will provide evidence to support the fact that she was still pretty high, but throughout the whole trip, and while reviewing her experience in its entirety, she generally claims to have not experienced much, visually at least. Im not sure how true this is, but this report focuses on my story, my feelings, and my observations - so I will note my inferences. 
217	2	a	On another note, two half-blotters werent guaranteed to be particularly powerful, no matter how expensive and pure the acid we got, presumably, was. We were looking at about five hours of tripping and two of comedown on first-time users, like Summer and Dianna. I had had a full one, on the other hand, so I was nowhere near being done. Oh no. I was about to explode. 
218	2	a	When we came back, everyone in the suite was asleep. Summer and I sat by the living room, while Dianna was determined to wake up Mark, and test sex on acid. I was beyond thrilled to finally get to my snack - and am happy to report that eating with Lucy makes it even more fun! Even a pre-packaged and uber-processed hummus treat was heavenly, mostly because of the creamy texture. I was fascinated by how the crispy, hard chips mercilessly drowned in the dense sauce, and I moved it around multiple times, just to watch it dissipate. Eventually, I ran out of chips, and proceeded to dip and feel the sonftess of the chickpea-flavored condiment hands on - oh yeah, I used my very own index finger to ravish anything leK in that plastic box. Food was meant to be eaten and enjoyed, and I oughted to appreciate every last bit of it. 
219	2	a	Deciding we werent sleepy just yet, Summer and I turned the lights of the common area back on, and pulled out my laptop, to relax on the web a little bit. I was still convinced we were all coming down, so I visited a website off of my saved Reddit thread of cool links to check out while on LSD. The first one brought us to a remarkably trippy interactive visualizer, made up of retro-pixelated blobs of vanishing colors. As I moved the cursor, the particles of turquoise, bright yellow, and green hues would break apart in tiny red and pink ones, something which totally astounded me. I felt like my brain was melting as I stared at the screen, completely lost in those visuals. I guess that the thought that made me realize I was still feeling the acid was the simple fact that I was being entertained by that one single animation for too long, and a bit too intensely (Im usually one of those tab-whoring, three-hundred-miles-per-second, avid multitaskers, and have a hard time focusing on only one webpage, when Im at the computer). 
220	2	a	I tried a few songs to accompany the visualizer, but nothing was weird enough. I wanted something fucked up - something so completely uncanny and off-sounding that I could have rejoiced at its peculiarity. Summer gave me a few suggestions, but everything sounded too conventional. No, I need avant-garde shit! I said. And as soon as I did, I knew a record that was uncomfortably smooth enough: Tim Buckleys Lorca. I remembered it because of a particular comment on its Rate Your Music page, along the lines of Ive heard stranger things before, but this is the one Tim Buckley people will frown at you for playing at a party, and I really wanted a party of heavy frowns, right then and there. 
221	2	a	We stayed like that for some time - again, I cant tell you how long precisely, but it was quite consuming. The blobs on the visualizer began to look like lilttle faces even more than usual - I have extreme pareidolia on any kind of substance: I see faces in everything and everywhere, except for peoples features, where, ironically enough, they should actually belong. All the colors were turning into separated units of light and expressions. It was a kind of ordinarily divine, but I still assumed it was the end. It was very similar to feeling really stoned... nothing too out of normal highs. 
222	2	a	When the album ended, I found myself at a loss of what to do. The visualizer had been entertaining, but Id had enough. In the mean time, Summer had been writing haikus and lyrics, which made a lot of poetic sense, and I felt very jealous of her ability to create things that were so beautiful. I shook it off immediately, and invited her to sponge-out with me, Have you ever heard of ODDSAC? I asked. 
223	2	a	Nope, she answered, facing the screen. I smirked, Oh youre in for a treat. Its this movie made by the members of Animal Collective, a few years ago... its like a visual album. They even screen it here in the city, sometimes. As an avid AnCo fan, I knew about the short film, but Id never considered watching it while high. I knew it was weird enough to do the trick though, so we tried it. 
224	2	a	Its not my place to describe, or figure out, what exactly is going on in ODDSAC. Its a glorious mesh of visual, and hypothetical, scenarios that I recommend you check out for yourselves - so I will not spoil the surprise. I think we were about ten or fiKeen minutes in, when a very giggly Dianna and a tired-looking Mark emerged out of the room. For the movie, wed turned the lights back off, and their tall shadows announced to us they were going to be taking yet another shower. Summer decided to take a nap, as she felt very sleepy, and I was ready to follow her. 
225	2	a	We lied down in the dark of Diannas room, in her roommates bed. Summer was quick to settle into sleep, but, as soon as the lights were back off, I was in another universe. The springboard darkness gives anyone tripping is formidable, to say the least. When youre voided, your brain just works to fill it all back in with visuals. My dose was preTy weak, so thats why I think I was able to maintain my cool for so long, when out in the open. There was no chance I was immersed in complete darkness at any point before that part of the trip, and as I had already noted, closed-eye visuals were much clearer than open-eyed ones in the light. 
226	2	a	It all started with little sparkles of rainbow light, flying around in front of me. I didnt realize they were hallucinative in nature, at first. I just thought that it was late, I had been up and running for a long time... this must be some sort of trick my eyesight played on me, after brain had been processing information for a long time, which does happen sometimes. The truth, preTy literally, slapped me in the face approximately ten seconds, when the sparkles began to move... tiny little freckles of multicolored, intangible rain. 
227	2	a	And the more I looked, the more concrete they became. From sparkles, they became hairs, then wires, and then threads. I saw the colors flowing within them, pouring pigment sliding from end on end - it was all extremely hypnotic, I mean, I felt like I probably had this staggered look on my face, as I saw everything flying, and turning, and twisting. It was mesmerizing. 
228	2	a	They kept getting thicker, and thicker, until they turned into little pencils. They broke apart, and turned into classic B orange pencil-shaped rockets, which launched across the room in constant takeoff. As soon as they were in flight, theyd disappear, and new ones would form and fly. It was a spectacle, and it made me understand that I had taken acid, and that I was tripping, pretty badly, too. 
229	2	a	My stimulation prompted me to experiment with closing my eyes again, and my lord, am I glad I did it - it was insane. At first, I got the same hazy, dark fractals from before, but they seemed much more detailed. Still hazy, but detailed. They didnt stick around for too long, as the mandala I saw broke apart, and turned into a tunnel I was catapulted into. Thats when I got why they call this tripping. I thought I was in the front row of a roller coaster, which would take me to different sights, and stop at certain locations for a few seconds more. 
230	2	a	One of such stops was a discotheque. Not a club, not a bar, not a venue, but a disco-disco. There were bright magenta lights, and I saw a gorgeous african-american woman dancing. She had long, smooth legs and a sick, huge afro. She definitely didnt match my initial expectation of what I imagined Lucy must have looked like, but is now the most concrete envisioning I have of her - she was the acid! 
231	2	a	The roller coaster took me closer to her face, and as she waved her body from leK to right, I saw her big, velvety lips becoming larger, and larger. Then I radically turned leK and saw even more lips. There were lips of all kinds appearing before me: illustrations, animations, the Rocky Horror lips, my friends lips, the Flaming Lips... just so many mouths smiling and frowning, smirking and crying, through their teeth. Surrealistically majestic splotches of red and pink light bathed the scene with spice and gusto. It was great. 
232	2	a	Then, it all got really dark again. The roller coaster took me to a lot of spooky sights. I saw multiple devils, and interpretations of what the word demonic meant. I saw pure evil, and all that it embodied, but I wasnt affected. All of the skulls and skeletons (which, let me tell you, Ive been terrified of in the past), and smiling crows, and dolls turning their heads... they just didnt affect or scare me, at all. They were just inevitable. It was like, oh yeah, theres bad stuff in life, but it is part of life itself, so I couldnt avoid it. Nor did I want to. I wanted to face my evils, like I knew I was supposed to everyday, in reality. 
233	2	a	At one point, Summer leK to go talk to Dianna and Mark, who were out of the shower, and chatting in the common area. I was too immersed in my trip to care to hang out with others, so I just stayed in the room. I went back to the rocket-pencils and threads of light, which were now all happening at the same time, and it was glorious. They were joining together and spinning in circles, creating rainbow ferris wheels that circled at 3000 miles per second. 
234	2	a	Unfortunately, I, yet again, wasnt really paying attention to fact that an outer world existed, so when Dianna stepped in, announcing Summer was going to return to Blue C, I wasnt too thrilled. Summer encouraged me to stay and take a nap, but Dianna reiterated how worried she was about the possibility of her walking back by herself. We were just three blocks and half a street away, but I sensed that I was being kicked out. 
235	2	a	Yeah, Id definitely feel better if you went along with her Dianna said. Sure, no problem I responded, wide-eyed. 
236	2	a	I went back to the common area and picked up my boots again. Putting them on wasnt exactly challenging, but I definitely made no sense. I was overwhelmed by the reality of objects once more, and everything amazed me, in a way it never had. This state was probably reflected on my face, as Dianna brushed by my shoulders and asked, Len, are you okay? 
237	2	a	Wa-wa yeah! I responded, feeling like a little kid. I am a child, Im a lover being born, my mind sang lyrics, and my mouth clipped sounds. I was feeling fried, Girls, I dont think Im done 
238	2	a	tripping just ye-et! I announced excitedly. Dianna and Summer looked down at me with worried looks, and, as Summer helped me up, she spoke the words I could have never, No, youre definitely not. 
239	2	a	Summer seemed tired as we made our way downstairs again. My little computer of a mind was trying, more or less helplessly, to process the elevator, the exit, the cooler air outside... but still, nothing made any sense. As soon as we were in Union Square again, I asked Summer how she was feeling: Are you still tripping? 
240	2	a	She gave me a smirk, Nah, I was done for hours ago! 
241	2	a	The fact that she was in a post-trip mindset, and knew I was still way up, made my shield of vulnerability weaker, and I put down my guard to tell her exactly how I felt. I was scared I wasnt going to remember it, and would never be able to share it with her again in the future. That moment was all that mattered, and I needed to get emotional immediately, before I would have been European and proud all over again. 
242	2	a	Summer, I... I... I... I just love you so much. Youre just so important to me; youre like my soulmate, and after this, but, but even before, really, nothing is going to keep us away from each others lives! I addmitted, excited. 
243	2	a	Her eyes lit up, with an acid-enhanced glimmer, Oh stop! she requested, flattered, Im so thankful and happy that youre here, and that we did this together... you know what it is? Ive been trying to find it for a while, and now I know. You bring color, thats what you do in my life, you bring colors, Im aware this sounds like acid talk, but trust me, for Summer that is the most natural and effortless thing to say. 
244	2	a	She continued, Especially with your hair all curled up like that, you remind me of Penny Lane from Almost Famous! she remarked again. I was just as happy and hugged her tiny self. Wrapping my arms around her, I felt my bulky headphones weighing down my handbag: music. I needed music again! 
245	2	a	After a five-minute long, heartfelt embrace, I excused myself, and plugged in the headphones to my phone - which is my main source of music streaming. I was still way up there, so I conceded myself an artificial, soundtracked, short walk back to Blue C. I decided to play some traditionally acid-y modern music, so that it wouldnt have felt en[rely out of place and touch with my times. 
246	2	a	In terms of processing reality, this was the most intense part of my trip. As soon as Why Wont You Make Up Your Mind by Tame Impala, began playing, nothing made sense. Nothing made sense on a whole different level, a level so overwhelming and so intense that I just had to accept it, and succumb to my mental impairment. Trying to find an explanation on the most everyday - or, in this case, everynight - elements that I encountered down the street just was too much. 
247	2	a	I immediately recalled seeing one of Wests friends, about two weeks earlier, on magic mushrooms. He kept mentioning how reality seemed like too much, but I wasnt able to understand what he meant by that. Now, I definitely did. The paradoxes and problems with everything seemed all-too clear, and shapes and sizes uniting together made everything even more complicated. 
248	2	a	The intensity of those sensations was so heightened that I had to vocally express it, like when I was back in Diannas room, slamming my fist on her roommates bed. I released my energy by spinning around, twirling down the street, delightfully exhausted. As I saw cars passing, I felt even safer seeing the world continue running, and never stopping. This was my world, and I belonged, and knowing that was all I needed to entice an overwhelming wave of happiness, that, coupled with the phazed-guitar of the song, turned off my mental intelligence completely. I began expressing that sense of comfort with very loud, strange noises. They sounded like moans of pain, the ones we make when were stressed out and need to release stress. I mean, I definitely felt all-too relaxed, if anything, but my brain was so puzzled by what was around me that I couldnt help it. I couldnt hold it in, MMMMM... AAAAAAAAAH....MMMMM!!!
249	2	a	As we reached the market in front of Blue C, and I noticed some workers moving around, carrying grocery stocks in large, metal carts, I smiled at them, and at the blaring lights of the store preparing to open. A new day was dawning, and it was beautiful for me to witness it. Looking back, I guess Id recommend acid for people with depression, or whoever feels tired and useless with the world they live in. It is such a revelatory experience for all that we take for granted. Even a store opening up just didnt make sense, as a whole: it was all made of small parts - the connection between every single task was what made us able to perform activities. I was never an existentialist, but in that moment, I understood entirely what the philosophy entailed, and it was the truth. 
250	2	a	Acid has changed me in that sense: I cant be the nihilistic, life-is-just-a-giant-absurdist-salad thinker I used to be. Sure, I still love Camus and Nietzsche, but I regained so much more belief in human relationships and connections. Especially in terms of how much we all need each other to carry out our lives, and this assigns meaning to our actions and activities - our motivation to deepen the affinities between us, and others. 
251	2	a	When we walked inside Blue C, Summer made sure I had my University ID prepared at the entrance to enter in the building. Yet, yet again, I wasnt impaired. Tapping the card and pressing the digits that represented my birthdate wasnt difficult, it was natural, it was all that I needed. I remembered my birth, and where I was now, and the recurring thought of how far Id come from my Nowhereland made my knees weak with joy. 
252	2	a	Quite literally, seeing as, as soon as we entered, Summer felt the need to sit at the columns that supported the three massive towers of Blue C. It was our courtyard area, and despite the air getting gradually cooler, as fall grew harsher, I wasnt bothered by being outside. No, I was glad I was. Summer was sitting in front of me, her knees in her hands, her head resting on the wall. She looked at the cloudy moon we were having that night, and I thought about how her round, pale face was a moon of its own. It was all I could focus on, and as soon as I set my eye-spotlight on it, all the posters and signs that were up started to melt again. My brain rejected anything 
253	2	a	that I wasnt intently making the object of my attention, I observed. My reality was too intense and complicated, and I couldnt even focus on it anymore. 
254	2	a	Because of my state, Summer offered me to go to up to her suite. I accepted eagerly, seeing as the loK, which I clearly didnt belong it, was most definitely not where I had to be. When we stepped in, Summers suite mate, Amaya, was still awake, video chatting with some of her Indian friends. She was originally from Mumbai and oKen missed on sleep to keep in touch. We asked her what time it was, and she replied, Its six thirty AM now, I might go to sleep soon!. 
255	2	a	For some reason, seeing a new person and a new environment revamped my acid-minded state, to the point that all I could see of Amaya was her radiant beauty. She emanated a sense of well- being and my eyes widened as I stared at how regal she seemed: her tan skin, large brown eyes, and rich black hair made her look like an Indian goddess. I remembered how once, when I was telling her about Seth, she told me that I was actually perfect, and that I needed to find someone who would appreciate it. In that moment, she was the one who was perfect and beautiful, and I felt like I had to tell her. So I did. 
256	2	a	Amaya, youre so beautiful! I said, in an unusually high-pitched singsong voice. Just like everyone else, on acid, she had a color, Your color is like an amber orange gold. Youre so beautiful! I repeated, startled at my sight. As I spoke, I paced back and forth all around the suite. A place that I was so used to seeing seemed so different, and I thought that if I explored it all through I would have regained the familiarity. Amaya, initially amused, looked, to an extent, concerned and said, Oh my gosh, youre drunk, arent you? 
257	2	a	She helped me into her room, Sit, sit, youre drunk. Sit! I wasnt surprised she misunderstood what substance I was on, mostly because Amaya doesnt really give into the outer-wordly, psychonautic ventures we partake in. She quickly introduced me to her friends on the other end of the globe through her large computer screen, and I waved excitedly, Guys this is Len, she's drunk... shes a little off, but shes fun! 
258	2	a	Nah, May, I just dropped a tab of acid I remarked nonchalantly. I had never been in Amayas room, so a new place helped me settle down. Immediately as I said, I heard a loud collection of delayed gasps coming from her computer, WHAAAAT! her friends exclaimed in unison with her. Why did you do that?! she asked. I smiled calmly and said, I dont know, it seemed like a fun time. Its great, really I awkwardly responded, looking around all over her small dorm. 
259	2	a	Summer briefly walked in to inform me that she was going to sleep, as she had to take a train to Long Island to see her friend Lola, later in the morning. I decided to follow her, but as soon as I asked her whether I could crash there, since her roommate was absent, I had the horrible sensation she wanted me out of there immediately. I kept insisting I had to leave, and that irritated her to no end. She finally exploded on me and accused me of acting like a bitch! 
260	2	a	It was just a split second of rage, but it was a kind of rage I had never seen on her soK features. Immediately after the release of her emotions, she apologized, affirming she had been consumed by what had overtaken her. I didnt care much of it, since the room was dark and I was distracted by the visual patterns that were forming on her pale face. Her bed, which was positioned way up, was hard for me to reach, so she helped me up, and we sat watching her roommates polka-dot comforter change into a variety of shapes.
261	2	a	They melted and moved downwards, falling into the endless ground, and breaking apart to regenerate again. They were black, and the rest of the baby pink blanket formed a series of tubes that would connect rainbow pipes from dot to dot, sparkling as they moved. The beauty of that vision had me entranced. 
262	2	a	Im so glad we listened to West and decided to take the acid instead of the shrooms, I said. That prompted Summer to ask me a vaguely unrelated question, Would you ever do West again?
263	2	a	I thought about it, but it was hard to come to any sort of long-term conclusion on casual relationships on acid. Deep within me, I knew my relationship (and I dont mean romantic) with West was more or less meaningless; it was something I had thought about while I was sober. Yet, on acid, I had no opinions, no desires, no sense of what made sense and what did not, so, I ended up repeating I dont know at least fiKeen times. Yet again, I was a neutral sponge.
264	2	a	That was when my ninth realization washed upon me: everything fluctuates, especially moods and feelings. Nothing had remained the same, and nothing ever would. Life was about bonds being formed and destroyed; people bridging out into our lives and then leaving, often without a physical trace. No single thing ever really stays, it all becomes something anew. From the bed, I looked to my hands, and my chipping nail polish, and I saw beauty in it too. The beauty of breakdown and decay, the beauty of the real end of everything. Not because it revealed my naked nails and prompted a new canvas, rather the decadence itself had a particular fascination about it. I was intrigued by life running its course, tangibly and emotionally. 
265	2	a	I was overtaken by emotion and found myself retreating within, so I leK Summer alone to get her sleep and walked over to the mirror. The last time Id seen myself was before wed leK for Times Square, so I wanted to check on how my lipstick and wild hair had been doing. It seemed amusing to me how people dont recommend looking at their own reflections in the mirror on acid, yet I would have been way unhappier with my appearance if Id been sober: my hair had fluffed up significantly, and all that was leK of my dark brown stain was a dry-looking line along the outer edges of my lips. I looked so different than I used to on a daily basis. 
266	2	a	My pupils were almost occupying the entire rim of my iris, and one could barely tell what my eye color was. The more I looked through that thin stroke of hazel-brown, the more I penetrated my soul and saw within me. The trip I took inside myself helped me better articulate my fourth realization, turning into my tenth. My essence, now displaced and unfamiliar, seemed absent from my reflection. I could be without my body, because all I needed was clothes and accessories to define my iconography, as opposed to my soul.
267	2	a	It was an ebbing sight and feeling, to know that my commodities seemed more representative of my persona, rather than my character. I knew what the purpose of my trip had been, right then and there, I needed for my soul to be sole definitive factor of me. I needed to feed my spirituality in order for that to become the only nourishment that mattered. 
268	2	a	I kept breaking through the surface of that mirror: fucked up hair, barely any makeup, no underwear... and I saw the truth beyond me; everything I ever meant and represented, and it had never been any clearer. I was just there, as myself, as the one, true me. And I could only see it through, and because of, acid. 
269	2	a	After that, I was ready to let my mind hallucinate me to sleep. The paTerns that I saw would have been my lullabies, I thought. I went inside Amayas room, in order not to disturb exhausted Summer. She was preparing to sleep too, and, seeing as her roommate Maria wasnt there, invited me to crash on her bed. I readily accepted, and watched as she turned off the light. I looked around myself, saying goodbye to my acid-sight, and ready to feel it all falling back into everyday place. 
270	2	a	Obviously, its not like I had tremendous amounts of control over what I perceived, and Amaya did have a night-light, or some derivative that reflected light, and the room wasnt pitch black. I was able to see her Suits large poster hanging off the wall: it showed two shadows of tall men wearing suits, both black, blurred out silhouettes, against a purely white background. I saw them melting and morphing in front of me. I felt like I was watching an optical illusion, as they blended and harmonized with such a contrasting, solid, backdrop. 
271	2	a	I kept my eyes open for a few more moments, and as I listened to Close Chorus by A Sunny Day in Glasgow, I saw the threads of light return, and become little nals, that flew around all of us and made me feel peacefully, dizzy. They began to quietly explode, becoming fainter and fainter, until I had to squint to properly see. They were the sleep-inducing fireworks of the night, a perfect way for me to finally close my eyes. At that point, I saw magenta-pink and black fractals, nothing too generic, and always dark... until I lost myself into sleep, consumed by the fantastic trip Id had. 
272	2	a	I estimate that I fell asleep about an hour after I arrived at Summers, at 7 AM. Considering we dropped our doses at 8 PM, I was really satisfied with my eleven-hour-long acid ride. Especially if we factor in that it was just one tab, it still gave me a rich, but not-too-intense experience, a great introduction into the world of psychedelics. 
273	2	a	At about 9:30 AM, Maria came back. I dont really know much about her, but she seemed nice as she requested me to sleep on the couch, which I was more than happy to do. I had a horrible headache, so I was excited to continue my resting phase. When I got up, I could tell Id definitely come down, and there were no more visuals or intense feelings, but the world still didnt make much sense. There was something just off about the world, at that moment. 
274	2	a	I actually woke up at 1:30, with a deep desire for a rich brunch. Not really because I was hungry, but the idea of scrambled eggs seemed familiar enough to stimulate a link back from the off- world. I said goodbye to Summer, who lamented being extremely tired and still having to visit her friend in Long Island, and joined Amaya downstairs to get a meal in me. I am not going to lie: I was [red. I was exhausted. I could barely process what the next day was going to involve. 
275	2	a	I was definitely down by that point, but I still struggled in processing everyday furniture. I dont know why objects were so tough on me, but they just looked complex. As we prepared to head to the cafeteria, we passed by the courtyard which had circular tables and benches all connected to each other, and those still seemed weird to me: why; what does this mean? What does it represent? It doesnt make sense, I concluded. 
276	2	a	Eating was peaceful enough, and as Amaya met up with some other Indian friends, I leK to go back to my loK and do a reading. Concentrating without falling asleep was hard, and at one point I saw the words wave and dance around a bit, but it was all tiredness and brain chemistry feedback from LSD. I decided to pick myself up and have dinner with Remy, as we were supposed to exchange psychedelic stories. It was raining faintly across the sky, and it was that rain that represented my spiritual growth. 
277	2	a	As Ive mentioned, Im very sensitive about my hair. Not only was I rocking my wavy locks, but I noticed the raindrops were soaking me - and I didnt care. Their delicate texture reminded me of the threads of light, and as my phone screen got wet too, I saw the drops becoming rainbow- colored on the screen, a totally regular, everyday thing. Yet, to me, it became something more. A flashback to my unforgettable experience: it made me want to cry; it reminded me of happiness, and belonging within the universe as a part of the human population. 
278	2	a	Now, whenever I think about being on acid, my heart thumps and drops a little bit, as I struggle to remember what feeling all of that love was like. I want to learn how to love more, and hate less; how to incorporate this richer knowledge and peace into my life. Now, whenever I think about being on acid, my heart thumps and drops a little bit, as I struggle to remember what feeling all of that love was like. I want to learn how to love more, and hate less; how to incorporate this richer knowledge and peace into my life. It was a life-changing first, and definitely not last, experience with LSD.

281	2	a	This experience happened to me about a year ago, March of 2017. I was young and stupid, and I had been experimenting with lots of different drugs at the time. This was the third time I had ever consumed LSD, and very stupidly so I did it in a park in broad daylight. 
282	2	a	I had managed to pick up about two 100ug tabs off of a very nice dealer that I used to know (he's dropped out of the business unfortunately), and I intended to drop them in the middle of a park, ride it out and go home later that night. My reasoning for doing this at a park was because I couldn't really afford to drop it with my parents in the house (again). I still to this day have no idea why I couldn't have just waited for a better set and setting, and do it with a friend that I trust. I have ADHD, so my naturally impulsive behaviour may play a role in my quite frankly stupid decision making at the time. 
283	2	a	So I popped the two tabs under my tongue, did the usual 'if it's bitter it's a spitter' routine. No taste, seemed to check out fine. I managed to find a nice quiet spot in the middle of a park to relax, and just have a good time. I waited in anticipation for the acid to kick in (Roughly 40-45 minutes for me). It was a really sunny day, the birds were singing their songs and I generally just felt quite pleasant. 
284	2	a	So the first thing I noticed was that the clouds in the sky started to morph, and I managed to interpret some cartoonish faces. After the LSD had entered my system the effects were quite acute and sudden in terms of onset. I managed to sit up and observe my surroundings in the park. The ground seemed to move in waves like an ocean, with the grass changing into a multitude of different colours and patterns. It was like I was in an ocean of pure bliss. The sky and ground seemed to move as one, sort of like a conjoined entity. I saw a couple walking in the distance, and felt like I could connect to them both emotionally and experience the love that they have for each other. Now at this point, I realised what I had gotten myself into. This was getting pretty intense for me, due to the fact that my sense of reality had already started to distort. I managed to find a tree nearby, and sort of telepathically connected to it. Asking it for guidance without words (in a way). Now, this tree seemed to tell me that I needed to go home and sit this out in my bedroom (Which to be honest seemed to be quite a sensible idea, tripping balls in a public space like that could have gotten me in serious danger). Rather than make me panic, I managed to retain myself and wandered to the entrance of the park. At this point everything was warping around me and it's probably a miracle that I managed to make it home unscathed. The concrete below me was 'breathing', and I sort of felt interconnected with everything. I stumbled onto a bus and hitched a ride home. 
285	2	a	I instantly ran into my room as soon as I got home, stripped myself down naked and just completely lost control of my body. I collapsed into my bed, and proceeded to melt into my bedroom. I felt this sort of spiritual energy flowing through my room and me (almost a bit like the force in star wars), and essentially let go of my consciousness and let it fly away from my body on this 'wave', like an ocean current. I had some sort of higher being connect to me telepathically again, but this time it seemed to tell me the language of the universe. It made me see and understand how the world works, and that all of my worries and regrets were complete bullshit. It taught me that the world and all of the crap that comes with it is merely a social construct. When it comes down to primal instincts, none of it matters. It transported me through a galaxy of wordless philosophies. Things like this are only explainable when one actually takes the substance. 
286	2	a	Towards the end of my trip, my mother walked into my room to find me without anything on, tripping balls and seemingly unconscious. She called my father and a paramedic, fortunately I was coming out of my journey at this time. When I came to my senses, I had never felt more ashamed of myself, at how stupid I was. How could I disappoint my mother like that? Nevertheless, it wasn't a bad trip at all. It's just the disappointment I experienced afterwards.

289	2	a	After doing shrooms, and ecstasy numerous times I had been wanting something more intense, something that would change my whole aspect on life. I remembered my dads stories about lsd and when he was my age, and thought to myself I need to try it.
290	2	a	I asked around for months for this substant and know one had any idea where to get some. Until this one day one of my friends told me he had just took some the weekend before that was named Sunshine Acid.  My heart instantly started racing when I heard that. That day after school, we went to the dealers house and finally got a hold of it.
291	2	a	Me and another friend took our doses that coming weekend at about 6 o'clock at night, and headed downtown on our skateboards to the skatepark.
292	2	a	One and a half hours of skating had gone by and we had hardly felt anything, so we started thinking it was bunk.
293	2	a	Another half an hour had went by, and I could feel a weird , but good body high come on to me. I looked at my friend and told him we better start heading out....
294	2	a	We were walking by the park which had alot of trees, almost like a forest. The trees started reaching over us on the road and the grass on the ground started turning bright colors. This was still the begining
295	2	a	After another hour of skating town, not knowing where to go, we realized we were way to high to skate, so we decided to head to a friends. When we showed up there, there was loud music being played, Tool I recall. When I got inside the peak hit me. I was zoned out to the walls mealting down to the floor too faces coming out of the wall.
296	2	a	Zoned out to the walls for about a half an hour, I told someone to plug in a movie. They put in chronicals of narnia(crazy on lsd). I had never seen that movie before, and the only thing I remember from it was wolves coming out of no where, and they freaked the shit out of me. After an half an hour of that we decided to get a ride home.
297	2	a	It was now about 10pm, and we were still peaking, heading home in a car. They dropped us off a block from my house, and made us walk in the dark.  I remember walking up the street and seeing big cracks in the ground, and orange stuff coming out of the cracks, almost like lava. The trees around us were spiraling up high in the ski, and were white with little color on it. Everything had seemed so detailed. Finally we had arrived in my house.....
298	2	a	I instantly layed in my bed with the lights off and just zoned out. In my head I could see shapes and patterns changing color, and I kept hearing car horns, and other strange sounds. I had then thought I had lost my mind completly. I kept telling myself that I had lost my mind.
299	2	a	After being scared for about an hour my friend asked me if I wanted to play some video games. I usually didnt like video games until I decided to try it out on acid. This calmed me down way more. That and the weed. 
300	2	a	We played games until we seen light out side, and decided to go to bed before my mom woke up to go to work.  We sat in the room trying to go to sleep but it just wouldnt work. I'm always moving your body around. We ended up pulling and all nighter not getting any sleep.

302	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), First Times (2), Various (28)
303	2	a	First of all I've been in love with this substance the first time I tried it about a year ago its absolutely incredible...
304	2	a	This was my second time to trip on lsd... I took two hits with a girl I dont kno and with sum friends that were rolling(x)...we were at my friend M's house which is where every1 usually goes to trip...
305	2	a	So my trip kicked in and I was lovin it of course and my friend M had one of those electric light things when you touch it the electricity moves with ur finger and is all in different colors and some go with the music ur listening to...well me and this girl became absolutely mesmerized in the beauty of this thing and played with it for around an hour or more and watched the lights dance and follow our fingers and we also saw dancing men dancing around the world in it...
306	2	a	After a while of playing with the light I thought of something to do which was start a bonfire outside in M's backyard, M was like hell yea lets do it but I dont have any wood. So we ended up using this wooden dresser that no one used and me and him had to carry it down the stairs outside and got the other girl that was trippin with me (I'll just call her shelly), we got outside and we were still mesmerized with the beauty of everything and we left mark to set up the bonfire while me and her stood and stared at the grass for about an hour and a half...the grass was like a whole new spiraling world of mysterious beauty it was wonderful...
307	2	a	About maybe 4 hours into the trip me and shelly walked back inside to see the 2 ppl rolling sittin in the kitchen me and shelly walked in there for sum reason which I cant recall and I'm sure we forgot anyway but we looked at each other in the eye and started talkin to each other through our MINDS! It was telepathy and we were like holy shit can u hear me and she was like yea I'm hearin u and I was like this is insane!! And she was like omg this is craaazy but this was all said in our heads and the two ppl rolling were looking at us like wut the fuck?! (me and shelly were talkin back and forth with our minds but also using lots of hand gestures and just looking at each other)
308	2	a	Me and shelly continued to stare each other in the eye and read each others minds, our eyes and minds were completely connected it was so weird I dont know how to explain it and when our eyes were connected all we saw were each others warped faces, our faces would stay where they were and I watched her body float up and dance in the air with her head still as it should be...it kinda reminded me of one of those cat clocks, where the cats head stays still but its body ticks
309	2	a	I was sick of being inside I had such a yearning for the outdoors so everyone else stayed inside and I went outside and sat at a table by myself and watched a tree/bush across his yard for a while....the bush started swirling into infinityand it changed into a dragon swirling a few times it was wonderfully beautiful, but after about 1:30 or so I went back inside to socialize...
310	2	a	It was early in the morning and I was starting to come down now, but patterns and colors were still swirling and making their way in my field of vision.
311	2	a	All in all every trip I've had has been wonderful I dont think theres a better drug out there, LSD is magical and purely spiritual...I feel so at home and at place in the world and pretty much all knowing (or at least I do)... LSD is beautiful and should be treated with respect...theres nothing better or a more incredible feeling than being on it... Me and my friends have never had any bad trips by keeping open minds and stay happy, no worries, and wel have the most beautiful, amazing, enlightening experience ever!!!

314	2	a	I was at a party with my friends and we were waiting on E, which eventually never came around, so our buddy offered us acid for $10 a hit. I took my first hit around 9:45pm that night. At around 10:45 I barely felt anything, but had extreme euphoria.
315	2	a	By about 11:00pm, me and my friend 'Jack' decided to take a walk up to the goat farm up the road. We always went up there drunk looking to kill a goat. I took my second hit when we got up there. I got up to a goat and just started to pet it as I looked at 'Jack' and said 'Do I punch it?' We both decided it didn't seem right to do so. About that time we heard a loud crash that started echoing in my head and ran.
316	2	a	Back at the party around midnight we went on the roof and played with the shapes of the clouds. The visuals made it possible to separate them in the sky with my fingers. Back in the house I saw Jacks girlfriend walking around like a ghost. The tracers got really intense from then on.
317	2	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
318	2	a	Around 2:00am, me, Jack, and Mark decided to go to our friend 'Mary's' house. We drove up the road as it swerved left and right. It was coming at me in all different directions. We got on the highway and all the lights were neon streaks. A Maryland State Trooper drove by us so we decided to go left into a parking lot to get away, even though he already drove by. It seemed like a good idea at the time. So for about 20 minutes Jack and Mark are trying to direct me out of the parking lot as were just going in circles. Eventually we exited after nearly going into oncoming traffic.
319	2	a	When we finally got to Marys neighborhood it was like driving in fairy tale land. All white houses with white picket fences. We pulled into a long driveway and kind of got lost there. We went back and forth. When I realized I was tripping out too hard to back up, we looked for a place in this driveway to turn around. Mind you its past 2:30am in some neighborhood we barely know. We thought there was a field to the right I could turn my truck into, but it looked like it dropped off into a cliff. When neither of them would get out to check, I put on the brake and went and petted the grass to make sure it was level. It was, so I proceeded to go through and turn around.
320	2	a	When we left the neighborhood we went to Dennys where all our friends were. Only 4 of us went in, and thats where I really started to trip. I sat at the marble table as it seemed to smear and fold all over itself. The hairs on my arm started waving like I was under water. When I decided Im tripping to hard, I just walked out freaking out hardcore but maintained to keep my cool. When I attempted to drive back to the house with Mark, I stalled the truck out twice. Driving an automatic would have been the more logical thing to do.
321	2	a	When we got back, I took another hit and the rest is history. My mind was pretty gone. I dont know how I was able to walk around at that point. I vaguely remember chewing on my shirt and beating a drum along with staring at myself in the mirror for over and hour because of how crazy my face was changing. My shadows made me look like Jesus and I smoked over 2packs of cigarettes in less than 6 hours. I tripped for a good 14hours.
322	2	a	I recommend tripping if youre NOT DRIVING. Granted it was the most fun thing Ive ever done in my life, it was probably also the dumbest. I really SHOULD have died with my friends. DO NOT DRIVE.
323	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
324	2	a	Before this I took LSD about 5 times, starting with a microdose, gradually up to 240 ug. 
325	2	a	My friend N. Pick me up and I took 3 tabs of Kali Yuga x 110 ug, claimed by vendor at 99% purity, made from the swiss bliss crystal.
326	2	a	T+20 min: I felt that it is going to be the deepest trip in my life. 
327	2	a	T+40 min: I was sitting in a car while girls were shopping. The gray fence in my right was dancing like a snake and was my last connection with reality.
328	2	a	T+1 hour: somewhere from a distance I observed our company arriving to a wonderful loft apartment in the middle of the city. N. asked me to take a bag from his car, but I stared into eternity in response.
329	2	a	T+1:30: I remember lying on the couch, as usual, and N. tried to set up music.
330	2	a	T+2 hours: immediately after that I saw him lying on the floor and screaming with a smile: HOW DID WE GET HERE? WHO AM I? as his wife was nearby and calming him down. Then he stood up and asked: How do you like this, guys?
331	2	a	*** there was me, N. And his wife, Also we were expecting D. and his wife S. was already with us. ***
332	2	a	Somewhere at that time I was completely sure that I was dead, I was observing N. having the best time in his life as S. asked me - is this okay? I told her that N. is god now. Then I told all them that I almost could not see them because I was seeing only fractals and eternity. There was no understanding of time, who I was, what was my name and if I was doing something in my life. I understood that there was no point in any fear, even of death, because even if I die, I will be reborn and I will meet exactly these souls in their mortal shells, and we will get whacked as usual. And this already happened countless times. This was the moment I realised that at 330ug we really need sitters, but there was no fear. Fear was pointless. 
333	2	a	I saw future and past, I was a god. I was beyond particles, I was energy. Then we all danced in joy, drawn with crayons and listened to our favourite music. Our bodies also needed to eat and to drink. Of course we also smoked weed and drank wine. We were dressed in comfortable clothes, we were shamans.
334	2	a	When D. Finally arrived, he was running to join us, shrefding his suit and jumping into sweatpants as I was crying from happiness that he finally arrived. Than N. waited until D. was hit by LSD and told him:
335	2	a	'D. Remember your worst childhood nightmares and face them' to which D. responded: 'There are none, I am god.' Then we ate pizza and ice cream. 
336	2	a	All this looped for eternity as we explored the apartment, revealing new rooms and activities. I was thinking that I wanted my girlfriend to be here with us, but she was not ready yet. I also realised that I love seeing people so happy and I was willing to break law and morals to see people happy. Their tears of joy shined upon my mortal body and cleansed my soul.
337	2	a	Next day 11 in the morning (now tripping almost 20 hours)
338	2	a	I have not slept all this time as sleep was meaningless. When my body felt tired, I just had to shift my attention to my hand that was drawing tantric symbols, as I was trying to compose my personality in silence. N. took his car home, as he then told - he was driving completely safe, his body was just going home automatically. 
339	2	a	About 16:00 next day I came home, threw my clothes on the floor, turned on video of guided meditation by Alan Watts and went into a meditation that lasted until 22:00. Then I ate some rice, checked my email and went to sleep, smiling at my future and being so intrigued of what will happen after I die. I knew that the best part is ahead.

341	2	a	I have done acid 9 times before this. I have had my experience with cannabis, alcohol, MDMA one time, datura one time. I am a above average college student pursuing Computer science and I am very interested with Artificial intelligence, philosophy, chemistry and science in general. 
342	2	a	I made up my mindset before this trip by no one ever could have ever ready me for what I was to experience in the journey ahead. I took 2 blots with my friend who is 2 years younger than me. He took half a blot as it was his first time. My school friends A and F stopped by my home just after I took the blots. I told them to not to give any bad thoughts beforehand. 
343	2	a	At about 7.45 pm I felt the acid kicking in. That surge of LSD through my brain rendered me anxious and excited. I started smiling uncontrollably. 
344	2	a	At about 8.10 pm my friends  left my place and me and R were sitting down in front of my laptop listening to music. The visuals had already begun to take hold. I couldn't place my thoughts in an ordered way so I let myself roam. After about some time, R was taking about this new feeling he was getting that he never felt before. I wanted to guide him properly but I couldn't properly shape the words as per I wanted. We were looking at my abstract wall painting. It has wavy shaped strokes in a ocean blue color. We discussed what we saw in that pattern and turns out we saw the same things, many women were embracing themselves in a protective way. I was baffled by the pattern conditioning pattern and suggestive power of our heads when on self drive. After enjoying the visuals, we decided to go to his place as he had good quality speakers at his place. So we displaced from my place to his.
345	2	a	I had been having temporal alterations at this point. We reached his place and we put on some music. I let him decide the songs as I was still trying to get back control of my mind. After some time, one hour or two, I was starting to get back behind the wheel... the best time in the acid trip. It's when I am still tripping but I can control the trip what so ever. We ate something and talked. 
346	2	a	The one thing that hit me very hard was when he told me 'we are all one, and we are all connected'. I realized this thing by my second LSD trip but he got that in the first. I was really proud of him, and I think I guided his trip successfully while tripping myself, The Tripping Trip Sitter. Anyway we talked about life in general, pondered a little about life and death, what lies beyond this realm. We made up a theory about how people get crazy or deemed crazy. It's like there is an astral plane we can't see, but some people due to some inbuilt reasons or drugs, get into this bad negative or the shattered plane and their brains can't process this much 'disinformation', so they are permanently stuck in this plane and cannot get back to the reality plane. This makes them to be deemed crazy and they live through this living plane while their head is still stuck at that plane.  Another theory I thought about is there might be a higher intelligent being who formed us and made us experience this consciousness, and what makes us humans human, is something that also made us so that we cannot comprehend what lies in that plane that the being exists. And we humans are coded in such a way that there are this 'bugs' in our codes, and those 'bugs' are the things that makes us human, i.e, unique in different ways. But yet we are all the same and have the same form of energy.
347	2	a	In this search for closure and knowledge, I hope I can at least get near to that higher consciousness. I hope my thirst for knowledge doesn't drive me crazy because my journey has only begun. I hope my thirst for knowledge doesn't drive me crazy because my journey has only begun. There are so many things to experience yet, so many things. This ego of our keeps us drifting through this ordered chaos in the same aforementioned way. Stay hungry Stay happy.
348	2	a	Now, this is about 11pm. This was when things took an unexpected turn. My mom had come from work. I came back from work and I was more talkative than usual. Finally while we were having dinner my mom knew something was not usual. I was also sweating. I revealed that I had taken LSD, and parents being parents, that too my mom being a doctor having an orthodox view about these substances and drugs, lost her cool. She became chaotic and we had our infamous 'fight'. I tried my level best to make her explain that I know what I am doing and I didn't take drugs without doing the prior research. But it was in vain. I also cried thinking about death and how it is approaching my grandparents. But finally I calmed her down and she went to sleep. 
349	2	a	I couldn't sleep so I drifted through my thoughts and wandered. In the morning I got myself ready and went to our hospital's new unit's inauguration. I was in an impatient state and to go out in the real normal life while not being so normal, it's hard to keep level-headed. But somehow I made through it. It was ironic that I was on drugs, and I went to a hospital. But finally, somehow, after what seemed like ages I was back home, and I went off to sleep. When I got up I was still my extra conscious, but I was back to normal self, the old patterns and habits started taking hold. Yet in a certain way, every time I trip on LSD, I change parts of myself in a good way. But we have to be really careful with substances like this, as there is only a fine line between the vast unexplored planes of the consciousness. My next trip will be after a long time. Peace to everyone out there and keep spreading knowledge and information.

351	2	a	I am a 21 year old female with very little drug experience. I've smoked pot and hash for 5 years now, and just recently started introducing Shrooms and Acid. This experience is about the second time I had acid, the first time was really not so intense or worth documenting on here, and the second is still fresh in my memory.
352	2	a	The evening began with the intentions to do shrooms and go to an all night drive in with one of my best friends K. K had called her dealer and realized he could only get LSD, so I we decided to get it anyway and see where it took us. We bought 2 hits of Acid and went back to her house with some pot, the film Waking Life, and my paints and canvases. We couldn't make it to the movie so we were having a night in. I took half of my hit at 9:30 and listened to some music, waiting for our other friend to show up. He had a car and was not on anything and wanted to go in to the city to get fast food. We listened to music and waiting for our friend S to show up. It was 10:30 when I took the other hit, and just kind of forgot about it as we went for the drive in to BK.
353	2	a	Like the first time on Acid, everything was positive up until this point. We were laughing about everything and I remember having such a warm fuzzy feeling all over. My face actually hurt from smiling so much. I did start to come down slightly when our friend dropped us off, as we realized it was 1am and we were alone on Acid in her room. We had paints and the movie to distract us. For about 2 hours we played around with the paint and watched the film which was mind blowing, I've seen it many times but never on Acid. 
354	2	a	The reason I am actually writing this experience comes down to the point where my friend fell asleep and I was left there to fall asleep. It was 3am and I was probably at my peak. I tend to worry a lot and have been on meds previously  (I went off paxil 2 years ago) for depression and anxiety. I am a lesbian and have not come out to my parents so I lots of emotional baggage, which I was quite aware could end in a disaster for my trip. The exact opposite of a disaster is what I experienced. I rehearsed what I was going to tell my parents, I worked out problems with my love life, I consoled myself and actually formed some self esteem. I felt like I was someone else viewing my life and reassessing it, I realized that so many problems I thought were so bad actually were quite fixable and small. I cried, I even threw up and saw eyes in my puke. The visuals I had were amazing, I stayed and layed in my friends spare bed from 3am to 9am when a repair man came to fix her water tank, where I fell asleep to the sound of him banging away at metal. I didn't want to fall asleep knowing he was going to show up early, but as soon as he did I was actually soothed by the loud noises. My friend woke up at 11am and had an intense headache which lasted far in to the evening. I think it probably had to do with the fact that she didn't have the brain activity that I did, I'm sure if my brain tried to sleep as it was so fucked up I would have had  a headache too.
355	2	a	I know I will only take half next time I do it, as the visual and nausea was not very pleasureable. I did like the therapeautic affect the LSD had on my mind, It really helped me throught my problems. I know that it is dangerous to use drugs when mentally unstable but sometimes it helps you see your life in a different perspective.

357	2	a	This happened in 2015 on a beautiful day in November (it's 2018 now). I live in a place far up north, so there was plenty of snow. Prior to this I had tripped on LSD once, taken MDMA once and I smoked weed regularly. The one LSD trip I had under my belt had been really frightening and I thought I was going to die, so I was nervous as fuck when the day of my second trip finally arrived. The guy I was going to trip with was a friend that I became friends with at the school we were attending, a school where you sleep, eat food and play music all day for a year. We were both 19 at the time. My friend, who we are going to call V, had tripped on acid twice before and had the best time of his life both times.
358	2	a	So to the day of the trip. It was a sunday morning and I woke up at 9 a.m. and went to have some breakfast. I made myself a huge plate, thinking I wasnt going to eat for the next 10 hours or so. I tried to keep myself calm, but I couldnt get rid of the thought that I was going to have a bad trip, like last time. I sat down beside Vs roommate, too nervous to even say hello. After a while I blurted out a beautiful day, huh?. Vs roommate looked at me and said why the fuck do you care, are you going fucking skiing or something? He had no idea.
359	2	a	After eating I went down to my room and texted V, asking where the hell he was. He said he was almost ready, and would meet me at my room in 10 minutes. That was the worst 10 minutes Ive had in a while. I thought i was going to have a panic attack. And I was sure as shit that there was no way I wasnt going to have a nightmare trip thinking this way. V finally showed up. He didnt give a fuck about breakfast so we went outside right away. As we were walking to the little forest where we were going to drop the blotters, V managed to calm me down a little bit. He also mentioned that his roommate had autism. We found a sweet spot, and V  took out the blotters, handed me one, and I put it under my tongue. The dosage was 150 micrograms. The nervousness came back and once again i thought I was going to have a bad trip. V asked if we should smoke a joint. I declined at first, thinking that that was the cause of my first bad trip. But he lighted it anyway, and I took a few hits. This turned out to be a great decision! After just a few minutes my nervousness faded away, and I was calm again.
360	2	a	After about 30 minutes we decided to go buy a pack of cigarettes. I started to feel the acid creep up on me. After walking for about 10 minutes we turn around a house, and BAM: we see the ocean. It was really beautiful. There was a few pine trees there too, and the way the sun was shining through made it all look like a scene from a movie. I giggled and said to V I think I'm feeling the acid. Then we stood there for a little while, laughing like idiots. 
361	2	a	We arrive at the gas station. I remember it was a funny feeling coming inside. It sort of made the trip more intense. We stood inside for a while, not knowing what to do exactly. We started laughing again, and I began to wonder how fucked up we looked. I suddenly remembered why we were here, so I went up to the desk and said give me a pack of cigarettes. For some reason this was hilarious to me, and I really tried hard not to laugh my ass off. I got the cigarettes and payed, and we walked outside. I felt a little embarassed.
362	2	a	On the way back we walked over a bridge, with a river from the ocean running below. We stopped and my jaw dropped. Some of the river was frozen, and it looked like the ice was moving. As I stared at the ice I could se stars and planets, and it looked beautiful, like the universe. I explained to V what i saw, and he agreed completely. I also stated theres no way in hell that ice isnt moving!. Of course it didnt.
363	2	a	We went back to the school, and I decided to have a shower in my room. This is were the acid peaked. As I was standing in the shower I started to see some weird shit on the shower curtain. I saw a beaver, standing on his hind legs with a crown on his head. I found out he was a king, and that his army was going to war against an evil lion. It was like seeing a movie. Suddenly I came back to myself again, and thought to myself that I was really tripping. I tried to focus on the shower curtain again, and this time I felt like I was in a space ship. I had the feeling that I was racing through space with an enormous speed. It started to feel a little too real, and at one point I thought I saw some aliens behind the shower curtain. I became scared and turned off the shower and layed in bed for a while.
364	2	a	I began watching a movie, but it seemed so fake to me. The only thing I could think of were how much the actors humiliated themself playing such stupid characters in such stupid movies. And how our society glorifies and look up to these clowns. Ive never watched a movie in the same way since.
365	2	a	It was about 5 hours since we took the LSD when V texted me, asking if I wanted to jam. I said yes, so we went over to the building with all the rehearsal rooms. I play guitar, and V got behind the drums and started laying down this really groovy beat. I felt like I was playing like a god, and that we had an almost telepathic connection: every time I began playing a different melody or riff, V got the mood I was going for immediately. I felt like Santana at woodstock, that the guitar was a snake I had to tame. I could really feel the music, and one time we both started playing slower and slower, feeling like time became warped and we entered a different dimension where time didnt go as fast as here on earth. 
366	2	a	After jamming for about an hour, the effects of the LSD really started to diminish. It didnt happen much more worth writing. During the trip, there were times I felt safe and comfortable, and other times I felt really fragile and scared. But at the end I really felt like I had accomplished something, that I hadnt let the fear win. So all in all a good experience, which we repeated a few times, and eventually got kicked out of the school, but thats another story! Hope you enjoyed the read, and stay safe!

368	2	a	LSD (2) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
369	2	a	Last summer, I was 20 years old. My friend and I road-tripped a week down to my other friend, who got us the acid. The three of us dropped together, and kept up such a strong positive vibe the whole time. Since then, I listen to music better. I 'get' it now. Music is the purest expression of the existence each of us manifests, and I had to take LSD to realize how to enjoy that.
370	2	a	It was almost surprising how stereotypical the effects are. Bright kaleidoscopes and sense of oneness. But this really is just the way.

373	2	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
374	2	a	"It was a beautiful day and G, R and I had just bought a strip of Dragon Ball Z acid the previous day. We called it this because or plug only sold LSD on sheets with the DBZ logo. Due to the weather, we decided it would be a perfect day to drop and we each took one tab of 200ug strength. We then drove around the city and pulled endless gbs as we waited for the acid to kick in, (dont drive on acid we are stupid). At about 30mins in I began to feel the familiar warm euphoric glow and I knew I was in for a great trip. Another 30mins had passed and we headed back to G & Rs apartment as it was really starting to kick in for G and R but for me the warmth and euphoria had only grown stronger and I had yet to experience and visual. This was odd as I usually begin to experience visuals early on into the trip.	Overall 2hrs had passes since I had first dropped the feeling of warmth and euphoria was still steadily building and had become so intense that it was almost overwhelming."
375	2	a	"Then suddenly while lying on a couch in the living room I felt a pop and it was as if reality went through a paper shredder and those strips of reality were sucked away into the top right of my vision. Those strips were replaced with complete blackness that eventually gave way to a mystical dimension void of space and time. While I was there I lost everything that I had always perceived as me all I was reduced to pure tranquility and I can vaguely remember vibrant reds, yellows, oranges, and purples. I dont remember much about this place other than this. Im not sure how long I was gone but while I was there it felt like eternity. I returned to reality with a wide grin, G and R asked me what happened and it took me a while to gather my thoughts all I could do was just smile and laugh like and insane man. I eventually gathered my thoughts and told them what had happened. They didnt seem to believe me as they had never experienced anything similar on acid. I believe this to be my first ego death experience. 	"
376	2	a	After I was able to collect myself I walked over to the mirror in the room and stared at myself for a while. At this point I was tripping sack and was curious what would happen. At first I looked normal, slowly, my skin became pale, eventually grey, my eyes turned a deep black, and my hair was moving as if it was alive. This startled me at first as I was not expecting to morph into a foreign being, but although eerie the being standing before me did not appear to be menacing. Since this first experience I have continually perceived myself as an alien looking entity. As the acid began to slowly ware of I saw fractals of lessening intricacy and vividness as I eventually returned to baseline, and was greeted the next day by a lovely afterglow. Sadly, I have yet to experience anything like this since though, I have tried to return on multiple occasions but to no avail.

379	2	a	I dont know why I am posting this, I really feel I have no need to, but at the same time I also feel as if the experience I had must be shared.
380	2	a	I am a semi experienced LSD user, I have done it multiple times, and  it has always been a very enlightening experience.  This time was different, It was not a bad trip, but what I felt was that I had somehow come to an understanding of the world, and that the understanding had somehow slipped away. I dont know how to explain it, so i'll just go over the night.
381	2	a	I took 3 hits of liquid acid on the toungue at about 930PM.  We drove back to my friends house and went inside and began to listen to music and hang out.  I had not spent much time with these people, they were new friends, but they were very nice and they all made me feel very comfortable.  
382	2	a	I began to feel the initial effect about an hour after injesting.   
383	2	a	The sence of anxiety, of knowing whats going to happen.  About 2 hour into the trip, I began to get some very detailed and fascinating open eye visuals, I went into my friends bathroom, and stared at his shower wall, I felt like I was swimming in the sea, no sailing the sea, the acid ship was at my control.
384	2	a	Later we went over to another friends house and I sat and played video games for quite a while, I was really enjoying myself, everything was funny as hell and the video game, super mario cart for gamecube was trippy as fuck.
385	2	a	At about 5 Oclock AM, the effects were still very stong,  but something began to become strange.  I was the only one awake at this point, and I was now just sitting and staring into space and thinking.  And thses thoughts kept coming into my head. As I looked around the room, I see all these people, just passed out from a night of doing drugs and partying, and I looked at myself, and I felt this overwhelming sadness, I felt like nothing more that a junkie, a knew that thats all I was, all I am.  
386	2	a	I went outside, and started at the city and the now lightening sky, and thought about how insignificant I really am in the whole perspective of the world, and an overwhelming sadness came over me.  I then knew that I needed to do something, that I needed to change my life around.
387	2	a	I would have to say that LSD has helped me realize things about myself. The unfortunate thing is that I wish I had realized more, I feel like I missed something big.
388	2	a	LSD is a powerful drug, used wisely, it can do a great deal of good, but it can also be a monster, and destroy.
389	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
390	2	a	I used to do acid whenever I could get my hands on it in high school.  (Generally every weekend).  I loved it and always had a great time for about the first 2 years of doing it.  I never really had strong visuals, but would come to meaningful conclusions about the world and have powerful realizations.  I also enjoyed laughing my ass off at the insanity of the human race.  After a while something changed though.  I began to have bad trip after bad trip.  I would get paranoid and had trouble trusting the people I was with.  I thought that they were laughing at me and staring at me, wondering what was wrong with me.  I also developed anxiety problems.  I'm not sure what changed but I can no longer handle acid anymore and I'm kind of sad about that, but well, there's always mushrooms.

392	2	a	LSD (2) : Not Applicable (38), Addiction & Habituation (10), Bad Trips (6), Retrospective / Summary (11), General (1)
393	2	a	I had done LSD four times before this trip, but the most I had ever taken was two tabs. I had some money and a urge to have a huge trip with one of my best friends, so I bought six tabs. My guy said they were really potent and to be careful with them. I ended up taking three and my friend who had never done acid took one. About an hour and a half later I started feeling really fried and started seeing some of the strongest visuals I have ever felt.
394	2	a	We were at my friend's house smoking some weed when my little brother called me at around 8:00 PM. He sounded worried and said that our dad was supposed to pick him up for basketball practice but wasn't there. I told my brother to walk home and that I'd be there soon to check on my dad. The trip started going bad at this point. My friend and I had to walk through a very sketchy area at night surrounded by crack heads and goons. We were pretty creeped out but we had to see if my dad was okay.
395	2	a	We made it to my house and it turns out my dad had just gotten drunk again. My brother got home and was railing against our alcoholic father for forgetting that he needed to pick my brother up. I started really tripping in the next room and felt really embarrassed. 
396	2	a	My friend went home and I felt like the night was ruined. I was the highest I've ever been in my life and everything was moving and changing colors very rapidly, and I couldn't stop thinking about the problems in my life. I closed my eyes and I started hearing this old Chinese flute music, and all of a sudden I was in this beautiful place full of colorful trees, rolling grass mountains and a river at the center. The river had rocks in the middle and I could hear the water flowing, it was all very detailed and felt real. All of a sudden I felt some type of presence. I looked to my side and I saw a young Bruce Lee. This kind of creeped me out but made me happy at the same time, because Bruce Lee is a huge inspiration to me. Then I started speaking to him.
397	2	a	I said 'Damn, Bruce. My life is all types of messed up. I have an alcoholic dad, we're losing our house soon and my friend just had to see all the shit that just happened.' Then Bruce looked at me in the eyes and then pointed at the river. He said, 'Your life is just like this river. There may be rocks and obstacles in the way, but it keeps on flowing just as you will. You are 17, you will be an adult soon and all will be well.' Immediately after he said that my eyes flew open and it was like a huge realization moment. It calmed me down so much and after that the rest of my trip went very well. 
398	2	a	To this day if I start getting stressed I think of that place and moment and it calms me down greatly. It was the most rich psychedelic experience I've ever had.

400	2	a	LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Families (41), Entities / Beings (37), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
401	2	a	I, Wodin-One-Eye, still believe that LSD offers a unique avenue for Lamarckian human evolution: changing one's own DNA to an improved form. This property is (IMHO) unique to LSD and is not shared with the other major psychedelics. However, the process involves a specific danger: when the first stage is accomplished, which is marked by a cosmic trip of a particular character, a waiting period (which I estimate at one month) is required before taking more LSD. Failure to observe the waiting period (that is, taking more LSD the next day) resulted for this user in a trip to Plastic Fantastic Land, an extremely undesirable result. This is probably the bizarre psychosis mentioned in some of the stuffy and uncomprehending literature written by idiots in white coats. I recount my experience of Plastic Fantastic Land and offer some observations and conclusions. It seems to me most important to warn younger users of the specific mechanism by which I stumbled into Plastic Fantastic Land (where, I assure, I would not desire to go again).
402	2	a	I was a musician from infancy. When in 1974 I discovered that listening to music was enhanced by LSD, I determined to learn to play music on LSD. Over the course of a half-dozen trips in 1975, I was led by Spirit to choose a set and setting of a week alone (November '75) in a remote family cabin on a lake. After several days alone I took 500 micrograms (?+-) on the Thursday, before dawn, some 30 hours after the lunar eclipse (lunar phase, I believe, could be a factor influencing trips) and four weeks before the winter solstice.  
403	2	a	As I sat in the kitchen waiting, the morning sun came over the horizon; across the lake somewhere someone started a bulldozer motor, and the vibration of the sound entered my left big toe and vibrated my body and lifted me to my feet. I grabbed my guitar and rushed outside to sit on the porch in the sun.  My eyes crossed and I entered a complex hallucination in which I heard an orchestra tuning. When the vibration was at maximum, a bee flew from right to left across my field of vision, and my right eye followed it, turning 90 degrees to the left into my nose where it remained. My left eye remained straight ahead looking at the fingerboard. I began to play. In my right eye, a hallucination formed: God, the angels, and all of my male ancestors stood and listened. At my left, I saw my deceased mother being carried down to the lake in her coffin. Also at my left, I heard the Goddess moving (not speaking, not visible). I momentarily broke the spell to look to my right and see if anyone was really there  there wasn't. I snapped back into the hallucinatory space and continued to play for perhaps hours?? and learned a great deal about music which I was able to retain, although it took many years to work out the details. I will not dwell on the many beautiful details of this few hours in Paradise. Toward the end, I got out a music stand and some sheet music. Then a Wind came and blew the sheet music off the stand, and said, Now! I put the music and the guitar away and went out in the sailboat.
404	2	a	The cabin possessed a styrofoam sailboard about 10 feet long. The rudder attachment was broken, and on the day before I had crudely repaired it and taken it out in a mild breeze. Now, the Wind blew, and I took the boat out again. Not a sailor, I did not know to tie a loop in the rope which held the sail (1/4 nylon twine). I held the rudder with right hand and wrapped the rope around my left hand. The Wind took me rapidly out into the lake, sailing against the wind. The rope cut into my hand. It became very difficult to hold on, and so, I quit. I had the thought, I should go practice music some more! I turned the boat around. At this moment, embarrassing to recount, I had a sexual release and wet my pants. I could no longer control the boat, and was blown about for the entire rest of the day by the Wind. At the end of the day, at sunset, the wind died when I was 50 yards from shore near the cabin, and I paddled in. 
405	2	a	The next day, I understood that the Wind had intended to take me somewhere. So, I took another two LSD tabs, same as the day before. But it was pouring rain. I sat in the kitchen and played the blues tripping. Then I thought, this won't do! and I went outside. Suddenly the Wind came back and blew the clouds away  and, bingo, I was in Plastic Fantastic Land (to be described below). I got the boat out again and went out on the lake. The wind and waves were rough and shortly the rudder broke off and the boat capsized. When I righted it, the mast and sail came loose and sank. I paddled to land miles down the shore. I was barefoot, and it took me the rest of the day to walk home on the dirt shore road carrying the boat. During this walk, my head was divided in half: two separate entities inhabiting my brain, and not too happy with each other. My left testicle seemed to be painfully pulling away from my body. I got home at evening and wept. 
406	2	a	Plastic Fantastic Land is attested by two sources known to me: a series of drawings by Robert Crumb published in Zap Comix in the early '70s shows the visual imagery: trapezoidal interlocking acid patterns inhabited by reptilian humanoids, completely hallucinatory and non-living. The state is also accurately described by Marty Balin's Jefferson Airplane song, Plastic Fantastic Lover. Although Balin dodged the question of its meaning when asked, it appears to me that he and his lover had a cosmic trip together, probably making love, decided to take more LSD the next day, and went to Plastic Fantastic Land. It is not a nice or desirable place. My experience matched the elements of these two artistic renderings of PFL, leading me to believe that this has been a common experience, which arises because of this hubris: wanting to have the same trip again, which I now believe to be a serious spiritual error. No matter how cosmic the trip, taking more LSD the next day (although often reported to be useless due to tolerance) after such a cosmic trip, may lead to Plastic Fantastic Land. What it definitely won't do is recapture that cosmic trip. 
407	2	a	In Plastic Fantastic Land, my brain felt divided into two separate entities. In Plastic Fantastic Land, my brain felt divided into two separate entities. This was clearly related to the eye-crossing state of the day before, and to something involving the relation of right- and left-brain via the corpus callosum. In retrospect, I believe that I had on the first day re-organized the structure of both my brain and my chromosomes or DNA. (Cf. Barbara McClintock's work on spontaneous chromosome rearrangement in maize.) However, on the second day, the created structure of the day before was simply melted and destroyed by taking more LSD. It is my belief that I would have consolidated the gains from this experience by waiting for some time (a month or more: maybe a year?) before tripping again, and that I could have built on the experience.  I don't believe that there is any permanent brain damage from PFL that is not recoverable through rest, exercise, good diet and meditation. However, the psychological effect of a visit to Plastic Fantastic Land is devastating, and this is also a challenge to recovery. Sadness at Paradise Lost stayed with me for many years, and I never again was successful in achieving a set and setting that would support another such experience. For months to follow, whenever I smoked cannabis, I flashed back to PFL. 
408	2	a	The following spring, I had an unfortunate experience: severe mercury poisoning. This was unforeseen, and from an unexpected source  I will not say more about this so as not to generate controversy. It was a private tragedy. I was brain-damaged, and lost much musical ability as well as the ability to play chess well, and many other lesser details. My family, needless to say, blamed LSD, as the mercury poisoning was invisible and unrecognized. It took many years to recover, and during this time I also blamed LSD for this sudden dysfunction (which took several months to develop to its maximum), although I was at a loss to explain the mechanism. It took me 40 years to (a) recognize my symptoms as those of mercury poisoning, and to (b) unravel the difference between the effects of LSD and mercury poisoning. This I finally achieved by taking more LSD in my old age, which allowed me to definitively say, LSD did not cause this-and-this particular type of dysfunction. However, I admit that this is a subjective opinion. On the other hand, I believe that hidden mercury poisoning is quite common and may be responsible for some symptoms blamed on drug use. For instance, before that, I never had reefer madness style hallucinations, but afterwards I had them whenever I even smoked cannabis. In the event, I was compelled to stop taking LSD: I entered a yoga ashram and stayed several years. 
409	2	a	After such a cosmic trip, a recovery period is necessary. Good diet (including saturated fat! IMHO!), rest, meditation and hatha yoga appear to be beneficial. Lacking a coherent recovery program at that time, I became a burnout, but this, I believe as stated above, was seriously complicated by mercury poisoning, and the effects of that lasted so many years that I was unable to pursue these questions any further. In sum, I believe that the cosmic trip is an evolutionary opportunity for both the individual and for mankind, but that it involves necessary learning processes for such ignorant young dummies as I was, and that these learning experiences must be repeated in order to learn how to ride that tiger. There was an immediate pitfall which I fell headlong into, which was not to sensibly wait before taking more LSD. If one could avoid that dumb trap, it might be possible to build on a series of learning experiences and find out what Spirit really wants to offer us. I have also taken, later in my life, mushrooms and ayahuasca, and I find no hint that they offer the same unique DNA-shaking and DNA-changing trip that LSD did on that occasion, but then, neither do they lead to Plastic Fantastic Land, making them much safer. I also consider it highly probable that some of what I experienced with LSD may have had to do with stage-specific brain developments in late adolescence, which no longer occur or can no longer be stimulated in older people such as I am now.

412	2	a	As always, my LSD sojourns into visionary experiences receiving so much praise by others evaded me.  In the past, absurdity itself dogged my mind/body interpretation of all sorts of experiments that gave others what was expected, from Budweiser to Slivovitz, from Leper Weed to Ecstasy.  Even so,  I was surprised by the unexpected skull crushing sensations on my first LSD trial and the writhing during later trials into floor positions with muscles graced with astonishing energy.   Soon, I learned from Dr. Grof himself, that the alarming skull pressures ascending from the roof of my mouth, moving into the maxilla, climbing across my nasal bone and shearing my forehead in opposite directions was a birth memory of one born by Twilight Sleep, an obstetric procedure abandoned thirty years after I was born.  My initial resistance to this interpretation finally gave way to the unmistakable correlation between the LSD memory and what the fetus would feel as the doctors first two fingers drag the baby out of the birth canal by the roof of its mouth, producing obvious distortions of the skull in the expected sequence.  This was a real memory, it was resurrected by a very small dose (25ug) of LSD and it happened only once, disappearing totally after several days of exact encores in the form of flashbacks.    
413	2	a	Later trials with higher doses (100-250ug) of the same street lot of LSD produced effects of an entirely different kind, in which a two-minute spike of heart rate, blood pressure and oral temperature was followed by several cycles of twisting into fetal positions with intense flexing of all skeletal muscles.  
414	2	a	A glorious change came over me in the following two or three days, in which I was highly aware of my surroundings, as if they were new.  This was accompanied by a new state of relaxed movement without any sign of fatigue, reminiscent of the ease in which a lion or leopard walks, confident in ability.   More LSD trials produced the same stages of LSD effect and I reached unaccustomed levels of ability in sports activities.  This blissful state would not occur unless I fully participated in the muscular work during each session. This blissful state would not occur unless I fully participated in the muscular work during each session. 
415	2	a	What does one make of this?  To a biochemist, the idea that a tiny amount of drug just sufficient to cover the head of a straight pin would elicit an unforgettable nine-hour trip was, to say the least, impressive.  The temptation to account for the birth memory and for the struggles in later trials was irresistible.  A hallucinogen started a process to open a memory site for release of its contents into conscious awareness after >four decades of hiding.

417	2	a	I smoked a couple bowls before I headed over to my friend's dorm room at about noon. When I got there, I already knew I was going to drop three tabs of acid. This was extremely stupid given how strong the tabs were and that it was only fourth time on the substance. I remember taking them and my friend taking one.
418	2	a	I knew of the spiritual and mind-changing possibilities if LSD but hadn't truly broken into an ego-death experience I was about to have. The real reason I was taking the acid that day was not one someone should be taking a dose of acid like that for. I was taking it to have fun and 'trip balls' for shits and giggles. I don't remember it kicking it in and don't remember being aware of existing in reality until a little after four PM. During this time, all I can reoccur is seeing photon-light particles of all colors, way more colors than exist not on LSD, fanning out in every direction from what I later figured to be the Big Bang. As I was drifting in and out of even being in the present moment of reality, there was this kid in the dorm-room who was sober and thought it would be keen to mess with me, at least I thought.
419	2	a	I couldn't recollect anything I knew about anything and everything I knew about real life seemed like it was fake and a far-off concept. I would remember things like my name and where I was, that I was a physical object and existed with everyone else and take those thoughts as grand realizations. A pattern started to arise in my statements, 'But when'? All of time, and I mean infinity, every phenomenon that has happened or will ever happen was happening right then. I then connected the Big Bang I had envisioned earlier that day and thought I was experiencing a separate Universe, an entire Big Bang sequence that I would ride to expansion and come back the next day. As the day wore on and we were hanging out with people, they started noticing I wasn't talking much. This is because I was deep in the halls of introspection and participating socially wasn't really on the docket. By around midnight I was still tripping nutsack.
420	2	a	I ordered an Uber home and watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and then 'Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia' until the morning. The issue was that I had dosed almost 24 hours ago. I had work at noon. I was still disoriented and definitely mildly in the trip. Time took forever to go on at work. And paranoia took over. I thought for sure I was permatripping and I was trying to figure out a way to tell my family I needed to be checked into the mental hospital. I held it together on the surface the whole time, but I was extremely confused at work and was seeing things differently, I could smell a distinct smell that I figured was the trip. When I went home, I still couldn't go to sleep. I smoked and that had my thoughts racing even faster. The last I could remember was thinking about how I now had to live with Schizophrenia and how to deal with my psychosis.
421	2	a	After over 30 hours tripping I had finally passed out. I woke up once and was still a bit confused. I wasn't tripping when I woke up again but the paranoid thoughts are very consuming. The second time I woke up it was with the sunrise and I knew the trip had worn away. I turned on Pink Floyd's 'Time' and cried with urgency and gratefulness.

424	2	a	Three friends and I decided to go bush and take what had been described as very strong clean LSD-25.  Prior to taking it I did about an hour of awareness meditation.
425	2	a	The LSD took about half an hour to come on.  I sat watching the river for a while and became immersed before going out to the old growth forest to watch the trees.  I had never seen this before - they were pulsing and bulging in and out and I could see green auras around them.  I became aware of my primate side, the side that knows instinctively how to connect to the earth - the side that knows how to survive if everything fell apart tommorrow.  Funnily enough it made a lot more sense when I had all four limbs on the ground like an ape.  I definitely had a better connection with the earth when my hands which I know so well were literally connected to the earth.
426	2	a	About 2 hours into the trip I saw what I can only describe as dna sigils interweaving themselves along my arms and hands.  They flowed along perfectly with the contours of my normal physical body.  I also saw slightly different sigils on the face of my girl friend.  These visuals were constant for about 4 more hours.
427	2	a	The visual state and my mental state seemed to be in unison during this time and the feeling was as if I was connected to the earth not as an ape as before, but as a human, but a human who could move and live on the earth in a way that I have never done before.  My posture and presence actually felt different - like another being - but it was definitely me, just me in a way that was unified with the earth.  There was something childlike, but there was also adult and animal, and throughout it all I was aware of the choice to be what I want to be.
428	2	a	I have a fair amount of experience with LSD but have never experienced anything quite like this.

431	2	a	I used to live on the Gulf Coast in Mississippi, and psychedelics are seldom available save shrooms.   I had tried shrooms before eating several ounces, but my results were lackluster. I did not know what to expect, and was taking them for the notoriety of having taken them more than the experience. When I first encountered LSD it was unlike anything I had ever run across. When you hear about something called acid you would expect it to melt your brain, but it does not, not in a literal sense anyway.  A friend of a friend had come back from the Bonnaroo music festival with window pane acid and was selling it for cheap so I bought some. I had tried acid before and was amazed at the superficial visuals and the sounds that seemed to come out of nowhere, but after awhile I began to consider myself a professional tripper.
432	2	a	I began to delve into what made it tick, and why if the drug was so strong in small amounts, why it made any difference at all if I took one more than everyone else (Which I did for bragging rights, I pushed myself even further than everyone else, durdur!).  Started to wonder where the time went, and what I was left to, where I went when  I was away.  In the height of this particular trip on the window panes I found myself in deep contemplation while I watched Robin Williams on Broadway. The things he said did not seem as funny as they did true. Why was everyone always blabbering on about Atomic weapons?  Because they were afraid of them, but why should they be afraid of them if no one will ever use them again? They should not. I found myself sorting through my fears, encountering repressed thoughts ( child abuse and the like), and looking at my friends as human beings instead of these fabricated dolls I had created in my head. I realized how accountable I had been for every action I had ever taken, and how much of my life was up to me. Before this moment I do not think I had really been conscious of my freewill. I dont think I had ever thought or felt anything genuine. Then I realized something potentially life shattering , this was not the drug, but my mind playing tricks and running in circles. I began to consider what life would be like seeing it from this perspective all the time, and I asked myself if I wanted to go back to living in that stupor or continue to feel this way forever. The friends who I was watching the program with realized something was wrong with me so I suggested that we go outside for some fresh air, and so that we could smoke some cigarettes ( because we were so fucking cool).
433	2	a	Outside beneath a large I told them of my revelationthat the drug was not real. They were not surprised. One of them told me he had figured that out several months before, and another aid that he had speculated that to be the case, but that he was not quite ready to believe something like that yet. Then there was a third friend who asked me if I wanted more acid, then he asked me if I wanted to travel to bourbon street, and all kinds of other weird things like that. I told him no each time, but he persisted as if he had not heard anything I had said. It got to the point where I felt like reaching across and punching him, but then I had another idea. Me hitting him was exactly what he was trying to get me to do. I decided to forgive him for his absurdity rather than giving into some animalistic urge. Then he broke down and cried. He told us that his Mustang meant he was cool, and then he asked us if we thought he was cool too? We went along and told him that we did. He cried more and ran through a list of things that made him think he was cool. Finally I decided I would like to go for a walk and stretch my legs in this new world I had discovered. The friend who was not ready to accept stayed with the one who would not, and the two of us began walking down a long road toward some water at the end of my street.
434	2	a	I told him that I wanted to tell other people about the way I felt. Told him that I had been living in bullshit for so long, and now everything made sense. He began to tell me about Christianity, which I was familiar with, but I had long been agnostic. The trip had not changed my agnosticism. It just made me think that I had been tripping on life, and now I was tripping on death. I had made up my mind to stop tripping period by this point. That was until he began to tell me how Christ had died for my sins and all these bible stories. He said after his BIG TRIP ( the one like I was having) the Bible helped him keep his sanity. I thought that he had felt alone after his trip, and the Bible gave him something absurd he could cling onto, but my newfound innocence got the best of me. I began to believe him about God ,Jesus, and Christianity. For months afterward I claimed that what I had experienced was salvation. My soul had been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ! People noticed a drastic change in me.
435	2	a	I had been selling pounds of pot just days before, and now I was striving to be a good Christian. It was not me, and as things do that are not, my religion eventually faded, and I found myself in a greater darkness than I had ever encountered. I felt that my friend had unknowingly betrayed me. Religion had kept him from feeling alone with the universe, but throughout my life that was all I was ever looking for. That feeling made me feel whole, and now because of this implantation of Southern Baptist doctrine I was lost again.cut off from myself in every sense. Tabula Rasa, a blank slate. Now two years later Ive managed to put myself back together not as much as I would like nowhere near as I ha that night, Substance abuse has re entered my life, though I do not find myself placing the faith in the substances as I did before. LSD on the whole has never brought me that close to something again.

438	2	a	Obviously there are a million things to be said right now but what I want to talk about it the effects of yoga after having tripped pretty hard for about an hour (which included a bus ride home) I came home.  My mom is a yoga teacher and my basement is half childs playroom half yoga studio.  I asked her if we could do some yoga, I blamed it on being stiff and tight but I soon learned that muscle and your body are all finite ideas.  Anyways we go down to the studio.  All of the lights are off except for the mood lighting.  There was chill music.  What really hit me about the yoga was feeling inside my own body.  All that bullshit yoga teachers always say stuff like 'pinch your shoulderblades back and feel your spine melting' I actually feel it and the ways that the yoga teacher describe things to me make perfect sense.  Things that dont make sense to me normally like 'lengthen your spine' make sense and I can feel it.

440	2	a	I remember wanting to have sex on lsd to see what effects it would have on me and the visuals. So me and my bf has sex and everything seemed normal visually. However, sensually was a different story I could feel everything, every bump, graze and glide. The colour around started to get brighter and move faster and as my orgasm built up so did the visuals. The colours became more vivid and the shapes became more structured and fixed together. Like a perfect puzzle. The closer my orgasm came to be the more shapes would appear and colours that I didnt even know existed tarted showing up around me. And I shit you not at the climax it was like a firework display going off around me. Each shape exploded into what looked like pixie dust, it was all so bright and overwhelming tbh. It took me a while to come back around. I sat there for ages just gazing at the ceiling understanding what had just happened.

443	2	a	I suffer from cluster headaches. It had started about 3 weeks prior to the trip. My friend had brought over some acid so I figures why not. Note that I didnt even know this was even possibly a cure for the headaches. Therefore there could be no placebo effect. Anyway, I started the trip and noticed the usual effects. I noticed that about 1/4 of the way along, my headaches which were quite severe that day, had completely gone away. I was astonished to feel better. Never would I think that this is a cure for anything, but it helped tremendously. The good thing is that since that day, I havent gotten any sort of cluster headaches since. Thanx cid!

446	2	a	I had a pretty traumatic experience with acid about 3 weeks prior to writing this. I had tried LSD once before that but it must have been weak or bunk because I didnt feel much. Anyways, the setting was my friends house, just me and him. I took 1 tab at first, and then another an hour later.
447	2	a	The effects of the first tab were just setting in: I was feeling detached from reality and giggly. At about an hour and a half after taking the first tab, I started getting this feeling of intense anxiety. The feeling got worse so I went to sit under his deck and calm down. I thought looking at the trees and nature would help me out. The anxiety became more and more intense as I sat in the chair and I felt completely helpless. I became paralyzed by a feeling of fear. It wasn't about anything in specific but I felt very afraid and anxious. I became paralyzed by a feeling of fear. It wasn't about anything in specific but I felt very afraid and anxious. I had some very intense visual distortions as I looked at the trees. At about 3 or 4 hours after taking the first tab, I started getting hallucinations. I saw a monkey dancing in a tree and a cartoonish type of coyote smoking a cigarette next to me. They were only in my periphery though and would disappear when I tried looking at them. I was paralyzed in this one chair by the feelings for about 5 hours. I couldn't bring my self to get up. I wasn't scared by the hallucinations though. If anything, they distracted me from the overwhelming emotions. I wasn't scared by the hallucinations though. If anything, they distracted me from the overwhelming emotions. When the trip died down at about 5 1/2 hours, I was left with the anxiety. I didn't think much of it at the time, I thought it would wear off.
448	2	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
449	2	a	I then went inside to take some bong hits and then drove home. When I got home, I couldnt sleep at all that night. I was so anxious and begining to feel extremely depressed and thought I was loosing my mind. For the next few days I experienced intense anxiety constantly. Prior to this experience, I had never experienced anything close to this level of anxiety. I experienced a vivid flashback several weeks later where I felt like I was tripping again. The intense part lasted only a few minutes but I had a detached kind of feeling for aboout an hour.

461	2	a	The first time I tripped was with 3 of my close friends and we all took one hit. This particular blotter acid was a (spider-man) and, obviously had a little picture of the face of spider-man on it. This was a wonderful experience and I felt a sense of closeness to my friends, and it was during the day, cause we had skipped school, and the sky was so big, BLUE, and beautiful. We walked through the woods for a hour just looking at plants and picking flowers and buds off different plants and bushes; I felt a real respect for the beauty and naturalness of nature. Then we came up on a railroad track, and it just so happened that a train came by at that time, and it was loud as hell. And I could feel the ground shaking.  But this isn't the bad experience.
462	2	a	The second time I tripped I really messed up. It was a week later from the previous first trip of my life, and I had gotten 3 of these (spider-mans), and from what I had heard from experienced trippers was that these spider-mans were good, and I agreed considering my first trip. I bought 3, one for me, my best friend who I hadn't tripped with and his brother. We had planned to do it on a saturday night. Unfortunately, my parents had planned to go to a nascar race early the nest morning and I had to be there real early at like 5am,so I could watch my little sister. SO I was at home alone, cause my parents were in bed sleeping, and my friend corey and his brother had decided to go to a club since we weren't tripping. I stayed up late that night watching t.v. Cause I was bored and at 12 started to watch 'Space Cowboys', and I was bored and wanted to have some fun and took one spider-man, after and hour into the movie I felt as if it wasn't really effecting me, and being a unexperienced user of acid; not knowing the power of it; and still questing for that true trip, like in the movies and stuff where u have alot of visuals. So wanting more effect I took the other 2. So now I have 3 spider-mans in me and I'm watching 'space Cowboys', I first started to notice that Clint Eastwood's face looked real weird and sort of twisted, and in the movie they're working on this satellite in outer space that is supposedly this Russian communication satellite. But in the movie its a conspiracy, and the satellite is actually this nuclear warhead satellite still up in space from the cold war. Now when this things goes into attack mode, I felt like I was in a dam I-max theatre, and this thing was giant, and I was like ok I'm tripping now, so I turn it off and go to my computer and start to play a computer game called Counter-Strike, but I find myself just staring off into the screen and like breaking down every pixel on the monitor, so return to the television but only to flip through the channels, and note this was only my second time tripping and the first time I didn't have any real visuals, but this time I was in for some.
463	2	a	I turn on the T.v. And start to watch ESPN and they have a male aerobics contest. Except I cant hear the announcers no matter how hard I concentrate, I never knew acid could effect the hearing. The contestants are jumping around on stage, moving real fast, but he scary part was all their heads were shaping into demons, and they were growling, so I flip to ESPN2, this one is sportscenter, and as they were showing the highlights all the games were in total slow motion to me, no matter how hard I tried it wouldn't stop moving in slow motion, and then I flip to HBO where they were playing 'Lake Placid', the one with the giant killer crocdile, and the peoples' faces kept shifting, and there skin would peel back off their face into another shape, and I saw some scary scenes that I can't really remember, but now at this point I have this deep dark fear, and not being able to handle it  I decide to try to fight it and just goto bed, so I go upstairs and lie in my bed, I remember just lieing there playing with my hands, and looking at feet which seemed to be a mile away at the end of the bed, I felt a fear that I wouldn't come out of it cause I had taken too much and remember thinking that over and over that I was going to go into a permanent trip, and when my parents got up to get ready for the race I was still tripping lieing in my bed tense and frozen like a stiff dead person trying to pretend I was asleep as my mom came in to my room to say by, but she skipped across the room; and I couldn't even understand the words she said, and as she left I thought about how much I loved her and how mad she would be if she knew of the stupid shit that I do, and my little sister came in and layed with me after my parents left and this was like 7 in the morn, and she noticed that I was wide awake, and she asked me what was wrong and I just began to cry and told her she would never understand, then I got up at took a shower, when I got out I felt so cold and body felt like crap so I layed in bed again, and just went into a daze and I don't know if I fell asleep or not but at like 11am I came to my senses, and got up and was delighted to notice that I wasn't tripping anymore, and my eyes weren't dialated and I could actually think. I swore that I would never trip again, but I have many times since then, but nothing ever close to that night.

465	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Alone (16)
466	2	a	Before my first trip I had experimented with many drugs. I felt like I had explored the vastness of my mind to the extreme. While having many a high time, I had given up on drugs having the ability to take me to new realities. Shortly before my trip my life was in chaos. I was gaining weight, jobless, self indulgent, and utterly wasteful. My mindset was that of a curious 15 year old, yet I was 21. So this being my reality, a close friend procured some blotter.
467	2	a	I took the hit with an open mind. within an hour my friend and I felt as if we were reading each others minds. Barely having to conjure up words to express emotions. The sensation was all mental with an intense body buss. Soon however, I was in the grips of my own inner demons. My fears and thoughts were out on display for me. I realized how pathetic and immature I had been. Careless and selfish, disgusting. I changed forever that night. I realized I was a man, I had a healthy body and spirit within begging me to allow it to thrive and glow. Begging me to become a man. since this experience my life in general has improved a great deal. I exist in a new, enlightened reality. The trip is over, but just like a trip to the Grand Canyon, it's greatness will always be a memory within me. If I loose faith, I remind my self how strong I am. I believe this experience has probably been shared by many people, We are united through this...we understand.

469	2	a	LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Glowing Experiences (4), General (1)
470	2	a	It was a Monday evening after school when my buddies G and N told me that they just got word from our dealer that he's got 
471	2	a	A great deal on some Storm-trooper acid tabs. My buddies and I were all experienced trippers (so I thought). I tripped around 8 times, N around 10 and G about 7. This time I wanted to take 3 I've only taken 2 at most in the past which I thought was the 
472	2	a	Perfect dose, but N said I should at least just experience 3 one time, so I did. My buddies and I drove up to meet our guy to get the tabs, I got my 3, N his 2 and G his 2. I wanted to wait and trip with my other buddies D and A on the weekend coming up but it was a Thursday morning when I ended up staying home 'sick' I thought it would be the perfect time.
473	2	a	On that Thursday morning I made a dumb decision, I popped the 3 in with a positive but also slightly nervous feeling. I sat on my computer reading through some articles about news and listening to music, 25 minutes in I felt it, I realized then what I was 
474	2	a	In for. It was 6:35 a.m when I took the tabs. Once I really started feeling it I decided to relax in bed and watch the new X-MenDays of Future Past, and boy was that something...the color's were unbelievable, the feelings were amazing this in my head.
475	2	a	Was the coolest experience I've ever had. After the movie was done I got up and just starred out my window looking at the sky, the trees, my pool, the cars passing behind my house. I was astonished by everything I was seeing, and a weird thought
476	2	a	popped into my head. I thought about some of the people I knew and how they had to grind for what they have. I know people who have barely anything with crazy screwed up lives...no parents, no money, barely a roof over their head, but me? Well I had everything my parents were still together, I had money, I had a roof over my head, I was spoiled. All those thoughts just clicked in my head and I started bawling my eyes out harder than I ever had before because I treated my parents like sh*t even though they did everything for me and I realized how lucky I was. All those thoughts just clicked in my head and I started bawling my eyes out harder than I ever had before because I treated my parents like sh*t even though they did everything for me and I realized how lucky I was. This was the life changing part in my trip because after this, I treated my parents with so much more respect and rarely ever talked back to them...they had no idea that LSD was the change to that.
477	2	a	Now on to where my trip went from excellent to terrible in the matter of seconds...it was 7 hours into my trip, I was texting my buddy D and telling him about it, he then replies with 'Bro, how are you still tripping that hard? You should've reached your peak by now?' After reading that text I thought for some reason my brain was fried for the rest of my life, I thought I would be tripping forever...And even though in the middle of the trip I knew that it was just the Acid I couldn't control it...I was freaking out. I lost my mind, I would go from my bed, to my computer chair, to walking back and fourth repeating my name...address...middle name just to keep myself from thinking I'm crazy...At that point I just wanted to talk to someone, I NEEDED someone. My brother, and dad were home BUT I knew if I were to say a word to them they would think I'm crazy, and to me at the time I thought I would just stay in my perpetual loop and end up in a mental institution. It was finally 2:45 p.m when D got home I made him get on skype to talk and help me. D would ask me questions and I couldn't even respond or barely comprehend what he said...I kept trying to explain what was happening but I couldn't even remember anything...my train of thought was obliterated. Eventually I realized I was stuck in my first acid loop that I remembered reading about. D looked it up and just told me that I had to relax. After a little over an hour my mind was once again stable. After that experience I've never touched drugs again.

479	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Bad Trips (6), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Alone (16)
480	2	a	During the Winter of 2005 I came across some good quality LSD.  I had only tripped on the substance twice before, but I am very experienced with other hallucinogens.  LSD is tough to come by in Northern Virginia where I live, at least with the few connections I have.  So I purchased 8 hits and took 2 the weekend before to test it out.  I tripped a little bit and got a lot of morphing and coloration changes, but no visuals, leaving me a little disappointed.  The LSD was relatively cheap so I had planned to go into school to take a test and then go home sick right after and chomp down all six of my remaining tabs.
481	2	a	I woke up excited next morning, eager to begin my trip.  It had just begun to sprinkle snowflakes on this beautiful Virginian morning.  I arrived to take my test at 8:00 AM sharp.  I brought the LSD with me and had decided that I wanted to be tripping when I got back home, so 15 minutes into my 45 minute examination, I ate my tabs.
482	2	a	T 0:00 - At precisely 8:15 AM, I ate all six tabs, then hurried to finish my test.
483	2	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
484	2	a	T 0:30 - By the time I finished my test I was coming up strong.  I handed in my test, and scurried out of school.  It was strange leaving, the patterns on the floor began morphing.  I decided to walk into the bathroom to check myself and take a piss before hitting the road.  My pupils were very dilated and I had the appearance of someone high on drugs.  It was still snowing when I got out to my car, so I hopped in, popped some good tunes in my CD player, I think it was United States of America, good stuff, and proceeded to make the 30 minute drive home.
485	2	a	T 0:45-1:30 - The snow has lightly dusted the grounds on the highway that I travel on and the wind is blowing the snow around, giving the road the appearance as though the ground was moving.  Also, I would like to clear one thing up.  The trees are covered with snow, which reminded me of Narnia.  I felt blissful and tranquil, eager to get home and rip out my bong.
486	2	a	T 1:30-2:30 - I arrive at my house and greet my dog, a shaggy, black-haired dog who is always around me.  He has smoked with me on a lot of occasions and I believe he enjoys the habit.  Whenever I arrive home from school, I always take him outside and rip a bowl before my mom gets home.  He sits right beside me and looks up at me, eager to get a shotgun.  It is now snowing very hard, and I look outside to see that my car is completely covered, so I decide to take my bong out and box it up.  My dog is terrified of the snow, so he wouldn't come along.  I enter my car and put in some Grateful Dead to back my trip.  I proceed to smoke at least an eighth of pot, and by the time I exit my vehicle I am tripping exceedingly well.  I decide that it's such a nice day, so I should go for a walk.  I grab my iPod and go walk around my neighborhood, which is a truly gorgeous piece of land, with tall trees, nice houses, and woods surrounding it.  I walk around for about thirty minutes but decide to go back inside cause I was cold.
487	2	a	T 2:30-3:30 - There is a hill beside my house that is pretty steep that has since been developed on, but ever winter my brother and I make a ramp at the top of it and jumps at the bottom.  The ramp is solely used to collect speed.  I grab my snowboard and go out and mess around for a little while, though I am physically inept at this point and can't land a thing.  I walk back inside and make a few cocktails and watch a movie, the Doors.
488	2	a	T 3:30-5:30 - I'm still tripping delighfully hard.  My own trip experience completely correlated with the movie, which I only realized until after the movie.  I'll admit it, I am an alcoholic, so I found many parallels between me and Oliver Stone's inaccurate portrayal of Jim Morrison.  I was tripping almost at my peak when the band goes out into the desert to do acid.  As I am making more and more drinks and getting a little drunk, Morrison breaks away from his band and starts doing cocaine and drinking to excess, just as I am now doing.  By the end of the movie I'm still tripping, but not nearly as hard as before.
489	2	a	T 5:30-7:00 - I go to smoke a few more bowls to try and get back up.  It works surprisingly well.  I decide to make a fire cause it was getting chilly in my humble abode.  As I look into the fire, I see tremendous colors, brilliant and vibrant colors, colors that I didn't know existed.  The flame turns solid gold and I am absolutely enthralled by the whole experience.  I watch a little while longer then retreat to my room to play guitar.
490	2	a	T 7:00-12:00 - My trip comes to a close in these hours.  All in all it was a great experience, that lead to the creation of my new motto when it comes to hallucinogens: trip hard or don't trip at all.
491	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
492	2	a	This was my first real experience with LSD. I acquired a strip of geltabs from a strange man I came across. I have had much experience tripping with Dxm, Mushrooms, Salvia, Ketamine, Morphine etc... I knew that I was mentally prepared for whatever may come during this experience. 
493	2	a	It was about 11 p.m. on a saturday night, I had just finished a long work week and had the next day with no responsibilities. I broke 3 pieces off the strip and put them on my toungue until they dissolved. About an hour later I joined my crew. They were all excited about going on a journey.
494	2	a	I started tripping around 12 a.m. I couldn't stop petting this dog that had a mane and resembled a lion. The next thing I knew we were following these strange people we met to a place they called the 'Land of Moses'. 
495	2	a	We arrived at the Land of Moses around 2 a.m. It turned out to be a graveyard in the middle of Nowhere Indiana. By now I was tripping very intensely. There was a strange woman guiding us the whole way. Her name was Carrie. We walked throughout the graveyard and made it to a giant statue of a man holding a sword. Carrie spoke of the Statue never facing the same direction. We watched as the lights around it flickered violently. Some sort of electrical Fury. I could feel an intense energy that defied any other trip I'd ever had. Soon Carrie's stories had my girlfriend so scared that she was in tears. The look in Carrie's eyes was so mesmerizing. She looked like she was on LSD as well, but I knew that she was not. She spoke of possessions and figures in the graveyard. Several of the people with us saw something walking in the distance and became frightened. The energy was so strong. 
496	2	a	The next thing I saw was the peak of my life. A dream I had previously had kept flashing through my mind. Deja Vu was so strong. I grabbed my girl and held her as close as I could and felt her heart touch mine. At that very moment and train ran by less then 30 yards away from us. It was so bright and loud. I knew that this was the highest peak I'd ever reached. Complete chaos. The train was running by, so bright. Every star in the sky swirling, tree branches moving like life-like limbs. Utter insanity. I cannot describe my emotion.
497	2	a	Soon the train passed and Carrie led us to a bridge. We parked on it, and I realized that it was 3 a.m. There were 3 cars parked here, each containing 3 people. Carrie spoke of 3 being the death hour. This did not frighten me. I felt like something had just been tapped into. Some kind of peak that's so hard to explain. 
498	2	a	Minutes passed and Carrie parted ways with us, She gave us directions back to old Fort Wayne (home), and we were on our way. I spent the rest of the trip in complete awe, just absorbing the memory of that moment when the train ran by. This was definitely the highest experience of my life.

500	2	a	This trip happened at a huge music festival. This was my first time that I tripped really hard and it was overall a very positive experience. My and one of my friends took 2.5 hits at about 1 PM. We sat around and talked for about a half hour, and when we both started to feel some initial effects come on we started walking to the festival area. We decided to split up from the rest of our friends that were with us so we could be free to go off and adventure without being tied down to a big group. 
501	2	a	By the time we got to the festival area we were both starting to feel very upbeat and giggly. After walking all the way there we sat in the grass near one of the stages and waited for the show to start while we checked out the schedule and planned our day. We cracked some jokes and were laughing really hard. When the show started, we went up to the front. The band was awesome and it felt great to move to the music. 
502	2	a	After a few songs, we figured it would be a good idea to go see one of the crazy side-shows going on at one of the tents. By the time we got there we were starting to trip pretty hard. We sat down in the tent and waited for the show to start. We had a really interesting conversation with someone near us about how crazy the whole festival experience is. I felt like I was speaking really profoundly and me and my friend were both cracking up. There were decorative chandeliers hanging from the tent that seemed to sway back and forth. The show began and it was immediately very visually appealing. The opening act had 3 women dancing in golden clothing and they were waving around golden cloth that seemed to shimmer. The colors, lights, and music were all very vivid and spectacular. 
503	2	a	We left before the show ended and we both felt like wandering around and just watching all the people around. It felt amazing to walk and my legs felt a little rubbery. I noticed I was sweating and the water felt very strange on my skin, and I loved how slippery it felt on my forehead and between my fingers. I couldnt hold back a huge smile from my face! We started talking to some drunk girls at one point and we were both laughing because they had no idea what we were experiencing. Conversation was difficult and required a lot of thought, but I felt I could still get a point across normally with some added effort. I felt like I could walk forever. We ended up going all the way to the main stage and caught a couple songs from the band there. 
504	2	a	As we walked to another stage to go to a show that was starting soon, we randomly ran into the rest of our friends. When we saw them, they looked very different to me and it was very surreal. We talked a little bit with our other friends, but conversation was becoming more and more difficult. I felt like I wanted to talk with my friend who was tripping about what we were both experiencing, but it became more and more difficult to put things into words. My reality was starting to fall apart a little bit and I noticed that all of my normal judgments about things were suspended and I could think about them in a different way.
505	2	a	It was liberating and confusing at the same time because I was starting to realize the complete subjective-ness of all experience and my brain had nothing to grasp as solid ground. This is an extremely difficult feeling to put into words, and it really opened my mind to different possibilities and ways of thinking. I also thought about how awesome and free the whole music festival scene is, with so many people into so many different kind of things, all having radically different subjective experiences and mindsets. It made me realize how true it is that there is no objectivity when it comes to human experience and behavior. I realized how deep down were all so different from each other, and that its not only just o.k. to do your own thing but its also amazing!
506	2	a	We walked over to another concert nearby and arrived right on time. The band started to play, and after a minute I realized they werent playing any real songs and were just improvising. They were really gelling and were playing some very spacy, atonal music. I was hearing how they kept subtly surprising each other and exploring different tonal areas seemlessly. If I focused my attention, I could hear great intricacy in the way they played every note. We left after about 30 minutes to go catch another show. We sat down towards the back and had a conversation with this really bubbly, free-spirited girl who I think was also tripping on something. Her voice was very calming and I enjoyed the conversation, though speech was still difficult. After she left, I laid down in the grass and stared up at the sky. I was getting very intense visuals looking at the clouds and they appeared to swirl around and I could see waves go across the sky along with the music. I told my friend to do the same and offered him my sunglasses. We laughed about the common experience and how it made absolutely no sense to our logical brains but nonetheless it was very real in our minds. This was a strange duality to me of being completely out of my mind, but yet still present, collected, and completely able to communicate!
507	2	a	After that concert ended, we walked along a trail that goes through a small forest with really cool looking trees. There was a man doing sound therapy for donations there and we laid down nearby to take some time to recharge a little. The sound of the gongs he was using were calming and I felt deeply at peace. Laying down in the woods and staring up at the trees swaying in the woods was blissful. I wanted to stay there forever, but my friend wanted to go see the next concert and we had to leave. 
508	2	a	We went up to the very front at the concert and found our other friends who were there. It was very crowded and I felt uncomfortable. Shortly after, the concert started and I was really enjoying the music for the first few songs. One of my friends sparked up a joint and passed it to me. I was feeling really good still and I figured it would be a good idea to hit it, but I turned out to be way wrong. The next song the band played was a very heavy, aggressive song, and it freaked me out a little bit and I started to feel bad vibes. After the song, the band started smoking a blunt on stage, and then threw it into the crowd near me, and one of my friends caught it. Instantly, it was a frenzy for everyone around to get a hit off of it, and I just felt caught in a vortex of bad vibes. My friends all passed it around our own circle and smoked most of it before passing it to anyone else around us (which I thought was a huge dick move). I passed on it, not wanting anything to do with it. At that point, I just wanted to get out of there, but it was so crowded that I was pretty trapped. I couldnt get into the music after that, and my mind was getting very negative. I was pissed that I had smoked and that it was giving me a bad trip. Thats when I had a huge revelation that I dont even like smoking anymore, even though Ive smoked regularly for years, often daily. I realized that it has always just brought me down more than anything, making me paranoid, self-conscious, and lazy. This was a very liberating discovery to me, and felt like a weight off of my back, even though I was still not having a good time. 
509	2	a	I was so glad when the concert was over, even though it was a band I normally like. My friends couldnt stop talking about how amazing the show was, and I was having a hard time explaining exactly why I didnt enjoy it. I was able to put it behind me, though, and I enjoyed the rest of the day. It started to get dark and there were now brilliantly colored lights all over the place to check out.
510	2	a	I was no longer peaking but definitely still feeling effects. We went back to our campsite later and I had a blast just improvising on my guitar. I felt like I played more rhythmically and creatively than I ever have, which was cool. I started playing the rhythm guitar part for Dark Star and jammed on it with one of my friends and it was a blast. All in all, it was a really great trip and I felt like I benefited from being able to see the world through a different lens for a day. I was able to more objectively look at my life and my personality, and I feel that was of great value. I feel like there is so much more that I could write about it, but its so hard to put that type of experience to words.  I think music festivals are perfect settings for doing acid I look forward to doing it again some time down the road.

512	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Festival / Lg. Crowd (24)
513	2	a	I remember the first time this happened to me. It was a night of madness. We all ate the acid inside the house and waited for it to kick in. then we continued smoking marijuana like crazy, as we were doing before, the whole afternoon, and drinking beer, hanging out.
514	2	a	Man, it was the strongest trip everyone had ever had. As I was the most drug hungry, I took twice more than them. It was sometime at night already, and we were being very noisy with the music playing really loud and everyone screaming to talk to each other. The new sensations and thoughts we becoming more apparent and we perceived quickly that something was changing. We were all going mad. At some point I forgot I had taken the drug.
515	2	a	I went to the kitchen and became fascinated by Portuguese tiles on the wall! Oh my, were they beautiful! Patterns of interlocking rings of the most vivid blue, each one slowly turning, clockwise and counter-clockwise. My resting right hand melted against my forehead, and the Pink Floyd album playing on the background was my only reality. What are these weird and exquisitely beautiful noises?! I didn't even remember who they were, or that there was any way out of that sound. And that was just the first wave.
516	2	a	After that, my friend asked me to roll us a joint and I couldn't really recognize his face, only stare at it. It was so beautiful and expressive! Midway rolling the joint, I caught myself wondering where did that green thing come from and what was it for and why they were so eagerly waiting for it. I couldn't finish the joint and handed it away to my friend.
517	2	a	I felt the whole house we were in was alive. Everything breathed.  I had no concept of me. I had no idea who I was. I tried at some point to hang on to the memories or places or duties that were familiar to me, whatever I thought would made me, me, because I was terrified. All in vain. I was gone.
518	2	a	When we all went out the backyard to have the smoke, one of my friends commented that soon it would be the break of dawn. Only then, I realized time was split into daylight time and nighttime. I didn't even remember that! Then, my friend handed me some bread and I just stared at it. He said: Eat it! Do you know how to do it?! Haha! I got a kick from it, because indeed I had forgot we human beings eat! And that reminded me that we are all animals.
519	2	a	So much had been experienced that I was getting exhausted of everything and was wondering a way out of that. All that existence. I thought, Maybe if I sleep, Ill be able to rest from all this... But then I realized theres no way out. Sleeping wouldn't satiate my need. I needed a break from existence.
520	2	a	Then we heard the cops siren! Everyone went crazy. We all started running nonsense and they shouted from the outside: Stop right there! Man, that was the rush of my life! So I froze right there at the corridor, totally frozen, and waited. One of my friends went up the stairs and saw through the balcony a police car and two cops arresting a shirtless man on the street. On our street. He came back and told everybody it was going to be okay, that they werent raiding the house and we wouldnt go to jail or get killed.
521	2	a	After that, we chilled a bit, and I came down very fast. The sun shone and two of my friends went to the bake house and bought us all some orange juice and freshly baked bread for breakfast.
522	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
523	2	a	Over the past three years I have experimented with various drugs but only delved into the world of acid this year. 
524	2	a	My first ever experience with acid was fairly tame as I think the tab was not very potent but I felt very euphoric and had good visuals. 
525	2	a	It wasn't until my second acid trip that I truly felt the power of this crazy paper magic. I dropped the tab with two friends around 7pm summer time so it was still going to be light for several hours however I anticipated that I would want to stay inside so we chilled in my friend's bedroom. Almost as soon as the effects kicked in around 30 minutes later I felt an immediate need to go outside. Only one of my friends wanted to join me so we went for a walk and this was absolutely amazing. Everything danced and formed patterns, I felt elated and mesmerised by all the colours I could see over everything and the earth looked as though it was breathing. 
526	2	a	Things stayed pleasant and amazing for a while until we returned home. My friend's house is filled wit ornaments, toys and crazy wallpaper which all wriggled and changed colours. Being inside at this point was very overwhelming and I had to leave again. We all went outside and things started to get weird. I slowly began forgetting who I was, where I lived, what I do in life, what me and my friends were doing and I was obsessed with knowing where we going even when we had chosen to sit and relax. 
527	2	a	I forgot I was on acid, I felt like the same people kept passing us as we sat on a park bench and I struggled to see if things were really close or really far away. I knew something was weird but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I felt like I was in some dreamy state, I couldn't talk and I couldn't really get my head around what other people were saying. I could understand each individual word but the whole sentence sounded like jibberish. 
528	2	a	It was actually quite stressful and overwhelming until I finally remembered we were on a drug It was actually quite stressful and overwhelming until I finally remembered we were on a drug and that this crazy weird feeling would stop and suddenly my trip returned to being blissfully happy and entertaining. 
529	2	a	As I started coming down I took a second tab and went home. In my room, I listened to music and laid in the dark with my eyes closed enjoying the closed-eye visuals but annoyingly I fell asleep about 3 hours later. I don't really know how, I just suddenly woke up in the morning and felt like I had wasted the tab as I barely reached the second peak!
530	2	a	I have done acid a few times since but have yet to experience any spiritual awakening or reach any great epiphanies which was my main goal in doing acid but I think I will try two tabs in the future. 
531	2	a	From my experiences, bad trips are easy to trigger but equally easy to avoid and easy and easy to turn around. I think I just needed to do it a couple times to be able to know what to expect and how to control a seemingly out of control experience! 
532	2	a	I am planning on doing LSA Morning Glory seeds soon for a second time and LSD in the near future.

534	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Retrospective / Summary (11), Various (28)
535	2	a	This experience happened about 4 months ago. I had only tripped on LSD twice, both times around 2 tabs worth, so I was still pretty inexperienced with psychedelics at the time. My roommate on the other hand has dropped dozens of times with absurd amounts. I believe the most he took at one time was around 1400ug. I'll refer to him as M. We both got a little more than we were asking for.
536	2	a	It was a Monday night at my home and my roommate had picked up some LSD tabs from a pretty reliable source. He cut roughly 3/4 of a tab and tested it with a reagent kit to ensure it was legitimate, and then ate it. He asked if I wanted a tab, and I said no at first as it was a Monday night and I had classes the next day. After about 20 minutes, I thought about it again and decided to take it, since I wasn't sure when the next time I was going to have an opportunity to drop again. 
537	2	a	Both me and my roommate sat in the living room waiting for the come-up. Maybe 20 minutes after taking the tab, M looks at me and says I've never tripped so hard in my life!. At first I thought he was joking. He hadn't even taken a full tab, and I assumed it probably lost a lot of potency with the reagent kit. He then goes into his room, and I turn on the song Echoes by Pink Floyd. At some point during the song, I started getting extremely intense visuals. The wrinkles in my jeans suddenly turned into a wavy ocean. I was both amazed by how a substance could do something like that, but also fucking terrified. I only had gotten tracers and some mild movement on my 2 previous acid trips. The music was able to keep me calm for a while, as it is my favorite song of all time. If you've ever heard echoes, you'd know that it gets extremely dark right in the middle for about 4 minutes. This is when things started to get really crazy. The whole room went dark and began changing shapes; the walls were warping and I started trying to hold on to anything that I could use as a reference to real life.
538	2	a	I eventually had enough intellect to turn the song off. I eventually had enough intellect to turn the song off. At that point the vibe became a lot brighter, but not any less intense. I eventually went to my roommate's room hoping that some company would help me keep some sort of grip on reality, but it really didn't help at all. Every time I looked at him, I saw dozens of rainbow fractal versions of his face, but they weren't really visual. It's almost like I was halfway in my head dreaming about this, but still seeing it at the same time. 
539	2	a	I then lost touch with reality completely. I have no idea how far in the trip this occurred, as I had the thought process of a 2 year old at that point. If I wanted to fly to another part of the room, I could do it. I would be lying on the couch, but in my mind it was an extremely vivid feeling of flying to the other part of the room. My thoughts and imagination were differentiable. I honestly thought I permanently went insane. 
540	2	a	I started to finally get a grip on reality again after some time. I started remembering things from my physics class, and I knew that laws of physics can only exist in the physical world. At first, I lifted my hand up and let gravity take it down. I slowly started to establish what was real and what wasn't real. I started feeling the couch, recognizing that it was a physical thing and not something I made up in my head. This went on for a while until I was completely grounded again. I still had intense visuals, such as seeing shifting in brick walls and objects warping, and this actually went on through the next day. M said the same thing as well.
541	2	a	I've tripped multiple times after this, with my highest dose being ~350ug, and that trip didn't even come close to the intensity of this one. I asked other people that had taken the same batch, and they all had similar experiences from just 1 tab. Moral of the story- don't underestimate 1 tab. It could be VERY overlaid.

543	2	a	LSD (2) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)
544	2	a	I took my 175ug tab at 10:15 pm. I was sitting on a chair on the back porch surrounded by my old pals that I hadn't seen in months. I let the tab sit under my tongue and swallow it after about 15 minutes. I thought swallowing the tab could decrease the intensity if this were a dose I couldn't handle. (I was probably wrong but I felt safer this way). 
545	2	a	I just sit and watch my bud play DJ hero and have some laughs. After about 35 minutes I find myself on the ground mesmerized by the carpet. I notice the fabric move around almost like worms (take with a grain of salt). 
546	2	a	Now I'm an hour in, and I head outside for a cigarette. I'm starting to come to terms with how the chemical feels. I lay on the ground with music on and watch the stars slightly fall before me. I head inside and just chill while they watch videos and smoke dabs. Though I know trip sitters should be sober, I made this exception, seeing as I too had taken just 2 small dabs. The feeling now was almost strictly bodily, like I was completely sunk into my comfy chair. I make small talk with my close friend's brother. I have one more smoke and head into my friends basement at 3am. 
547	2	a	I get behind his piano and fiddle around, really try to get my pent up music energy out. At this point I understand this 'at home' feeling I've read about. Every other moment feels welcoming, like a new perspective has brought me warm hospitality. Now close to 4am I lay on the couch in my friends basement while he rest on the couch a few feet away. I put on some of my favorite music including bedroom pop like Starry Cat and some Explosions In The Sky. Visually, I found myself lost in the album covers on the tv screen. It was like one still frame was a whole psychedelic masterpiece. if I notice a certain pattern, it tends to be repeated and repeated. I can somewhat control where my visuals take me. 
548	2	a	I learned a lot of information on acid. Lots of answers to questions without thinking too hard, answers seem to roll off my head. Like art. Art was one of the most important realizations during this trip. I realized that life was created somehow, just as art is, simply created, making universal consciousness art itself. I realize that the mind is the most sincere form of art. 
549	2	a	Another effect from the trip was out of control bodily movements. I lay on the couch for hours letting my mind shut off the best it can and my arm moves high across my cold face. I tend to be moving and rubbing my clothes a lot. This movement keeps me grounded throughout the duration of my experience. This lead me to become connected to the universal pulse that moves within us, in our hearts. The music playing from the TV definitely amplified this 'pulse' idea. For awhile I trick myself into thinking if I wasn't moving I'd have bad thoughts, though this subsides.  Other visual aspects included staring at the little specs and glares on the sink and having them completely cover my visual field. On the couch I trace and draw on the fabric for over an hour, with the light from the TV shading the room, while crib mobiles hang from the ceiling. 
550	2	a	The hours that followed were somewhat zombie-like. I presumed this to be the 'comedown'.  I woke up my friend to ask if I could go watch the sun rise on his back porch. The screen doors were left open so I was welcomed with fresh air and a chilly temperature. I wander around viewing the rising sun and just explore around in his backyard. I head back inside and wrap a big blanket around me on the couch. I let the hours pass as I feel a bit burned out and sweaty, fairly aware of my altered mindset. I concluded that Acid can really hurt my brain if I try to gain control, it's like my conscious will try to push Lucy out of the driver's seat and it will disturb her greatly. Every time I thought 'I'm on acid right now?! I didn't really need to do this did I!?' I'd feel a pinch in my brain and readjust myself.
551	2	a	This substance is made for people who can easily watch life go by without worrying or putting in maximum conscious effort. I see now why meditation is an important skill to have. Overall this was a pleasant and somewhat enlightening experience. Though the comedown the day after is difficult to overcome. Still slight feelings of disconnection and numbness but definitely a more open mind and a better acceptance of my outer and inner universe; especially now after puffing some grass. 
552	2	a	I plan on using this substance only few times in my life, because now I'm aware of the beneficial yet overwhelming at times chemical.
553	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
554	2	a	It was time again. Every couple of years Tom felt, he would tell his closest friends, 'acid calling'. Wondering whether these intuitions were the product of self-hypnosis/delusion or just some cultural hippie norm he had picked up subconsciously, he got into the car with with two of his traveling companions to drive a few hundred miles to a contact of theirs. Being of the persuasion, that there are essentially two kinds of acid, the acid approaching purity produced with a lot of care and the mediocre nonsense that he had found to be of less worth than the piece of cardboard it had been dropped onto, he didn't care as to whether this belief was factually true or not. He just found that procuring a bottle of Acid  in an alcohol solution from a specific contact was 'appropriate in effect' for the circle he found himself experimenting with in that time. Better in subjective experience than the blotters and sugar cubes even after an expert had maintained 'acid is acid, man... it either works or it doesn't'. It was a pilgrimage to procure the bottle, with battles and problems that had to be confronted or laid aside along the whole route: traffic jams, stormy weather, route changes and adjustments as well as no place to stay at their destination. All this trouble and stress to procure a little bottle of madness juice.
555	2	a	On the journey back home the three of them had decided to visit a botanical garden that was displaying a rare carnivorous plant in bloom. As Julia was a plant person, this stop was mandatory and the botanical garden was rewarding and what Andy liked to call 'authentifying'. At the entrance however, the group was told that the flower had just fallen. The bloom lasting only around two to three days, the plant's flower had finally given way to gravity about an hour before the arrival of the returning pilgrims. 'It's clear what happened here... the acid did that' was Andy's response 'It dissolves everything, even this monster flower at a distance, so when we approached with the bottle...'. The day was one of those breezy summer days and the botanical park around the greenhouses was filled with strong old trees; the kind that have character and beards of moss that are softer than mattresses when they aren't too wet or too dry. The place was relaxed, beautiful, and quiet enough to tolerate a session on the part of this group and so a toast was made to the security guards; their ability to stay out of sight was a skill that the so-called guardians, protectors and police people of our society could learn from. Tom hoped that no 'hooligan druggies' would ever find this place to necessitate more security and trash cans and coke machines and fast food stalls and that kind of what he considered to be consumerist crap spoiling nature's performance.
556	2	a	Only 20 minutes after a glass of Mango juice with 2 drops out of the bottle, Tom found himself wrestling with the day's first issue. In his late twenties, a part of himself had always thought his career would pick-up sooner and was hurting him. An impatience was brewing inside of him with all the compromises he had made and all the concessions his art had to suffer in the process. Instead of studying music and working for diplomas in teaching, he felt he should've just went for it and become a full time singer-songwriter. He blamed himself for being a typical hypocrite coward to walk the 'safe route'. Then the mp3 player jumped to his Playlist with songs by Charles Ives for piano and voice. The turning point in this episode was remembering that Ives had actually become an insurance executive instead of trying to live of his music. The reason for this was simple: Ives didn't want to be in a situation wherein he was forced to sell his baskets. Instead, he made money in business and bought his own freedom along with helping many young composers feed themselves and live. When he was free in this sense, he was able to write the most original, experimental, and courageously beautiful songs. He was not the bitch of any audience or crowd and he didn't have to accept pay from idiots that knew less about music than children know intuitively. 
557	2	a	Beauty to Ives was not simply prettiness, sweetness, darkness, coolness or any other limiting aesthetic criteria and it certainly could not be adequately grasped by language. But most of all it was something that we don't really know. 
558	2	a	Tom had always felt jealous about not being popular enough or people not recognizing his passion and had thought that success in a commercial and career sense was something admirable and something absent from his life. Acid on that particular day changed that negative emotion. Instead of successful singer-songwriters and famous bands and musicians deemed to be excellent, he saw a bunch of empty idol worship. After all, Pavlovian research had shown 100 years ago that all that is needed to like a song is repetition and 'getting used to it'. People can be hypnotized to like any crap as long as you repeat it often enough; just look at how people vote or believe the news that they see on the net or on TV. The problem here to Tom is overly reductive thinking: when people reduce themselves to liking certain styles, or genres and keep rationalizing that with 'everybody's taste is different, you can't argue about taste' and that 'this music/band is part of my personality' they deceive themselves in that they think they know what it is they want or seek. At this very moment, Tom felt, a person goes blind. What they perceive to be openness for a style, an artwork, a book, or a music is inversely the closed-mindedness towards everything else. A truer openness is constantly shifting, probing, fluid, and at the same time strong, with integrity. An open aesthetic person makes bad aesthetic judgments and adjusts accordingly. Beauty and truth not as some formula that you know and that is part of your style; but as a wild animal that requires a lot of chasing after, a lot of seeking, a lot of questioning, purifying and readjusting of your methods and strategies. 
559	2	a	For the first time in a long time, Tom felt happy about choosing the Ivesian route or at least he believed his own lie without cynicism. Hollywood and signed bands are for the masses to which he said goodbye and spoke a chant ending in something like: 'I love you guys, but I know better than to open my mouth when you don't want to listen and for this reason my stage, music, creativity is reserved for my loved ones. There is nothing I want nor care to prove to strangers.' To Tom, in his delusional intoxicated state, the mango juice had removed a huge weight and with his mischievous grin he said he was gonna make some serious cash and become as fucked-up as everybody else. His next toast went to Ives.

561	2	a	LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Music Discussion (22), General (1)
562	2	a	"	The way someone would most likely describe me would be Hippy. Good, bad, I take is for what it is. I love the Earth, animals, and the sense of deeper and subconscious learning. Ive had past substance experience with (approximately): "
563	2	a	Mushrooms 25+ times ; Ecstasy 10-12 times ; LSD 8-10 times ; Extensive pharm experience ; Habitual Marijuana use over the last 3 years ; Ether for a few weeks;
564	2	a	GHB 3 times ; DXM 20+ times ; Cocaine 6 or 7 times  ; Salvia twice ; Diphenhydramine once ; 2C-(B or E) ; Morning Glory ; DMT: a resin rip with subtle effects.
565	2	a	Looking for something as inconsistent as LSD can be a deterring factor in the continuation of the search, But when the storm is right and the road to psychedelic enlightenment is paved, you have Bliss and a babys head.
566	2	a	"	Yeah man I have a friend who can get that, its ridiculously pure though, so its gonna be $15 a hit. Oh I see, How about if I buy 10? Same thing ..."
567	2	a	After debating, I figured I trusted the kid enough for him to deliver on his word, and after all acid is quite the commodity. After the usual long waiting and anticipation of pre-trip, my friend called, setting a meeting place where we could pick this wonderful magic up.
568	2	a	"	At last, a baggy filled with 10 Sweetarts that set me back 150 big ones. Oh well, I was excited. Before I go into each trip/experience I always give myself a few minutes to reflect on what the upcoming event could hold in store for me, and try to induce mental clarity. At around 10:30pm I ingested the first piece of candy along with 4 other friends. Slightly metallic taste, hoping it was stronger than its taste had suggested. I still felt confident. "
569	2	a	"	I noticed the first effects about 30-45 minutes in, nothing profound or too extreme, just mild color distortion and a slightly fuzzy head. Driving, looking for a place to burn some trees the acid was coming on nicely. Before departing from the car to partake in the sweet embrace of Mary Jane, we each take a second hit. Its about 12:00."
570	2	a	Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 
571	2	a	"	On the walk down the dirt path to one of our favorite smoking spots Im struck dead in awe staring at the moon. Watching it as it slowly descends toward the mountains only to watch ascend once more. I pointed out the moon to my friends, and there we all are, stopped dead in our tracks staring. The moon had finally reached all the way to the mountains creating an epic lunar show, where the moonlight would reflect off the mountains in a series of bright patterns. We continued to stare in disbelief of this cosmic event until the moon had completely disappeared behind the mountains."
572	2	a	"	We had eventually made it to the bench to smoke. After we did everything of less-than-bright quality had temporarily gone from my vision. Seeing only an array of streetlights and stars. We got back into the car (not sure the intent of this was, if any) We were driving, bumping music, late at night, on Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, in Utah nonetheless, yet there was this sense that nothing could go wrong, like I was protected from harm and any other terrible event that could befall on me, other than my own psyche I guess. While in the passenger seat of my friends car, I had let out a loud gasp of terror as I clutch my mouth in horror. And pointed at this terrible thing as it lay in the road. Landon (the driver) exclaimed  You saw it to?! "
573	2	a	"	I couldnt speak, I was at a total loss for words. My friend had just seen the same morbid, disturbing image I had seen, without knowing that I had even seen it. All I did was nod my head. "
574	2	a	"	It was like hed ripped the words from my mouth. As we approached this decapitated infants head, it had turned back into what its true form had been, a brown lunch-bag twisted at the opening to create a spherical bottom with grease stains down the sides, looking like bloodied hair. Such an elaborate trick my mind had played on my vision, it was too real for such a awful image. What I took out of this, is that the immensity and realty of this substance can create structures in the worlds beyond infinity. Its power should not be taking lightly. It is a sacrament."
575	2	a	"	To the park was our destination. Swings! What an idea! Back and forth I go with my face cocked towards the stars zoned out to Floyd(as with most of the night) with a grin bigger than the Cheshire cat. "
576	2	a	"	At a different park (not sure why), my brother comes to buy a sack from my buddy. He comes over talks to me for a bit. Leaves, then I hear him calling back at me with a sort of excitement in his tone. He runs back over to show me some pictures of some newly budding plants hed been working on. I must of got the excitement from his vibes. I immediately have this huge smile on my face as he explains his photos. I could feel the light from the phone on my skin, and it was as though the light being reflected on me was exuding from my every pore. With a body high of nothing I have ever felt. "
577	2	a	"	We continued on up into the wilderness section of this park late at night. I remember the lure of a wheat field, I had to go spin in circles with my arms stretched out from my sides, brushing my fingertips against the many plants. My friends got a good chuckle out of this, but it just felt too right not to! "
578	2	a	"	Reaching higher and higher in the park we settle near an old bench. Staring out at the skyline, just staring. And it happened. The line that separated the foliage from the sky and all the colors switched on me. It was almost as if things had gone into Negative vision. "
579	2	a	"	Still zoning to Floyd, I take a seat on the bench just beginning The Wall. My eyes are closed with my forehead resting on the edge of the table. The Thin Ice comes on the child crying gives me a little scare, and I pop open my eyes as result. Not 2 feet from my face underneath the bench, this hideous child with eyes wide as saucers is staring at me while simultaneously I hear it crying through my headphones. It was there as plain as day. My heart stopped. It was too real not to be."
580	2	a	"	The night continues on at the same park, and in a wide field we all notice a giant pole sticking up from the ground. We all look in wonder, until one of us starts running over to it, with the rest following close behind. Turns out it was a telephone pole (Go figure!). I was barefoot during this whole ordeal (Hippy nature I suppose) as well as most of all last summer. I felt this soothing, soft, almost perfect scratch against my feet. I would pick up handfuls of this sand I was standing on, and just let it slowly drain from my hands. During this repetitive action the thought kept running through my head of there being as many planets in this existence as there are grains of sand on this Earth. Staggering realization when you feel like you can actually put somewhat of a tab on the possibility. "
581	2	a	"	It had become early(5-6am) and the LSD was subsiding. Mostly now was the left-over self-reflection period where youre usually are making a lot of conclusions about life and trying to interpret what you had just seen. The bridge back to reality. "
582	2	a	"	We had watched the Lunar light show of the moon dropping behind the mountains, and now here we were watching her counterpart, the sun, bring light and life to the world around us. I had seen the cosmic systems workings for a night. Absolutely stunning. Truly the work of design."
583	2	a	"	We had made our way over to a Harmons(?). I had made the comment while looking at a bushel of roses, that it would be considered quite peculiar for me to go and start smelling all these different flowers. The thought invoked the action, and there I am at 7am smelling the flowers out in front of a grocery store."
584	2	a	"	 It sounds really(10x) corny, but we all need to stop and smell the roses every once in while, and truly take in what has been given to us in this beautiful (mess of a) world."
585	2	a	We cannot grasp existence because we have no means to describe it.
586	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
587	2	a	This was the second and possibly last time i took LSD. I say this because i dont think any other Psychedelic or drug related experiencene could ever top this one.
588	2	a	Me and a few close friends went too an illegal rave in a castle in december, the people there were completely alternative, there where no idiots there trying to sell coke or anything. Obviously there were some insane people there, combining alll sorts of things and getting wasted to the point of no returjn, but there always is.
589	2	a	This wasnt a flaw tho. This njust enhanced the experience for me, it was incredible. WE got there early and had a few drinks, and i brought some salvia and pipe which made a few friends to start with! a couple of my mates took mdma fairly early so me and a few other mates went hunting for acid. Of course i now knpow what people mean when they say that You dont find LSD, LSD finds you. This all seemed alot like someone who had spent too much time on LSD, but it makes sense now.
590	2	a	If you look for it i imagine you'll find it in an uncomfortable place to take it, but if you wait and go somewhere like this, it'll be readily available. Me and my friend took too drops of liquid, which we were told was very weak (we later realised that there is no such thing)
591	2	a	This didnt kick in immediatly so we wwent for another drop which we bought for £5. The trip began slowly, and we had a bit of fun. There were typical wall pulses and things, and we had a dance to the awesome psy trance that they were playing. At about 10 o'clock the organisers of the rave brought us a suger cube laced with the stuff, which i was reluctant to take at first, cos i didnt wanna push it. but once my friends had taken it, i felt i wanted to be on the same level as they were.
592	2	a	It was strange at first becaus eit was my mates first experience with psychedelics, or any other drugs for that matter, and i felt i had the responcibility to look after her. So i sat with her in our dorm for alot of the time, talking and walking around, it was perfect, she was fine and we both said alot of things that we needed to say, i was happy here. This was what i wanted from my trip, to really sort out my head cos i was in a bad way with alcoholism, and acid alwys gives you the thinking you need to tackle your problems in the non-psychedelic realm. And it helped her i think too. We bonded that night, we went around the castle grounds and got frightened, inspired, wiser and became better friends for going through this together.
593	2	a	Id taken acid before, but a much lower dose. Which is why i thought i was at my peek at this point,i was wrong :)
594	2	a	When it really began to kick in, it became a little uncomfortable but still, there wasnt enough time to be frightened of this experience, your mind was working too quickly, there was too much to take in at the time. AT the highest point of the trip we went for a dance in the bottom room where they played the harder psychedelic stuff, and this is where i had the most perfect moment:
595	2	a	After dancing for a while i began some sort of ego death, in which i was omnipresent in this room full of otheres who were on the same level as i was, there was no predjudice, just an unconditional brotherhood amongst these people i didnt even speak too, these people id never met, iy was perfect. I felt out of control of myself, and that we were all one in control of eah other. Ive heard of people seeing god on acid, but i felt like i was god. It was perfect.
596	2	a	After this i went to the ambient room, and sat and watched the drapes hanging from the ceiling, covered in paper butterflies which moved there wings gently to the music, it was a perfect moment. The dimensions of the room where beyond comprehension, there was a girl near me juggling or something, my memory betrays me, but it was the most beautiful thing.
597	2	a	We then went back to the dorm, because my mdma taking friends were coming down hard, and so we all sat in the dark listening to pink floyd dark side of the moon. I had some great closed eye visuals here, the visuals just played around the song and held relevancy in them, one part i remember was watching rainbow dollar and pound signs fly by me as the song 'Money' was playing. It was fantastic. Another point i remember was listening to my friends in the bed furthest from me (They are a couple) giggling and laughing with each other, only to realise that it was just the drum beat of the song, and tha id interpreted that in my head that it was the two of them chatting. It just reminded me of how powerfully mind bending LSD is.
598	2	a	I know, this is just another typical trip report, but for me it was perfect. And i conclude that having a bad trip is impossible if you can just find the right place and do it with the right people. And make sure your in the right frame of mind else it could go wrong. But its also an important experience in life, to realise that there are other dimensions that your senses cannot comprehend withot lsd and psychedelics. lsd illegal? The world would be a better place if it wwas compulsary.

600	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Rave / Dance Event (18)
601	2	a	"	We took off at 7pm on a Friday evening. There was me, and the other members of the Explorers Club, that is S, J, and L. We began our night in my apartment, where our non-partaking roommates had deserted, understanding that there would possibly be four deranged individuals doing the Acid Drugs- probably imagining us shooting pure LSD into our carotid arteries and trying to jump out windows or cut off our hands. Nothing of the sort happened of course, because this is real life, and not an episode of Dragnet."
602	2	a	"	Anyway, Hearing that this was good shit, I had decided to start with one and a half hits,with the other members taking either more or less, depending on their confidence in their ability to hold themselves together. I had attempted to make our setting as pleasant as possible- colored lightbulbs, blacklights, cool artwork, Pink Floyd and Flaming Lips records were prepared. There was also a music visualizer playing on the TV, and we had some bubble-blowing toys and some colored tissue paper to play with."
603	2	a	"	After a while of letting our tabs soak sublingually, and without noticing any strong effects, I was not hesitant about taking another half a hit, taking me now to two hits."
604	2	a	"	Started to feel like something was beginning, so we tore up the colored tissue paper into confetti, and started throwing it at the air conditioner, which would blow it up into the air in a messy Easter-colored tornado. We were beginning to feel that slight squirmy electric feeling crawling all over our beings, when the outside roommates made their way in. They drank some water, and stared on in horror as they saw four young adults writhing around in colored paper shreds on the floor, quoting spongebob, blowing bubbles, and handing them gifts of small fabric pot leaves. "
605	2	a	"	After they left, we began questioning why we dont always play with confetti. Why dont we always blow bubbles? Or jump in piles of leaves? ... An idea took hold..."
606	2	a	"	Soon, we were out in the cold October night, standing in piles of leaves, which was most satisfactory."
607	2	a	"	Later, we were up on an elevated platform on top of some buildings on our campus. We had gone there expecting to see lights from the buildings pulsating, geometric patterns in the dark sky, and the platform itself stretch out for miles as it had on our previous trips. This trip, it was doing none of those things. I began to wonder if we were even tripping at all. There was just a sense of childish playfulness, not a cosmic awakening as I was half-expecting (again, based off of prior experiments). "
608	2	a	Im afraid I might have left the strip out too long- the sun might have diminished its potency, I said.
609	2	a	I dont know... this is kind of nice, like, I dont know, said L.
610	2	a	J said nothing, but chewed on a blade of grass for quite some time.
611	2	a	I have an idea. Lets go back to the apartment, take another half a hit each, drink a lot of orange juice, and smoke a lot of pot. We wanted to get high tonight, so lets try to get as high as we can
612	2	a	"	We cut up the remaining two tabs, and took them with some Sunny D rip-off swill that declared itself 100% Vitamin C. (this brought me now to two and a half hits)"
613	2	a	Flavor be damned I thought, Its those vitamins that will do us good.
614	2	a	"	So we all took our seats in the bathroom, and pulled out our bong, The Space-Time Continuum and proceeded to smoke the most I have ever seen anyone smoke in my entire life. I took no less than seven full rips before we ran out. The room was lit green, and we had some incense burning, as well as The Flaming Lips At War with the Mystics playing from an iPod dock. By the time Free Radicals came around, I noticed that in the dark parts of the room, there was color that should not have been there. My mind was projecting imaginary but brilliantly colored lines radiating outwards form the edges of objects in the dark. The ambient psychedelic music blended well, and for a few brief moments, the room seemed to turn into a rainforest, trees beyond my field of vision, exotic animals lurking, and everything gaining a layer of warm tropical moisture."
615	2	a	"	I have no idea how long we spent in there, but at some point we walked out, and sat on the couches of the living room. It was difficult to understand what sort of state we were in. It was like I would change from feeling entirely sober, to really high, to tripping, to tripping and high, then back to sober again."
616	2	a	What am I right now? We all seemed to be thinking.
617	2	a	And almost as though it heard us, it was like at that moment the acid said:
618	2	a	 You want to know? You want to know what two and a half hits of acid and an uncountable amount of bong rips is like? Well, here you go, shithead. This is what you bargained for.
619	2	a	"	I thought about it a little, then looked at the kitchen. I made my observations and promptly screamed:"
620	2	a	"	LOOK AT THAT SIDE OF THE ROOM! LOOK AT THAT SIDE OF THE ROOM! Yes! We are tripping! Holy Shit!"
621	2	a	      I had never been this far gone in my life before, and it was a little unnerving to say the least. The vibrations seemed to be turning on me, I thought. The pink lightbulb cast forth eerie shadows from oddly undulating cabinetry in the kitchen, where i sat, perched precariously on a leaning barstool, spending years slathering Nutella on a slice of one dollar white bread. Though I was not necessarily hungry (Lucy had seen to that), there were certain food rituals I have become accustomed to (thanks to Mary). And perhaps I was just looking for some sort of way to come to terms with and feel some level of control over this insane world which had never made its presence know to me before, at least not to this magnitude. This was especially difficult when I found myself wondering the ulterior motives of my non-partaking roommates: are they doing something in secrecy? Is this some sort of jealous and perverse attempt at a one-upping? All of this was made worse when Joe began circling the room, dressed nearly all in black, and his  mirrored trip glasses reflecting the green glow of LED Halloween decorative Spider-lights, gave him the appearance of a vulture. The spirit of judgement! I thought, And of death!, My mind recoiled in fear as I smeared another layer of chocolate-hazelnut spread on my mattress-sized sandwich. I thought, this is LSD. You do NOT fuck around with LSD. Who the fuck do you think you are, taking two and a half hits of this stuff and not expecting THIS to happen? You might have been fucking around before, but were not fucking around now.
622	2	a	"	Things were really wild. Flat images seemed to be made of a series of floating layers, some of which moved ever so subtly. All objects had some sort of sound, and I was pretty certain I could hear electricity flowing through the strands of electric lights. Time was gone. Logic was gone. Proportion was gone. Distance was gone. No objects were set in place, and they could freely change size if they needed to, and sometimes things would breathe. Faces and animals were appearing in the pile of confetti, and I felt it was my artistic duty to make the image of a squid eating pink and blue things from these paper shreds. "
623	2	a	"	Even though we as a group could not scrape together much more than the sentiment of What are we doing? we had decided to take a second exodus outside. Which may or may not have been a good idea- J was headed in a downward spiral. He had fallen very quiet, and I had noticed that he had put his right hand on his face, and had not moved it for perhaps an hour (and he would not move it for the rest of the night). On our long and confusing journey, he would often ask us to slow down, or remark that he was unable to get a hold on which dimension his existence was in. We couldnt help, seeing as the only thing we could say was What are we doing?"
624	2	a	"	So we returned to our apartment again, and sat amidst the now wrinkled and sad confetti bits with our minds absolutely blown to bits. My mind was a blank slate, and I couldn't think of a damn thing to say. But  this whole trip was like a metaphor for life: starting off fun and playful (childhood), moved on to exploration of the world (teenage years), then violently thrust into a strange world, with no other options but wander around wondering what we were going to do next (adulthood), until we got tired and wrinkled and eventually fell asleep (death)."
625	2	a	Overall, it was a cool experience, but I would have appreciated a bit more of a come-up, and the ability to reflect afterwards.

627	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Small Group (2-9) (17)
628	2	a	The setting was a very large psytrance festival in Europe. Nearly 30,000 brave souls had gathered for 5 days in a beautiful setting on the shores of a lake. The festival featured a huge psychedelic temple, fire dancers from four continents, amazing multi-story light shows and art instillations, lazers that bounced off the clouds, and a troupe of stilt walkers with extremely intricate costumes who I made friends with the very first night. For four days and nights I had been partying hard. In the previous 48 hours I had consumed mushrooms, LSD, peyote, MDMA, MDA, 2CI, 2Cb, 2CT7, 5-meo-DMT, and Ayahuasca (the Ayahuasca wasn't that strong, everything else was stronger than I had ever had). 
629	2	a	For the final night of the party I had decided to eat a ten strip of Albert Hofmann blotter that I had been saving. I remember dancing. I remember the lights. The sound of fire spinning around. The smell of the earth itself as thousands stomped the ground, raising a cloud of dust. At some point (I think it was around midnight) I asked a guy on the dance floor next to me if I could have a drink out of his water bottle. He told me to help myself, that it was in his bag that was sitting under the speaker next to us. I found it and took a very long hard swig, planning on refilling it for him at one of the water spigots that were set up. Just as I was about to finish chugging his water, he ran up and grabbed my arm, asking me 'does that water bottle have a black line drawn on it'? I looked at it and told him it did. This is when he began a low maniacal laugh that I will remember for the rest of my life. I asked with some trepidation what was in the bottle. His answer: 'Man, I hope you like LSD and speed!'
630	2	a	This in itself would have been fine, but the 10 strip was just kicking in, and I knew I was in for a bit of a ride. The next couple of hours were a bit of a blur. I remember trying to get a bottle of water at one of the bars and trying to jump over the bar. The guy running it was extremely patient with me. I think. Sometime later that evening I ended up sitting on a speaker box as the beat tore through me. BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM at 138 beats a minute was rattling my soul. The world was an infinite latticework of energy, my consciousness a tiny node on a psychedelic shimmering net that stretched from alpha to omega. Time and space itself were my playthings. I could look at some person dancing on the other side of the dance floor and with the mere will for it to be, I could see into their souls. It was too much to keep my eyes open, so I lowered my head into my lap and began to watch the light show inside.
631	2	a	It was at this point that my stilt walker friends must have seen me, sitting on a speaker with my head in my lap, rocking gently back and forth, and known EXACTLY what was going on. The came up to me and formed a semi-circle around me. With stilts on their hands and feet. In gorilla costumes. With grunting speaker boxes hidden on their chests.
632	2	a	I opened my eyes and looked up. Directly in front of me were a half a dozen gorillas grunting with great apparent concern for my wellbeing. Behind them were thousands of people dancing under a huge psychedelic temple to pounding music. One of these two things could not be happening. I had to make a choice.
633	2	a	After a few seconds my gestalt shifted. My world view changed. Finally, I realized what was going on. Clearly I was on drugs. I must have eaten something funny. My pack was concerned for me. Oh, did I mention that I must be a tripping gorilla who had hallucinated the entire human race? I got down of the speaker box and left the dance floor. I climbed the hill behind the temple to have a better vantage point, and for at least the next couple of hours I sat their, watching the dance floor pulsing, marveling at the ability of my ape brain to create such a complex hallucination as mankind. It wasn't until just before sunrise that my peak subsided, and I realized what had been going on. It was, to this day, the most intense trip and comedown I have ever experienced. I wouldn't trade it for the world.

635	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Festival / Lg. Crowd (24)
636	2	a	The following is a recall of last Saturday.  Me and a friend did an experiment involving marijuana, LSD(acid), at Cedar Point.
637	2	a	A vibration pounds on the side of my mattress, ripping me from my peaceful sleep. C calls and wakes me up.  Today is the day we do the adventure to Cedar Point on acid.
638	2	a	I get to D's house to pick up C and S.  S hands me a large bag of marijuana and gives me the box of blunts I forgot to take home the last night.  I understand without being told and split a blunt, empty the tobacco and refill it with marijuana. We then stop at the gas station to stock up on food (Doritos) and Drink (Dr. Pepper).  C steals S's spot in the front seat.
639	2	a	I have now been driving on the highway for about fifteen minutes.  Spencer pulls out the blunt I rolled earlier and we smoke it.  The blunt hits very harsh, there is more paper than marijuana and I'm slightly disappointed.  The blunt gets me pretty high nevertheless and the drive becomes much more enjoyable.  I even turn up the music and giggle a little bit.  I feel very excited and hopeful about the day that's about to happen.
640	2	a	In the past half hour we have gotten on a toll road and started to roll more blunts.  I decide that since I am driving I should let C roll the blunt because it's his weed and even though I've never really seen him roll a blunt, I figure he can do it because he rolls good joints.  The blunt he rolls is very odd looking and not very pleasant but it's definitely smokeable.  
641	2	a	I have my own weed and a very strong desire to have a good blunt available while at cedar point so I tell C to take the wheel and roll a very decent blunt that will hit good, stay tight, and even a nice little mouthpiece.  After we finish rolling the blunts we have a large open space to finish driving to ohio, about 40 minutes if I had to guess.  We have a bowl and marijuana but me and C agree that bowls will ruin the very nice blunt high we have going right now and decide not to smoke bowls until after the day is over.
642	2	a	We are about 15 miles away from our exit and the end of this terrible toll road.  This road makes you stop and get tickets then stop and pay money.  It confuses me and angers me as I've never been on a toll road before.  Since the driving portion is almost over me and C drop our acid.  He takes 2 and I take one because I'm driving.  S has no acid to take because he thought it would be a bad idea and took his the night before.
643	2	a	We come to the toll road and the woman asks for $4.75.  I check to make sure she meant four dollars, then continue on towards cedar point, pissed off that I had to pay to drive.  Why do I have to pay money to pay attention, keep my car from going off the road, and not hit anything?  I think that I should be getting paid for doing it successfully.  The world doesn't make sense I decide.
644	2	a	"We have finally made it to cedar point and we are now waiting in line.  I can feel the beginning effects of the acid kick in.  S tells me that it took a long time for it to fully kick in for him, 90 minutes as he described it.  I don't believe him at the time, but I would soon find out he was right.	I see a man walking around and talking to random people and wanting to know whats going on I ask him what he's doing.  He tells me this crazy story which I couldn't follow and then offers me 2 tickets for 25 dollars each.  I think wow that sounds good, they are 42 at the gate.  	'Do they work' I ask him."
645	2	a	Needing no further explanation Me and S buy the tickets.  I could tell that C was hoping he would get them and realizes he still has to pay 42 dollars.  His acid must be affecting him because he didn't give the man any money and he still tried to grab at the tickets. After walking in the gates C chews up the map and we are lost for the rest of the day.
646	2	a	We have now journeyed to the first ride of the day, the power tower, because of the small wait.  While standing in line I break two more hits of acid off the strip, giving one to C and taking one myself bringing my dose to 2 and his to 3.  I knew that it hadn't been an hour and a half and my acid hasn't even started really kicking in yet but I figure if it's taking this long it must not be very strong acid.
647	2	a	"Standing in line is fine right now, killing time is easy by just talking to C and S and taking in the scenery.  I feel very happy and still excited about the day.  I remember saying	'I knew this was a good idea'."
648	2	a	Finally we are loading onto the ride.  The first hit of acid has gotten much stronger in the last ten minutes and as C begins to sit where I can't see him I protest and make him switch seats so that I'm sitting next to people I know.  We all take our shoes off and wait to be shot upward hundreds of feet.  It happens.  Going straight up that fast really confused me and I felt a huge adrenaline rush go through my body.  This felt different than anything I've ever done, but it filled me with happiness and energy and I ran from the ride sliding down the railing wanting to go ride more rides.  S was not tripping acid though and wanted to go to the beach to smoke one of the blunts that we rolled.  I couldn't argue that.
649	2	a	It has been a long walk ever since the power tower and we are just now passing the Corkscrew.  Exhausted and confused I tell S and C that we have to ride the corkscrew right now while the line is short.  The wait is perfectly fine with me still, just me hanging out with my friends, talking about stuff.  The ride is pretty fun, but nothing mind blowing.  The acid still isn't causing any obvious visuals, or audio distortions.  The acid is making me think different and enhancing my mood, but anything else was still very subtle.
650	2	a	The acid is getting stronger by the minute and I warmly accept it.  I am really completely fearless right now and willing to do anything.  We stamp our hands at the cedar point gate and walk along the sidewalk near the beach.  Suddenly I decide I want to be different from everyone else and jump the fence separating us from the sand.  I step back and with little warning run, jump, climb the fence, jump, and fall.  And fall.  Turns out there was a very big drop off from the sidewalk to the sand.  I collapse as soon as I hit the ground and roll onto my stomach. Luckily the sand doesn't hurt me and my friends follow.
651	2	a	After walking through the sand as far away from the park as we could get without getting wet, we light up the blunt and hope that a cop doesn't walk by.  People are everywhere and I kind of worry but I go for it anyways.  Maybe we can burry the blunt before anyone gets here and run for it.  Hitting the blunt makes me feel very different after the very first hit.  Everything seems so crazy all of the sudden.  I start telling my two friends how marijuana is such a big part of my life, even though they know that more than almost anyone.  I start to realize that ever since I took the acid I haven't felt the marijuana high very much at all, the acid was completely taking over the feelings of dumb happiness and making me think very rapidly.
652	2	a	Before taking my second hit I look over to the Lake.  (Or ocean I'm not really sure what it was, it was a large body of water).  The water goes all the way out to the horizon and merges with the blue sky, and I notice how incredible the clouds are.  I inform my friends that the clouds are moving, and I am just astounded.  I start walking towards the horizon, not knowing what it is I want to accomplish, only knowing that I want to be as close to this amazing spectacle as I can.  Before I step into the lake completely clothed my friends drag me back.  I turn to C and say guess what.  I hit the blunt and suddenly he remembers that were smoking a blunt in public and his eyes get very wide and he holds out his hand to take his turn.
653	2	a	After a while C becomes exhausted from walking through sand and sits down with the blunt.  S tells us that we are sitting right next to a path and we are only separated by the hill we are sitting behind.  The blunt is getting very small and I don't think it would be worth it to try to get C to stand up in his state of mind.  S walks off with the blunt and I chase him down and get it back.  I convince him to wait until we can get C up and we finish the blunt as C gathers his items and works his way to his feet.
654	2	a	I sit and gaze at my surroundings.  The acid has completely kicked in and I am tripping out of my mind.  I love the beach and want to continue sitting here for the rest of my life.  I stare at the seagulls and I see a small patch of land a little past the tide.  I run towards the water and jump landing right on the patch of land and scaring hundreds of seagulls away.  I'm sad that I scared so many lives away and negatively impacted them, but happy that I am completely surrounded by water.  It's a very peaceful feeling.  Suddenly S informs us that we have been at the beach too long and I begin to panic.  Do people know we're on drugs?  Is anyone going to tell on us?  Am I going to go to prison and be stuck in Ohio?  Terrible things start affecting my brain and the only thing I can do is ask S what we can do to fix everything.  He says we have to go back to the part and starts walking away from the beach.
655	2	a	'Wait!' I tell him 'I'm not ready to leave.'  S and C both leave and I am stuck either chasing them down or staying at the beach alone.  I chase down C and ask him why we have to leave.  S continues walking.  C gets confused and suddenly tells me that the sand shatters when you walk on it.  I look down and he was correct.  Every step we took caused the sand to create strange patterns all around us.  Seeing me have such a big impact just by walking was an incredible feeling and we started walking around very slowly watching the sand make patterns.
656	2	a	I realized that S was no longer with us and looked up to see if I saw him.  As soon as I looked up I saw the clouds and there were rainbows everywhere in the sky.  My vision was made up of a bunch of colored diamonds that were shrinking and enlarging rapidly.  I started to hear noises from people in the park.  I could hear everyone who was in about a quarter mile range and all the voices were echoed and distorted so I couldn't make out what they were saying but it started to scare me.  I begin to worry that this could be a bad trip.  I ask C if he wants to stay at the beach with me and he's confused and says we can't waste this trip by staying at the beach.  I agree for some reason and we make our way to the sidewalk.
657	2	a	Walking through the sand is now a very unpleasant feeling and suddenly I am seeing everything repeat itself in time.  I am watching myself do things that I have already done yet everything else continues on.  This worries me because I can't change my actions and everyone else can.  As suddenly as this wild feeling of deja vu kicked it, it suddenly left me as though it never happened.
658	2	a	Note:  I will do the best I can to remember the times of the following events, but at this point I was afraid to hold my phone because I thought I would break it so I stopped checking the time for about an hour.
659	2	a	Me and C have now made it back to the sidewalk and we sit down at a bench.  I am way messed up now and the acid is still getting more and more intense.  I wonder how C is doing because he took a hit more than me.  We decide that I should lead until we find S.  I try to call S and when I talk to him he sounds very confused and can't tell me where he is.  I hang up because I'm frustrated.  We try to call back and he doesn't pick up so we walk back into the park.
660	2	a	We are now wandering around completely helpless around Cedar Point hallucinating, disoriented, lost, and un-functional.  C suggests we ride a ride and I tell him we need to find S.  I try to explain that we just took someone from a different state and dropped him off at an amusement park.  C doesn't seem to grasp the idea and continues suggesting we just ride rides and don't worry about it.
661	2	a	I give up looking for S.  We walk into the entrance closest to us and get ready to ride a ride.  I walk through the metal thing that turns and get in line.  Suddenly I realize how long this line is and how long we have to wait.  I feel like everyone in line is staring at me.  I freak out and without saying a word to C I push about 6 people out of my way and squeeze through the metal thing and continue walking.  I realize a few people had shouted at me and suddenly consider the thought that other people have feelings too.  Up until this point I had completely forgotten the concept of the human being except for C and S.
662	2	a	I apologize to C for causing such an embarrassing scene.  It wasn't that I was afraid or anything, I just never considered the fact that other people wouldn't want to be pushed.  I could easily have stayed in line, I just didn't want to stay there that long with everyone staying with me, and it seemed perfectly logical to do what I wanted.  C asks where we are going and I say I don't know, maybe we should look for S.  He tells me that it's S's fault for getting lost and we should ride rides.  We see the corkscrew for the second time and I decide that this is the perfect opportunity to gauge how the acid effects the ride.
663	2	a	In what felt like hours of waiting (actually 20 minutes), Me and C finally made it to the front of the line.  A woman turned to me and asked if I wanted to go before her daughters so she could go at the same time as them.  This made me extremely happy and very thankful for the woman's kindness.  Minutes were taking eternities to pass and even knowing that we will get to ride a minute or two sooner than we would have originally was plenty to make me overwhelmingly happy.  After thanking the woman me and C stepped up to the gate where we waiting to be seated.  I noticed how the 3 men running the ride all had microphones and were talking to each other trying to crack jokes.  I noted how bizzare the human race is that we actually need to hire people to keep patrons entertained because the park is too boring otherwise.  This was a turning point in the trip and I started thinking about the people that own Cedar Point and how they are treating human beings like they don't have emotions or thoughts.
664	2	a	The man begins giving instructions after we are seated in the large metal contraption.  He says we have to fasten our seat belts and after fumbling around for a minute or two I finally figured it out.  C remained completely oblivious to all instructions.  A man came up to C and said please fasten your seat belt and pull on it.  C said nothing and continued staring forward in a stupor.  Confused the man just ignored C and cleared us to go.  C looks over me and says 'Oh, were we supposed to do something?'  
665	2	a	'Dude, think of how smart the guy who owns this place must be' I reply 'He convinces people from all over the world to pay money just to enter this giant park, then makes you wait in lines to be put into a quick ride.  People from all over the world.  Wow I just realized how insignificant we are compared to all of this.  Even if people do know we're on acid it's not going to matter because they all have better stuff to do than tell on us.'  I began seeing the world through other people's eyes and realize that in their eyes I am a nobody.  Suddenly my body is hurled up then I'm thrown into a loop.  The roller coaster seems to be moving extremely slow and all the sudden I just got really happy.  I start laughing uncontrollably.  The roller coaster does a corkscrew and while we are upside down I feel like I could just fly away.  The ride stops suddenly and I am very disappointed, wanting the ride to keep going.
666	2	a	We exit the ride and begin wandering around the park again.  At this point Spencer has called me multiple times but I stopped using my phone because I thought I would break it so it stays in my pocket.  The first thing I remember coming to as we left the corkscrew was a railroad with the gates down.  On both sides of the railroad tracks are huge packs of people, each wanting to go in the other direction.  As soon as the gates go up everyone pushes forward, me and C follow not wanting to stand out.  Everyone looks very sorry and hurried as we push through the bodies.  I see a woman pushing a stroller through the massive pack of people who looks very scared.  I feel sorry for her and want to stop pushing and just let everyone pass through me, but I know I will cause a scene if I do anything and just continue shoving.  This also pushed my trip in the wrong direction, making me feel like a terrible person, and making me hate Cedar Point even more.
667	2	a	At this point we are near familiar features such as the fountain and the arcade room.  C suggests we go play video games to try to calm our minds down.  Willing to believe anything to gain a bit of sanity I follow him in.  The instant I set foot in the arcade I knew it was a terrible idea.  Flashing colors were everywhere, and millions and millions of computerized sounds echoing off the walls, all merging together and creating one very strange and unpleasant hum.  I knew there were people in the arcade but I couldn't distinguish any bodies, I could just hear the voices echoing in my mind.  The first game that has a seat I plop down and stare at the screen in front of me.  I feel very awkward sitting inside the tiny car video game, but I feel that it's too late to change my mind.  I find quarters and put them in the machine.  C helps me start the game but soon he is playing a game of his own and I am left to figure out on my own.  I sit and stare like a retard until the game starts on its own.  I realize that I have to drive a car and press the pedal.  I'm moving but moving extremely slow.  The colors on the video game look extremely unrealistic and they start swaying and bubbling.  After about two minutes of staring like a retard I put the car into second gear.  I like going fast.  I start laughing very loudly but I can't stop playing the game because I haven't finished yet.  After about 10 minutes of me and C laughing hysterically playing a racing game we stumble out of the arcade and finally agree to look for S.
668	2	a	After sitting in one place for about 5 minutes (It seemed like hours, we even got up for almost a minute then remembered we were supposed to stay) S was able to locate us.  I'm happy we finally have found S and I ask him if he would like to ride some rides.  S seems disconnected from the world I'm in and I realize that communication is impossible.
669	2	a	Waiting in line for the 3d dissapator or something, suddenly I'm given new hope for Cedar Point.  I realize that we have already rode a few rides and done a lot of drugs.  I would rather have ridden more rides but maybe people will go home and we will have the park to ourselves I think.  Once we get inside the building waiting in line isn't such a chore anymore.  Before now, me and C were completely silent in the lines and just stared at each other to make sure if anyone was staring at us, at least we wouldn't be staring back because that's how I got myself into trouble on the ferris wheel.  The acid had me very paranoid and I had to gather myself each time before getting very close to people (like waiting in line).
670	2	a	The indoor section of the line was very dark lit and had a lot of bright colors and 3d effects everywhere.  It was very pleasant but my visuals had stopped and it was nothing too insane. After the line moved forward a bit there was a green substance splattered on the wall that appeared to be crawling.  I asked S if the green thing looked like it was moving around to him and a few people gave me sketchy looks.  I smiled to myself.
671	2	a	The ride itself was cool, but it was very dark lit and no strange visuals occurred.  The ride was fun, and probably scared me more than normal, but now the effects of the acid were mainly mental.
672	2	a	"Me, S, and C have now all made our way back to the beach where we this time walk to a very secluded area to smoke another blunt.  After the 3d ride we got lockers and put our hoodies away.  At this point my jean pockets are extremely full and I am feeling very overwhelmed wanting to get my hoody back as soon as possible.  After smoking the blunt that C rolled earlier in the car I am unsatisfied and want a nice blunt to smoke.  C finds a new map lying in the sand and hands it to me in attempt to redeem himself for earlier.  I use the map as a tray and roll a blunt.  I then fold up the remaining pot inside the map, not realizing that I could have used it to find my way to rides. 	We smoke the second blunt and this time feel much more paranoid.  Many people are staring at us and this time I don't feel happy.  The sky is starting to get darker and a mood of sadness sets into the park."
673	2	a	We walk back from the beach to the park.  We instantly go back and get our hoodies because of the freezing temperature.  After wandering for over an hour I vow to get in the next line I see.  After I get in line I change my mind and jump over the railing and we continue walking.  We have now reached the exit and getting angry I shout 'I didn't come here to walk, I came to ride rides!'  S leads us to the demon drop.  Suddenly I have intense flashbacks to when I was 8 years old and here with my parents.  
674	2	a	Almost a decade ago,  I remember getting on the demon drop.  The demon drop is a ride where you are sat in a large steel box.  The steel box is raised a hundred feet or so into the air and then you do a bar guided free fall.  As the box reached the peak and started moving forward to begin the plunge I immediately freaked out and started screaming.  'Wait stop the ride I don't want to do this!' Instantly the ride dropped and I felt like my body was being split in two.  I came back a few years after that incident and rode the ride just to prove that I was a big boy.
675	2	a	Anyways now I was back, and I started describing my past life to C.  I have a very strange past life as I used to live in a different state and moved when I was 10.  I was always open minded, but I had a complete different personality for half of my life.  Anyways I could tell I was freaking C out by telling him this while he was on acid so I just stopped and waited in silence.  After being seated on the ride C tells me to put my feet against the steel in front of us.  The man running the ride comes over and tells us to keep our feet off of it.  I am instantly angered.  Does he think I'm going to break the steel box?  Does Cedar Point treat all of their customers like that?  Before I can  protest the ride begins and our box starts its ascent.  Not at all wanting to ride the ride I once again think of my 8 year old self.  As the box begins moving forward I feel exactly as I did 9 years ago and It feels like my body is being ripped apart as we drop from the giant metal tower.  After the ride my heart is pounding and  I feel very excited once again.
676	2	a	We have wondered around the park looking for rides with lines less than 2 hours long and have been completely unsuccessful.  Once we ended up going into a room filled with fog and no light.  There were strange people coming up to us and trying to scare us, and it was working.  After leaving that part of the park all I can do is complain that we had to walk through a ride.  Giving up we decide to leave the park.  Only problem is I'm still tripping and can't drive yet.  I know that I won't be sober in time for the park to close but I know that waiting an hour or two will help a lot.  Willing to do anything to kill time we wait in line for the ferris wheel.
677	2	a	We have boarded the ferris wheel and it is interesting gazing at the parking lot. It's crazy how this many people will all come to one place to wait in lines.  It feels like I've been at Cedar Point all my life and I'm ready to leave it behind forever.  I tell my friends my decision to never return to Cedar Point and C for the time being agrees.  I start explaining what my day has been like and C tells me we need to stop talking until the acid wears off.  We have been talking about everything for the entire day and it seems logical to take a break.  At the moment I can't even describe how my day went, and just accept the silence.
678	2	a	The day is finally over I tell myself as I sit down in my car.  C breaks out a bag of chips and a 2 liter of Dr. Pepper.  I completely forgot about them and I start laughing.  I'm having much more fun in my car than I had at cedar point the past couple hours.  S immediately passes out in the back seat.  He didn't sleep the night before because he was up doing the acid that we were supposed to do at Cedar Point.
679	2	a	I have not yet put the key in the ignition and C points this out.  'Oh I just wasn't going to drive until someone made me' I reply. 'Drive' commands C.  I drive.  Confused I tell C that its his job to tell me exactly when and where to turn for the entire drive back home.  With much difficulty and confusion we exit the Cedar Point Parking lot.  I have almost no visuals anymore and just have a strange head buzz that makes me feel somehow 'different' but not very messed up.
680	2	a	C asks me if I'm going to stop at a gas station soon.  I ask him why I would do that when he told me he didn't want to go to one. 'Oh I meant I did want to go to one' he replies.  I see a sign that says 'Last stop in ohio!' I tell C he's in luck. It's pretty large store for being a gas station on the side of the highway and I'm pretty impressed.  As soon as I walk in I see a coffee mug with a red bird and the word 'Ohio'.  I know that this cup has chosen me and I bring it to the checkout.  C orders a pizza and a Coffee.  I then order the coffee with the longest name and it turns out to be a delicious frappachino.
681	2	a	After receiving our merchandise we successfully drove home and went to J's place to sleep.  Arriving at about 1 in the morning we immediately tried going to sleep.  Me and C still had acid in our systems and stayed up playing Super Smash bros. Meelee  until 2 am when he passed out.  I didn't fall asleep until 4 am. The next day my legs felt like they had been run over.
682	2	a	The entire day C wanted to get food but every time we saw the line we changed our mind.  On acid we couldn't convince ourselves to spend that much time doing nothing.  We ate out of vending machines the entire day.
683	2	a	Me and C only separated once for about 5 seconds when he left me at a drinking fountain.  He told me that everyone started moving really fast when he couldn't find me.
684	2	a	Stay away from mirrors.  They mess with your head.
685	2	a	All in all I have to say that it was a good experience.   I would never do it again purely because standing around doing nothing is boring and being on acid makes it even more intensely boring.  This is definitely the hardest I have ever tripped in my life and it has possibly changed a few things about my thinking.  I don't think I would really recommend this trip for anyone, as if I would've freaked out at all I think I would have gone insane.  We really weren't expecting the acid to be any good so we really just dosed to fast, so if you think you could pull it off go for it, but be careful.  Give your acid plenty of time to kick in.

687	2	a	Abt. 11a.m.: A not quite euphoric high begins to build, w/ slight anxiety
688	2	a	Abt. 12p.m.: Rising high stalls and almost disappears until 1p.m.
689	2	a	Abt.2p.m.: Heavy 'stoned' feeling sets in w/o usual psychedelic character. More a narcotic, opiate-like stoned, only slightly trippy. Not dysphoric but not esp. 'happy' and lightheaded like LSD is (for anon.).
690	2	a	Abt. 3 p.m.: Peak. Kind of an LSA/alcohol type inebriation, w/o LSA nausea. Neither deeply meditative or fun, rather boring really. No visuals aside from subtle color variations and waving (but not exactly) effect on objects.
691	2	a	3-5 p.m.: Pretty even plateau. Gradual drop off until sometime after 12 a.m. Slept poorly. 
692	2	a	Conclusion: CERTAINLY not LSD. A wild guess it was some RC, a phen maybe, tho. based on reading only, anon has no exp. aside from mesc. The blotter was unperforated and an off white color...anon pitched remaining blotter.

694	2	a	LSD (2), Unknown (120) : What Was in That? (26), General (1), Unknown Context (20)
695	2	a	This/Last (today is Sunday that I am typing this) Friday I had the fun experience of trying acid once again. I was hanging out with my usual friends, and my parents were out of town for the entire weekend so I had planned to have a small group of friends come over and smoke pot, snort cocaine, and drink. Well I got news that we could get acid, a guy had 20 hits of blotter paper, so we went out and bought the entire sheet. I bought 2 hits of acid for 10$. I was kind of had a pessimistic outlook on it, because I had been ripped off before. But this acid was real, *very* real. I am very glad that I had not started out with 4 hits, as that would have been way to much for me - even 2 hits was a very visual, intense trip. Here's how it went.
696	2	a	At around 9:30 I took the acid, left it on my tongue for a while, flipped sides, then eventually chewed it up and swallowed it. All my other friends took the acid at various times. All of them took 2 hits, except one person who took 6 hits (a more experienced tripper). When we got to my house, I just got ready to trip. I turned on my black light, and put on some Pink Floyd. 30 minutes or so later, after smoking a joint outside, things started to happen. I went inside and looked on my computer screen, my desktop picture (of the moon, starts, and nebula) was moving - as if it was a screensaver. It seemed as if the picture had different 'layers' to it, and each layer was moving a different way. The sun in the picture made me squint, even though it was not real - as if the picture was real!
697	2	a	Things started getting crazier and crazier every minute. We experienced some confusion as to what was going on since everybody in my house was tripping - rather funny, we could not stop laughing not matter what we did. A little ways later, I went into my room alone when everybody else was in the living room, laid down in my dark lighted room with Pink Floyd playing and stared at my scenic pictures on the wall. All of a sudden everything round the pictures disappeared and turned into black space, and the pictures seem to be '3D'. The frames of the pictures turned into fluorescent rainbow colors, and seemed to stick out, as if I could touch the back of the pictures on the wall. Truly an amazing sight. For no apparent reason I started laughing out loud, in my room, alone. The music sounded *amazing*, Pink Floyd was truly made for tripping. Totally euphoric.
698	2	a	I then went to talk to my other friends. The guy who took 6 hits was totally out of it. He was going nuts, in a good way. All the wall paper on my walls, and just about every surface was either breathing or moving in some sort of weird way. We were outside for a bit when it started raining, and that felt very good. I could go on countless hours about the visuals I saw, which were so amazing, but I won't. I called a sober friend of mine, just to see what she would sound like while I am tripping. That kind of kept me in a 'peaceful' state of mind since I knew that everything was not going crazy, and that I will still come down when it is over which kept me in a good mood. She stayed on the phone for nearly 4 hours with me, listening to me babble on, even putting the phone down for 20 minutes straight at 3:00 in the morning! That is truly a good friend, as I know I was probably scaring her with everything I said, but she enjoyed talking to me while I was tripping and I did too.
699	2	a	I peaked and did some just plain weird things. I hid in my closet with the lights off for no apparent reason, then scared the living shit out of one of my friends who walked into my room alone when I jumped out, he screamed and nearly freaked out. Later, after we came down a little bit, me and a friend went outside and wrote 'trip' in shaving cream on a friends wind shield just to do something. The trip was amazing, highly visual, and euphoric - but the next day was horrible. I felt like I was 'out of it' the entire day. Probably because I got no sleep, and smoked a bunch of pot all throughout the next day. I was afraid to even talk to my parents on the phone because I would stumble on every word, but alas everything turned out fine when I woke up Sunday at a friends house and was totally fine and feeling good. I would repeat that any time, just maybe during the day next time, a little earlier, so I will be down at night time and be able to sleep at my normal weekend sleeping times so I would wake up in the morning actually feeling normal enough to talk to authority if I needed to.
700	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
701	2	a	It was my first LSD trip in a year. I had two sugarcubes, each one imbibed with two drops of some reportedly strong liquid LSD. My plan: to take them in my mom and stepdad's apartment while they were at work and be coming down by the time they got home.
702	2	a	I woke up at 11:00 AM on a Saturday. Got up, got dressed, meditated for about a half hour, turned down the lights, burned some incense and candles to set a contemplative mood. Finally, I crunched the cubes down and put on some music: The Grateful Dead's 'Infared Roses'.
703	2	a	About a half hour later I could feel the acid coming on. I decided to put on some more uptempo music so I popped in 'Demetertainment', a Twisted Records psytrance compilation. Beast - 'Spawn' was sounding a might fucking nice! ;) The acid was coming on and I kept repeating to myself: 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - as I felt my mindstate elevating.
704	2	a	The music was playing and I was grooving around my living room and noticing that this was indeed some strong LSD. Mind manifesting indeed! I felt like I was walking around in my mind. I felt some kind of weird aura around my body, maybe just a heightened awareness of the somatic energies in my body. I don't know but I felt something.
705	2	a	I started looking at some Sandman comic book called 'Dream Hunters' and was marvelling at this Japanese artist's watercolor/hand-drawn art in it and then I turned on my laptop and started playing around with that Fractint program for a bit (the whole trip I was seeing MAD fractals every time I closed my eyes. Fractal OD!) I started reading some stuff I'd written that was on my computer and was disappointed I hadn't finished one of my longer poems, but reading it was fun because I didn't remember any of it. It was as if someone else had  written it and I was reading it for the first time. Shortly after this I had a phrase come into my head.....my quote of the day: 'The universe loves AHA's!'
706	2	a	I then started to look at some of the art my friend had done on this comic book project we were collaborating on and it looked amazing in my heightened state and I started wondering why the fuck we aren't rich bastards yet so I decided to page him to urge him to get to work, but his pager number had changed and I kept getting the wrong number. I called his house and his dad told me he'd moved out (he just got a new apartment) but he didn't have his new phone number yet, he did, however, give me a new pager number....but I wrote it down wrong!!! I just kept getting wrong number tones. It was imperative that I talked to my friend at this point. I took it as a bad omen that I couldn't page him or talk to him.
707	2	a	I had planned on not leaving the apartment because I have some annoyingly nosey neighbors in my apartment complex which made me nervous, but I had to go outside to see what it looked like. It was a beautiful day, sunshiny with not a cloud in the sky. I saw my landlord J*** and decided to say hi to him (I was on the 3rd floor balcony and he was down in this little courtyard on the ground floor cleaning a barbeque grill) I said hello, but he didn't hear me. I kept saying hello but he still didn't hear me (he's an old guy) and for some reason I thought something might be wrong with him the way he was standing there so I thought I'd go down and talk to him to see if he was okay. There goes my plan of not leaving my apartment.
708	2	a	So, I go down and there's my landlord and I say 'Hi there, nice day isn't it?' and he gives me this little elderly grin and a nod and says 'Oh yeah, 80 degrees, perfect day.' Very, very prophetic words, I felt. We both looked up into the sky, admiring the day. It was a moment. So, anyways, there I was talking to the landlord tripping balls on acid and I realized I was still holding the cordless phone from when I was trying to page my friend, which must have made me look weird. I then walked out to the front of my apartments (it is a gated apartment complex with one entrance in the front) and I went outside the gate (another violation of my plan to not leave my apartment, an unwise move) and I went and sat down on the steps in the front and just was checking out the trees and plants and stuff. I tried to go back in and realized I had Forgotten My Key! D'oh! I was locked out. I tried to go around but, being as it was a gated community, there was no way inside. I tried to get the attention of the landlord but he had left the courtyard. I saw a guy walk past me on the sidewalk and he looked sinister...I thought he was evil for some reason, but didn't really feel threatened by him, I just got bad vibes. He looked at me oddly and I just said hello and gave what, to him, must have been a weird looking smile. I was still holding the cordless phone, I noticed, so I put it in my pocket (I have big pockets.)
709	2	a	Finally, one of my neighbors let me back in the gate and I went in my apartment once more. I was glad to be back. I wasn't going to leave again. It was a bad idea in the first place, especially since I was alone. I put on some music, this time a progressive trance mixtape by a DJ named Brad called 'Mother Earth Sound System' (very good trip music I would say.) I kept getting these dehydration type feelings so I drank a big glass of water and felt good instantly. Every cell in my body celebrating my ingestion of good old H2O.
710	2	a	This is when my trip started to get weird. I was laying on my sofa and just zoning out. Zonked, if you will. I still haven't sorted out everything I was thinking but it had something to do with how every machination of my consciousness was a lie somehow and that at every thought, and impulse of thought, I was leading myself astray from my 'normal reality'. I was being given 'messages' in my head that everything is infinite and every thing is connected to it's opposite and that everything WAS it's opposite because everything taken to it's extreme had the potential to become it's opposite, which, in hindsight, was some pretty basic yin-yang type stuff.
711	2	a	Time was totally out of whack. I did an experiment to see how long it felt like a minute passed and I looked the clock and counted to 60 and it seemed like I was counting forever. I kept getting these weird linguistic babblings in my head (I always experience this on upper doses of LSD and it actually kind of bugs me) it's like unpronounceable sentences revolving in my brain. I figured it was some kind of distortion in the way my brain was processing language so I took the time to say the alphabet a few times to make sure I still had my language faculties. I did! Whew! No brain damage for me! (?)
712	2	a	I started zoning out some more and just felt totally weird. I was thinking some very far out shit like, because I was thinking certain ways and certain things (things I can't exactly remember), the day would not end. Night would never come and it would be perpetual day forever. Time lagged on and seemed to reaffirm this notion. I somehow managed to remember that my mom and step-dad were supposed to be coming home and if they DIDN'T come home as expected and day DIDN'T end, then I would have something to worry about...until then I would just not worry about it. I also was thinking about some of my family members and all the dysfunction in my family and how I was seemingly trapped in the karmic cycles of my upbringing. For me to explain this I would have to tell my whole family history, which I'm not going to do.
713	2	a	Eventually, my parents did come home and I felt better about that and I just sat on the couch watching TV like a cosmic retard, trying not to look like I was on drugs, just being low key and quiet. Eventually, they both left to go do some other stuff and I was alone again, but by then I was feeling a bit more 'normal'. I was trying to remember all the stuff I was thinking about just hours before. I felt like I'd lived a whole lifetime in one afternoon. I felt energized. Shakti/Chi/Energy was coursing through my body. Moving around was effortless. I felt like I was floating. My pupils were huge and I went outside and looked at the sun going down and the moon becoming visible. My mind roared silently. Libra moon. Glorious. 
714	2	a	After a while a friend came over to my house and we went out to eat and I told him about my trip. All in all, it was a pretty intense experience.
715	2	a	[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]
716	2	a	So my experience begins on a cold New England night.  The sky is clear and the stars are shining brightly.  It's about 8:30pm when I decide that I should take the remaining acid from a 10 strip I bought a while back.  I was alone in my home, parents had gone away and my brother had wondered off to who knows where.  I felt that being alone for a trip could be a growing experience for me, since almost all my previous psychedelic experiences involved fairly large numbers of people being around.  My intension for this trip was to explore myself, my mind.  
717	2	a	So I slip the blotter onto my tongue, with that pre-trip tension in my stomach.  Then I go downstairs to my living room, and pop on the TV.  It's about 45 minutes later I notice the first effects.  The windows in the room had white lacy curtains with flower designs.  These flowers began to swirl majestically, while the curtains swayed in the acid breeze.  Then I looked at my couch, it was divided up into perfectly symmetrical squares that were all rotating counter-clockwise.  So I thought, 'well here I go'.  I only watched TV for another 10-15 minutes before I decided I should go to my room, throw on some music, turn the lights off, and lay in bed.  
718	2	a	I chose the new Tool album Lateralus as the soundtrack to my journey, and this suited the trip fine.  The album flew by, its almost a full 80 minutes long, but for some reason it went by very quickly.  So instead of time slowing like it should it went much faster at least for that 80 minutes.  But during that time I saw some of the most beautiful CEV's that I could ever have imagined.  The only one I remember vividly was what appeared to be some sort of a fish creature, that had no real head, and its whole body swayed through the liquid colors.  Around this time I began to think about my life.  I came to many conclusions about what I should do and where I should direct my life.  I also figured out what I percieved God really is, but I won't go into that.  I don't want to rant on about things that I think are nearly impossible to explain.  If anyone knows the album I was listening too, the last track 'Faaip De Oiad' is a creepy phone message from a man talking about aliens with loud jarring music.  When this came on I felt an incredible fear rush throughout my body, but it went away as soon as the song ended.  
719	2	a	After the cd was over, again it went by so quickly, I turned the lights in my room on.  My god I was tripping hard.  Everything was divided into symmetrical shapes, and were spinning wildly.  A poster on my wall, a print of a Alex Grey painting 'Praying', was very cool.  The persons veins in the painting were pulsing, the person seemed to be living. I then put on a Sonic Youth cd, listened to one song, got a jacket on and went outside.  I layed down inthe grass facing the sky.  The stars were absolutely stunning.  They were sparkling, and each star would change color frequently.  And if I focused I could make the sky become symmetric, divided into 3 sections.  I spent quite a while out there.  But when I came back to my room...the same song was playing on my cd player.  I guess the cd was on repeat, but that totally shocked me at the time.  I thought that I had walked outside, layed down and got back up, all in the span of a few notes.
720	2	a	The next few hours are pretty hazy, I know I watched some TV.  And I also know I felt no need to explore my mind anymore then I already had that night.  I felt I had all the answers I would ever need.
721	2	a	The trip really did change the way that I actually thought for a a few weeks.  It is hard to explain, but the way I thought was actually transformed.  The biggest effect was that nothing petty even fazed me.  I never felt like arguing about anything with anyone for any reason, that all felt below me.  But I noticed that that effect wore off over time, and I feel like my old self.  I don't know if thats good or bad though.
722	2	a	Overall this was a great experience, not my first, and definately not my last experience with this powerful drug.

724	2	a	LSD (2) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Alone (16)
725	2	a	Kid A and I decided to finish off our vial. Initially I was hesitant. That vial was supposed to last the whole summer, and was already half gone. But he gave an extremely convincing argument. Let's just do it all now, and go completely insane, it'll be so cool! I had to agree with him. It was going to be the greatest trip ever. 
726	2	a	So late that night, I took roughly 30-40 hits as did Kid A. I have yet to meet someone in person who has done this much! 
727	2	a	My visuals were simply amazing. Nothing has come even close to them. I was flipping through my Dali book, when suddenly, Dali's artwork seemed to take over my visuals. I ran to the bathroom, and in the mirror, my reflection was still my face, but it was my face painted just like Dali's own self-portrait in the book. Incredible. The whole world seemed to enter Dali's surrealistic fantasy. I was lost within the visuals and seemed to be consumed by them. I began conjuring up different images, and they seemed to flow from my mind in intricate, detailed patterns. 
728	2	a	Suddenly there was a noise. Kid A told me to shut up. I thought it was from within my house and turned off the lights, in case my parents were up. He told me to stop moving around...the sound was coming from outside. I didn't believe him, but within a few minutes I heard what he was talking about. It was coming from outside. 
729	2	a	Terror struck deep within me. What other-worldly entity could be stalking my friend and I? Had we accidentally opened a portal with our insanely huge dose of LSD? My initial response to this terror was to turn back on the lights. I needed to be able to see what was going on outside. WHAT WAS THERE?! 
730	2	a	As I got up to turn on the lights Kid A screamed, 'NO! That is a BAD idea!'. And suddenly I saw the incredible error that I was about to make and the horror that would be brought upon us. I inherently knew that if I were to turn on the lights the whole world surrounding me would dissolve into a primordial ooze. It would be lost and all that would remain would be a clear light with my soul being lost within its power forever. I knew that all would be lost, and I would be alone. I felt that LSD had created a cosmic hole in my head, and the entire universe would be sucked into it leaving me completely alone. 
731	2	a	Kid A and I lay in our separate beds, scarcely breathing. Both of our hearts racing, Kid A countlessly uttered, 'I'm tripping so hard, oh my god, this is really scary'. I too was feeling the intense effects surrounding me. My mind was awash in visuals. I was struggling to discern what was real around me, and was extremely grateful for having Kid A there. He helped ground me, and allowed me comfort in that I wouldn't be lost in this psychic journey. 
732	2	a	Slowly the terrifying presence seemed to take less of a hold on us, and actually became a little humorous. We decided to blast some Jimi Hendrix out my window. His righteous wailings on the guitar would surely scare the evil force that was residing on my front lawn. And it did. The intensity subsided quite a bit after this. But I don't exactly know when Kid A and I stopped tripping. We definitely had residual effects for the rest of the summer. Thinking back on it, I believe that I had tripped my way into an oblivious transcendent state. I felt enlightened, and appreciative of my life and my surroundings. What ensued after our crazy summer was perhaps the most productive and happy times of my life. I truly felt that life was beautiful, and every moment was to be treasured.  I was truly aware and happy. 
733	2	a	A note on this trip. At no time was this trip actually scary. I mean it was, but it was also incredible. It was extremely enjoyable. I loved each second of insane terror that was induced. It was almost too much to comprehend. I never thought that I could feel anything to this extent, and being able to almost brought tears to my eyes. It was a trip that reminded me that life is beautiful. Beauty is within everything. Don't believe me, just look at a tree for a minute. You'll find it and wonder how you could ever miss it.

735	2	a	This is a first time dream of LSD.  One microdot (approximately 5mg in total weight) was imagined sublingually at about 5 minutes before 1am, at an underground (literally and figuratively) rave event, the microdot having been acquired some days before.
736	2	a	A few minutes later, the DJ is spinning a track, 'Being on LSD is like sailing Mt. Everest...' or something similar.  Very interesting synchronicity, but I that seems par for the course with any psychedelic material.
737	2	a	After an hour, nothing is happening yet, and various people with experience of these dots have been saying that they are not very strong and require multiple dosing.
738	2	a	About 2:20, I'm not sure I'm feeling anything at all even now, maybe it's threshhold and I can't tell because of all the stimulus around me.  Anyhow, another microdot is chewed, dissolved in my mouth and swallowed.  No real taste to speak of.
739	2	a	Maybe a half hour passes and I think I'm definitely off-baseline now, but this is very different from any tryptamine or phenethylamine psychedelic I've previously imagined.  I am talking to people and notice I've started to become brutally honest.  My coordination seems to be somewhat impaired.
740	2	a	From here, the effects continued to grow, and by another half hour I was definitely sure of the action in my system. This material was completely clear and free of seeming mental warp, but my attention is extremely focused and my ability to think about things without reservation or mental strain is enormously enhanced.  In this, the effects for me are similar to MDMA but without the empathetic aspect.  To the contrary, I have become extremely analytical and critical, without much emotional feeling at all.  I realize I need to be very careful not to hurt people's feelings with my brutal honesty right now, because I know I would not want to do so in other contexts, and I have to make an allowance for my present state of mind.
741	2	a	A bit later, I run into a girl I know, and my normal shyness being absent I tell her I think she's really cute.  She's with some other guy tonight, but I get her phone number, anyhow.  I find some other people I know in order to make sure I can get a ride home later.  I spend the next few hours, walking, contemplating, talking to various friends and strangers at the party, staying very clear and comfortable throughout.
742	2	a	About 6am my ride is leaving the party, I'm still up, but I have to say that nobody would likely be able to tell at all if I didn't say something about it.  I am at least as coherent as normal, and probably moreso, there's probably some eye dilation going on but it's still dark anyhow.  I have some interesting geometic closed eye visuals.
743	2	a	7:30 or so we stop for breakfast, and meet some others of my friends.  I give them my brief bioassay report, that I think the dots are probably a low dose of LSD and not LSA as some others had suggested they might be, as I've tried LSA before and it was more sedating and less clear.  I guess this might be 50ug or less of acid per dot, though.
744	2	a	9am, I'm home.  Wonder if I can sleep.  Amazingly enough, by 10am, I do.  I can't sleep on most any other psychedelic material I've imagined.  I wake up about 3pm, and seem not to want to sleep more, but I think I'm down now.  Some visual focus issues persist, and continue an hour later as I am now writing this, perhaps my eyes are still a bit dilated.
745	2	a	Note on pain relief: As I've written in previous reports, I have tried various materials for their pain relieving benefits, this one seems to work very well indeed, but I've had a few small twinges that suggest it may not persist more than a day or two. Obviously it is premature to judge that, and many substances have a strongly dose-dependent benefit.  For example, 5-MeO-DiPT at levels below about 14mg doesn't help me much, but at 16mg provided dramatic relief for at least a week.
746	2	a	I fully intend to find some more of these and try them in a larger dose sometime.  I'd also like to combine them with MDMA to see how they interact with regard to the enhancing qualities of both materials, and perhaps with preservation of emotional effect.

748	2	a	LSD (2) : General (1), Rave / Dance Event (18)
749	2	a	about 3 days ago my younger brother ken, dad, and i traveled to a concert where the dead were playing with willy nelson. when my dad told me about it, the one thing i was thinking about was if we could find any lsd... we were walking through the parking lot to the concert (which was just a giant grass field) it was about 85 degrees out and everybody was walking through rows of cars looking for anybody with the drug of their choice. at about noon, i was walking with my brother between rows of cars and many, many tiedye shirts and i saw a very pretty girl with colorful tatoos on her  mesh fabric and fairy wings comming out of her back walk by dotting the tip of her toungue with her index finger. 'ken, look its the acid faerie!' i whispered to my brother and turned around to follow her.
750	2	a	we bought about five doses of lsd off of the girl and took it at about 2:00 in the parking lot. the concert started at an old field near our parking field at 3:30 and my brother and i had just started feeling the one hit each of lsd in the form of a subtle visual clarity and warm buzzing feeling in the emotional column of our body and spreading throughout. we walked through the crowd of tiedye, dreadlocks, and smileing flowing people right up to about 15 feet of the stage. the ancient smile of willie nelson filled my whole existence as i watched him play and sing along side of phil lesh of the dead and i smiled with the most emense understanding and colorful love i had ever expirenced. the towers of speakers on the sides of the stage were spilling out a music that felt like it had been poured over my brother and i in a thick atmospheric wave of color, sound and emotion. i looked away from the stage after having totally suberged myself in something that clearly seemed to me to be deeper than any one persons life. as i looked through the crowd around me, it didnt seem tightly crowded...it was more as if all of the space had been taken up, yet there was no tension. noone pushed into anyone else, they just seemed to flow around each other in a way that was closer to a liquid than i had ever seen a group of about 100,000 humans act. in my mind, these people were beginning to encompass a visualization such as the spiecies of tree that connect their roots underground...but at ground level, just seem to be completely different organisms. there was almost no need for anyone to speak. there was a communication on a unanymous level that even someone at a complete outside perspective could sense strongly. at about 6:00 i averted my attention down to the ground. where the grass had been trampled by thousands of people the straw laying over the dirt began to move and mosaic into a beautiful pattern that seemed symetrical yet creative on every level of my being as i absorbed myself in its magnificence. my conciousness moved like an observer come to life, and when something interesting caught my attention, the observer followed it as if it was being tangibly pulled in that direction. and so a buzzing distraction in my mind demanded attention. i quickly realized that it was just part of me that wanted to see the sky. so i looked up out of my developing ground world through the layer of liquid people and straight out into the heavens. it was about 8:00 by now and the sun was setting in an intensly vibrant shapeshifting view that seemed to open my soul until i could feel one with the universe. i could feel...as if tangibly...that my senses were diffusing into one another and that my whole inner universe and body was diffusing into the whole of the outer universe. i began thinking about what my old line of pereseptions felt like. i had almost forgot id lived my whole life in a systmatic, 'normal' world and felt sad. 'i cannot beleive i couldnt grasp that this world even existed before now.' (at this point, the concept of 'now' felt actually quite alien to the truth) as i began to fold back to earth i asked my brother with a grin on my face, if he could stop smiling. we both stood still and twisted our lips superficially to try and frown then burst out in laughter not 3 seconds later. a little while later, my soul diffused into the music again.
751	2	a	by about 1:00 in the morning, as willy nelson and the dead bowed to the giant cheering sea of color, people, and the sweet musk of hashish that filled the air, i breathed out a sigh and my chest seemed to collapse back in forever, as if the whole experience was one breath of holy understanding. i guess the theme that seemed to umbrella the entirity of the trip was that understanding in itself has lead directly to the thing being understood, and if there is any other inhibitive emotion, then there is something left to be grasped. i thought this right at the end of the concert when walked away aching with pleasure as id been standing for about 13 hours strait and my face hurt from smiling for so long!
