      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "Setting: a small two room apartment that was habitated by my friend N and his girlfriend D. The apartment has a kitchen and living room that are basically connected with a bedroom door in the living room, a bathroom door in the kitchen. There is a bird in the apartment as well, I believe a parakeet.\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "Two of my friends had recently gone to a college for the weekend and returned with the nicest looking magic mushrooms I had ever seen. They didn't know the species, but the bags contained only caps, no stems. The 1/8 that I got was one giant wrinkly cap with golden sparkles in it. It was a bluish-grey color with earth tone highlights. This was during the time period that I was getting substantial quantities of acid, including UFO tabs and a bottle of Liquid Lavender. N and D, whose apartment we used for the trip, had never done acid. D decided to try some, N decided to stick to mushrooms for the night. My friend (and former girlfriend) S came with me, as we all had gone to high school together (though I didn't really know N or D until college). S and D took just acid, N took mushrooms, and D and I took acid and mushrooms together.\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "T+0: I drop a hit of liquid acid and eat the 1/8 of mushrooms at the same time. We're playing Dreamcast and generally relaxing at this point. N rolls us a nice blunt with the amazing hydro-chronic that we got for the night. I am excited about the evening, though still I feel some slight trepidation as I have never mixed acid and mushrooms or taken quite such a large dose as I plan to.\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "T+1: The effects hit us all at different times, but by now it would be fair to say we're all under the influence. S, D, and I each take a UFO tab. \r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "I can't really recall what happened for some of the next period of the trip. I remember being in the next apartment from where N and D live talking to some very sketchy guys about ecstasy and how much it should cost. The whole scene over there was no good for my head so I went back to the other apartment to talk to S and drop another hit of liquid. We decide it would be a good idea to put on the Dark Side of the Moon and the Wizard of Oz (perfect tripping combination, whether the synergy was intentional or not on the part of Pink Floyd). \r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "T+3 or 4: The movie is in progress at this point, maybe halfway through and things are getting weird. D keeps saying she is fine, then bursting into tears. We try to comfort her, which makes her laugh and then cry again. This cycle is repeated many times over the night. S spends a portion of time in the bathroom staring at the tiles. I keep telling myself I am close to sober, perhaps as a defensive reaction against the huge amount of psychedelics zipping around in my brain. My trip is definitely pronounced, but visuals are slight and the sort of 'mental clusterfuck' associated with tripping out doesn't seem that bad. However, my senses are definitely not normal, I believe that I am perceiving 'hidden' information in the auras of objects and people. \r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "T+5 (or 6, but I'll stop second guessing now): We decide to go on a walk to when the movie is over, but not before having a massive smoke session. Things are becoming stranger by the second, and from the looks of my companions I am not the only one noticing this. Interpersonal dynamics at this point are quite amicable, as they usually are, but there is another level of openness that I do not usually encounter with other people. Dropping another UFO tab, me and S go outside first. Several minutes later N and D descend the long set of stairs and begin walking with us. At one point N says he feels like he is floating in outerspace. I look down at the sidewalk and all I can see is the blacktop, which looks like the cold distances between the galaxies.. I feel adrift in the universe. This feeling eventually gives way to a sensation of warm liquid running down my legs, and I feel like my skin is melting into blood. This sensation has returned in subsequent trips, but is not usually disturbing only odd. \r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "T+7: Walking around the park for what seemed like years we observed a midnight ice skating event (it was still a little shy of midnight at this point, we had dosed early). We sat and watched small children and their parents having simple and unencumbered fun. The experience fills me with a sense of longing to create and nurture life, but luckily I do not run out and impregnate anyone.\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "T+8: Upon returning to the apartment we notice that the music has been playing the whole time we were gone, though not at a very loud volume. Instead of turning it off we pop in Alice in Wonderland and leave the movie muted. I watched the same movie with sound on my first acid trip and this helped to anchor me into a continuum of experiences that I had begun with that life-changing psychedelic event. My trip became very mental and introspective at this point, though startingly clear considering the drugs I took. S became wrapped up in the movie, identifying with Alice to the point of becoming quite upset when the movie was paused at one point. \r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "T+10: Some time after the movie is over we are playing videogames and talking in general. The trip has levelled off for all of us, though not subsided. We smoked some more pot, which helped stir up some of the trip but mainly just had a calming effect. I notice that I am profoundly tired around this time.\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "T+13: It is the early morning hours as we smoke a final bowl laced with a small chunk of opium I had been saving. N and D retire to their bedroom to catch some sleep. S and I continue talking intermittently as we lay on a folded out sleeper couch. I drifted off to sleep at one point only to be awakened by the parakeet who landed on my head. I remember being confused and slightly frightened by this disturbance, and it took me a little while to fall back asleep. S was sleeping soundly by this point. \r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "We all slept pretty late. I was awakened by D coming out of her bedroom in the midafternoon. S had already left to go back to her college. I walked back to my building which was about 10 minutes away, feeling a definite afterglow that manifested in the form of contentment and that familiar 'burned' feeling most acid-heads can tell you about. I slept pretty good that night and layed around like a waste all Sunday. By Monday I was pretty much back to normal, though a little fuzzy headed. \r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "One interesting thing to note is the effect of psychedelics on animals. I don't mean we gave the parakeet any drugs (that would be pretty inexcusable, actually), but the bird still seemed to be able to perceive a noticable difference in us, even without us acting out any of the psychic turbulence. I have long believed that animals are very in tune to nonverbal communications of emotion through smell, body posture, etc. The bird very clearly knew something was up, because it seemed semi-agitated for much of the trip. This fact made me feel bad at several points as I didn't want to be contributing to the anxiety of another creature. Still, it would be interesting to see how a higher mammal such as an ape would react to seeing humans on acid or another psychedelic.\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "\r",
      "<BR>\n",
      "All in all, this trip was a mind bender, but in a subtle sort of way. A lot of the personal issues and ideas that were raised in this trip were a continuation of previous ones, and some of them continued into future trips, illustrating the cumulative nature of psychedelic excursions as explained in the philosophy behind psycholytic therapy (repeated ingestion of relatively low doses of acid for psychotherapeutic purposes).<!-- End Body -->\n",

      "Set: feeling relatively confident about my ability to deal with hallucinogenic drugs after a series of eye opening and mind expanding adventures in cosmic consciousness. Happy to finally get to the weekend after a long week of college.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting: a small two room apartment that was habitated by my friend N and his girlfriend D. The apartment has a kitchen and living room that are basically connected with a bedroom door in the living room, a bathroom door in the kitchen. There is a bird in the apartment as well, I believe a parakeet.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Two of my friends had recently gone to a college for the weekend and returned with the nicest looking magic mushrooms I had ever seen. They didn't know the species, but the bags contained only caps, no stems. The 1/8 that I got was one giant wrinkly cap with golden sparkles in it. It was a bluish-grey color with earth tone highlights. This was during the time period that I was getting substantial quantities of acid, including UFO tabs and a bottle of Liquid Lavender. N and D, whose apartment we used for the trip, had never done acid. D decided to try some, N decided to stick to mushrooms for the night. My friend (and former girlfriend) S came with me, as we all had gone to high school together (though I didn't really know N or D until college). S and D took just acid, N took mushrooms, and D and I took acid and mushrooms together.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "T+0: I drop a hit of liquid acid and eat the 1/8 of mushrooms at the same time. We're playing Dreamcast and generally relaxing at this point. N rolls us a nice blunt with the amazing hydro-chronic that we got for the night. I am excited about the evening, though still I feel some slight trepidation as I have never mixed acid and mushrooms or taken quite such a large dose as I plan to.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "T+1: The effects hit us all at different times, but by now it would be fair to say we're all under the influence. S, D, and I each take a UFO tab. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't really recall what happened for some of the next period of the trip. I remember being in the next apartment from where N and D live talking to some very sketchy guys about ecstasy and how much it should cost. The whole scene over there was no good for my head so I went back to the other apartment to talk to S and drop another hit of liquid. We decide it would be a good idea to put on the Dark Side of the Moon and the Wizard of Oz (perfect tripping combination, whether the synergy was intentional or not on the part of Pink Floyd). \r\n",
      "\n",
      "T+3 or 4: The movie is in progress at this point, maybe halfway through and things are getting weird. D keeps saying she is fine, then bursting into tears. We try to comfort her, which makes her laugh and then cry again. This cycle is repeated many times over the night. S spends a portion of time in the bathroom staring at the tiles. I keep telling myself I am close to sober, perhaps as a defensive reaction against the huge amount of psychedelics zipping around in my brain. My trip is definitely pronounced, but visuals are slight and the sort of 'mental clusterfuck' associated with tripping out doesn't seem that bad. However, my senses are definitely not normal, I believe that I am perceiving 'hidden' information in the auras of objects and people. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "T+5 (or 6, but I'll stop second guessing now): We decide to go on a walk to when the movie is over, but not before having a massive smoke session. Things are becoming stranger by the second, and from the looks of my companions I am not the only one noticing this. Interpersonal dynamics at this point are quite amicable, as they usually are, but there is another level of openness that I do not usually encounter with other people. Dropping another UFO tab, me and S go outside first. Several minutes later N and D descend the long set of stairs and begin walking with us. At one point N says he feels like he is floating in outerspace. I look down at the sidewalk and all I can see is the blacktop, which looks like the cold distances between the galaxies.. I feel adrift in the universe. This feeling eventually gives way to a sensation of warm liquid running down my legs, and I feel like my skin is melting into blood. This sensation has returned in subsequent trips, but is not usually disturbing only odd. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "T+7: Walking around the park for what seemed like years we observed a midnight ice skating event (it was still a little shy of midnight at this point, we had dosed early). We sat and watched small children and their parents having simple and unencumbered fun. The experience fills me with a sense of longing to create and nurture life, but luckily I do not run out and impregnate anyone.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "T+8: Upon returning to the apartment we notice that the music has been playing the whole time we were gone, though not at a very loud volume. Instead of turning it off we pop in Alice in Wonderland and leave the movie muted. I watched the same movie with sound on my first acid trip and this helped to anchor me into a continuum of experiences that I had begun with that life-changing psychedelic event. My trip became very mental and introspective at this point, though startingly clear considering the drugs I took. S became wrapped up in the movie, identifying with Alice to the point of becoming quite upset when the movie was paused at one point. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "T+10: Some time after the movie is over we are playing videogames and talking in general. The trip has levelled off for all of us, though not subsided. We smoked some more pot, which helped stir up some of the trip but mainly just had a calming effect. I notice that I am profoundly tired around this time.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "T+13: It is the early morning hours as we smoke a final bowl laced with a small chunk of opium I had been saving. N and D retire to their bedroom to catch some sleep. S and I continue talking intermittently as we lay on a folded out sleeper couch. I drifted off to sleep at one point only to be awakened by the parakeet who landed on my head. I remember being confused and slightly frightened by this disturbance, and it took me a little while to fall back asleep. S was sleeping soundly by this point. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "We all slept pretty late. I was awakened by D coming out of her bedroom in the midafternoon. S had already left to go back to her college. I walked back to my building which was about 10 minutes away, feeling a definite afterglow that manifested in the form of contentment and that familiar 'burned' feeling most acid-heads can tell you about. I slept pretty good that night and layed around like a waste all Sunday. By Monday I was pretty much back to normal, though a little fuzzy headed. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "One interesting thing to note is the effect of psychedelics on animals. I don't mean we gave the parakeet any drugs (that would be pretty inexcusable, actually), but the bird still seemed to be able to perceive a noticable difference in us, even without us acting out any of the psychic turbulence. I have long believed that animals are very in tune to nonverbal communications of emotion through smell, body posture, etc. The bird very clearly knew something was up, because it seemed semi-agitated for much of the trip. This fact made me feel bad at several points as I didn't want to be contributing to the anxiety of another creature. Still, it would be interesting to see how a higher mammal such as an ape would react to seeing humans on acid or another psychedelic.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, this trip was a mind bender, but in a subtle sort of way. A lot of the personal issues and ideas that were raised in this trip were a continuation of previous ones, and some of them continued into future trips, illustrating the cumulative nature of psychedelic excursions as explained in the philosophy behind psycholytic therapy (repeated ingestion of relatively low doses of acid for psychotherapeutic purposes).\n",

      "I have learned from experience that mushroom trips rarely, if ever, end up congruent to pre-trip expectations.  Prime example:  when two good friends and I reached the incredibly beautiful Jolama Beach campsite on a secluded piece of the Pacific Coast with plans to put our respective eights of mush madness to good use, I never expected that only a few short hours from then I would be hanging precariously from a cliff of crumbling rock and screaming desperately to my friends that I didnt want to die. But such is the nature of psychedelics.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "The trip started out fine:  we were lucky to get a campsite at all, considering the high demand of any campsites in the Santa Barbara area during the annual Fiesta Week.  We had put ourselves on the waiting list the previous day and were incredibly excited to get one of the few remaining camp spots.  We set up our tent and had good music ready for our post-mush return. A single backpack full of essentials was all that was brought with us on our trip; it contained peanut butter, spoon, pipe case, metal joint-holding tin, a lighter, the mushrooms of course, and my friend Matts 1969 steel Nikon camera. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "We made our way down the beach and did not hesitate to break into the shrooms.  Right before our intake, Matt expressed fear about what we were going to do, hinting to his uncertainty about this shroom trip, recalling past trips where he had gotten especially negative and had almost reached a snapping point. We reassured him and vowed that this was going to be nothing but positive energy.  A secluded spot behind a jutting cliff of rock concealed our illegal activities, namely eating our eights with peanut butter and lighting up our last remaining, and therefore appropriately fatty, road trip joint.  We vowed to not bring any time telling devices, wanting the experience to stand as it was, free of the worry and constraints of time.  After the J was finished we began running up the waterline of the beach, reveling in pre-trip expectation and excitement. After awhile I realized that I couldnt feel my legs as they pounded into the soft sand of the beautiful beach. We slowed down a little as the shrooms really started to take effect, antsy excitement replaced with dawning reverence and amazement.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "A swim seemed prudent, so I stripped down to my boxers (my other friends, using appropriate foresight, had been wearing swim-compatible shorts) and we made our way into the shallow waves.  Matt and I elected to go deeper than Seth was willing to and we ended up in near-shore breaking waves that completely engulfed us. Time in the water was floating in perpetual ecstasy, lulled by the gentle swell of the waves and sometimes, when we ventured further out, the violent crash of a breaking wave. Back to dry land, trying our towelless best to dry off.  We made an adventure out of the experience then, seeing how far along the beach we could make it, adventurous marines on a parading journey of beach conquest.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "The mushrooms effect was only increasing:  I realized that these shrooms were much stronger than the ones that I had been getting the few prior trips. I was amazed by the beauty of the scenery, sun shimmering on the water, beautiful beach and cliff running along the water for as far as I could see.  I kept gesticulating in all encompassing sweeps of the arm at the beauty that was almost too much for me. Look at that sky!  Can you believe that goddamn sky!  How can we possibly deserve that? I asked several times. Eventually, I felt I needed to just lay in the sand and lose it like I have only lost it once before:  it was time to shirk language and constructive conscious thought, to revel in my mad mindset and explore the maniacal realm of ego loss.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, this is exactly the time that Seth decided he needed to climb a cliff.  He explained to Matt and me that he wanted to be above it, above all of this beauty. I have to explain to readers that Im pretty damn scared of heights and a shitty climber to boot, so this didnt seem like a very good idea to me.  Matt laughed at Seths idea, then began outlining various scenarios in which someone attempting to climb the cliff would plummet to the jagged rocks below and bash out their brains on them, so I wasnt exactly reassured when Seth urged us to come with him and Matt agreed. I, of course, had to follow, not wanting to be (1) left deserted on the beach with no one else and (2) some sort of group pariah too scared to commit to a group challenge and risk. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Seths sticklike figure scampered easily up the first part of the cliff face with no real difficulty, making it to the first plateau. Matt, too, was a good climber, and I followed his quick pace up the cliff, not really thinking about what I was doing.  It wasnt until I came to a nearly vertical part of the climb that I managed to realize what the hell I was doing and exactly how high up I was.  I was shaken but continued to climb until a large chunk of rock came off in one of my hands.  This scared me incredibly, and I realized that the rock I was climbing was not stable, was damn far from it in fact.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt, I called out, I cant climb anymore man.  This fucking rock is coming off on me! Matt tried to reassure me, to talk me through the climb, but the fact was I couldnt do it. I could vividly see my death, and Matts words of brain bashing kept ringing through my head.  I could imagine headlines and newspapers explaining how a bunch of crazy tweaked out kids thought how fun it would be to climb rocks and stupidly plummeted to their deaths.  I felt like a weak, lame loser with no heart to overcome my fears. This plus Matts positive verbal walkthrough of the climb helped me to muster the courage to, step-by-step, pull-by-pull make my way to the plateau. By then Seth had already reached the top.  We continued to climb again, this time Matt spotting me in case I had any trouble.  The last 10 feet of the climb were the worst for me.  I was covered in dirt and dust that had cascaded down the rock, temporarily blinding me.  A large piece of rock came off in my hand and Matt had to steady me or I would have fallen. Dirt and mud had assailed me, worms crawling around in the stuff hitting my face and getting in my mouth.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, finally I made it to the top, to blessed stable horizontal ground. Now it was Matts turn to make the final climb and I could imagine his death just as vividly as mine.  However, he made it up rather easily with my help and we three stood triumphant on top of the cliff that we had conquered.  How joyous it was!  I was a dirty, disgusting looking disheveled mess but I felt so damn good about the climb and overcoming my fear that I just didnt give a damn.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "We walked along the cliff back towards the campsite, enjoying the view and freedom of our elevated height.  Eventually, we found an easy climb down the cliffs near the campsite and started to make our trek back down the beach towards the spot where we had left our backpack. I saw an old hippy looking man sitting in the sand with his dog enjoying the sunset.  I realized I must have looked like a mess, but he didnt seem to mind and neither did I.  Seth and Matt kept remarking on how dirty I looked, so I took a swim, this time not bothering to take off my khaki shorts.  We began to make our way to the camp and this is when I slipped into my first really negative shroom experience.  For some reason I was certain that a boat sailing in the distance was watching us somehow, a police boat waiting for us to do something that we could be arrested for. I insisted on leaving the pipe case underneath some rocks and sand, it being the only illegal thing that we had brought with us that we hadnt consumed. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "It took awhile, but my friends convinced me I was only being paranoid.  I felt a little better about the situation, but extreme paranoia overcame me again when we talked with the hippy looking guy and for a second I almost believed that he was some sort of undercover police figure.  Once again my paranoia had to be talked down and I felt like an asshole for being so dumb.  I could tell my friends, especially Seth, were getting tired of reassuring me like I was a helpless child.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "We made our way into the camp and I was forced to wash up in the bathroom since the showers only accepted quarters and I only had bills. In the bathroom I confronted my own stupidity, weakness, and paranoia and really came down on myself hard, way too hard. My feelings of weakness from the climb returned threefold, all traces of pride and happiness from the mild accomplishment destroyed.  I washed up and changed clothes, at least finally feeling in control of my personal facilities, yet still feeling really down. When I got back to our site, Matt and Seth were making preparations for sleep, any idea of going back into SB to party drowned in exhaustion. I was almost completely down from the shrooms, but apparently Matt and Seth still had a ways to go.  Matt layed in his sleeping bag moaning to himself while Blackalicious boomed out of our small cd player and the strange, soft, and compelling voice of the urban poet Cleopatra entranced us and probably weirded out our fellow campers, only a mere 5 feet away from us on either side. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Seth began laughing softly to himself, and then loudly.  This continued for minutes and minutes, and had to definitely be either pissing off or scaring, or both, our fellow campers quiet little conversation circles around their tidy little fires.  Matt was getting a little annoyed, and so was I for that matter.  Matt felt uncomfortable and the psychological stuff was really hitting him hard, as I learned later.  He talked about how he was never going to do shrooms again, and how we were all acting like a both of hopeless maniacs.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the blue, Seth quit his laughing, leapt to his feet, and said, Im leaving. He only made it as far as three feet outside, however, when he collapsed back into the tent, laughing even more.  He told me later that he was planning on roaming the world from then on, that when he said Im leaving he really meant that he was leaving forever.  Matt left the tent then for a walk, and I was torn as to what to do. Leave Matt alone, or Seth?  I decided that I would accompany Matt, as he was actually detaching himself from our property and wandering the campsite alone.  I caught up with him and we made our way to lay on the beach, amazed by the incredible star filled sky above us, impossibly beautiful.  I had never seen a sky like it before, and that wasnt the shrooms either, it was simply breathtaking.  I still had minor, minor visuals, such as certain stars swirling or dancing, but the psychological stuff was all gone.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt and I shared our thoughts and conclusions from the trip like we generally do after such an experience.  I reflected on my momentary moment of weakness, a little ashamed by it but glad that it was such a slap in the face as to what actually could happen to me when dealing with shrooms, experience with psychedelics aside.  It started getting a little cold so we made our way back to the tent.  Seth was quiet when we go there but after about ten seconds of silence he said hey guys, Ive found enlightenment and continued laughing like a madman. He was a little more under control, and I even managed to talk to him a little bit later about what he was thinking, and his continued mushroom trip, continuing hours after mine despite the fact that he didnt consume his entire eighth. The man is incredibly sensitive to the stuff, Ive learned.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, thats about it.  I drifted off to sleep content with my experience, knowing I learned a valuable lesson of my own fragile psyche, but disappointed that my untimely paranoia interfered with what otherwise wouldve been a great time. This lesson helped me six days later, when I took the plunge with five grams of the stuff.  What utter great madness!\n",

      "It was near the end of the summer after my senior year of college, and I had important decisions about life to make:  whether to stay around school and risk getting tied down or to move West and bum around for a while.  It was one of my last weekends with my friends from school, and I was faced with the ire of saying 'Have a good life' to dozens of my closest friends.  Still, I had a positive outlook about life, and I was having a shitload of fun just existing cut off from my parents, working and supporting myself for the first time.  After a summer of trying futilely to get away and do some drugs with friends, my friend Syph snagged some shrooms.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "We found a weekend to go up to a cabin owned by our university.  It was myself, two of my best friends from college (Syph and Clock), and a really good friend I had gotten to know well that summer (Sugar).  A mutual friend of everyone came up with us to enjoy nature and ended up being our sitter (Dummer).\r\n",
      "\n",
      "After arriving late at night, we waited until the next afternoon to eat them.  There was a threat of some showers in the morning, but by lunch the skies were blue, warm, and sunny.  We were hoping to catch some stars at the tail end of it eating them at around 4:00, but we had to be leaving that night for a 2 hour drive, and just before 2:00 my friend Clock said 'We're wasting a beautiful afternoon.  Let's go.'\r\n",
      "\n",
      "We divvied up the shrooms, an eighth each.  Everyone ate 2/3 to 3/4 of their dose then.  We got our stuff together, and played frisbee for a while in the sun.  The onset was very quick - within ten or fifteen minutes me and Sugar got a slight stoned feeling.  It could have just been a beauty high, though, because it was so gorgeous out, and we were up in the mountains on a perfect summer day.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "It's difficult now to remember what happened the next half-hour.  We had decided beforehand to go to an area of the river where there was a stone beach and some boulders and rapids to wade across.  When we got there, there were some families in the water, and we just didn't feel good about it as a setting.  We decided after some confused looking around to go up the river to another place, where there were fewer people, but more rocks and ledges to jump off of into the river.  I was a leery about having all that dangerous terrain to deal with, but we had little choice.  The spot was a ten minute walk, and the skin on my legs was starting to feel that creepy crawly feeling I get at the beginning of trips.  I practically ran leading everyone to the new spot through the woods, it felt like a race against my mind to get there before I got too high to find my way.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "We finally got to the rocks, (+0:40) which were catching so much sun now.  We laid our towels down on one of them.  I laid out a quilt that my grandmother had made me before I went to college, it was hundreds of squares of a full spectrum of colors, and I was hoping it would be interesting to have while tripping.  I had no idea.  I immediately ran for the ledges that overlooked the river; I had been here many times before and I wanted to get one jump into the river before the drugs hit too hard.  I went up to the ledges, where a half-dozen teenagers were daring each other to jump.  I stepped off naturally, felt the cold sting of the water -- all quite natural sensations.  Getting out of the water, I went up to the ledge with Syph and Sugar, with Dummer (the sitter).  We sat at the top in the sun, looking into the water.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "The teenagers were still there, and we started off talking reasonably enough, but after a half-hour or so our discussion was wandering into weird territory.  My mind started wandering around, analyzing the fact that we were starting to act high in front of strangers yet nobody felt able to move, or staring at nothing for a while.  Clock eventually joined us.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I was looking down at the water, assuming the first visuals would come from the ripples in the water.  It was only when I looked away from the water that I saw them (in fact, I didn't get any visuals from the water beyond occasional tracers the entire trip).  By this time (+1:15) I was beginning to appreciate beauty, and the scene I was in was overwhelming me with it:  The sound of whooshing cars on a highway above, trees lining the banks, a mountain river flowing by 20 feet below our dangling feet, a warm breeze blowing cumulus clouds into creampuffs as it coursed over the mountains and up our valley.  Even though were out of direct sight of the beach, I could hear children playing around the river bend, I could smell pine tar in the air.  I looked down into the endless detail of the granite around me, and it was strewn with pine needles in random, yet orderly positions on the ground.  It was like looking at a fractal, and the needles started to flow, as if drawn by strange attractors all over the 3-dimensional surface of the rock.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Syph said, 'look at those clouds' right about then, and Dina was transfixed to a cliff face across the river with her mouth wide open. All this time, sitting on the ledge, I had been thinking about jumping off again, since I had warmed up sitting in the sun.  We were all noticing that we were getting some weird looks from the teenagers, but everyone was too rocked by the drug's onset to go back to our towels, a three-minute walk over uneven rocks.  I decided to by-pass the whole issue by jumping in again -- it was only a minute or so by swimming, and I wanted to jump again anyway.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "It was awesome!  The drug was well into the upswing by now (+1:40?), and the fall was a freeze-framed instant that was jolted away only by the cold of the water closing over my head.  I found quickly that I could still swim fine, and went to the top.  On the way up from the depths, I notice an awareness change.  I usually stayed out of the darker deep reaches of this river, just for a fear of the blackness and rocks down there.  As I was under, I noticed a beautiful green glow of the sun coming through the water, and felt very nice about being here.  Just for a split second, though, I may not have even realized its importance at that time.  I treaded water until I started getting tired, then headed for the rocks.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I came out onto a small boulder.  It was covered in bird droppings, which ran in white streaks as the water from my trunks hit them and ran down the rock.  I stood, transfixed by the chalky trickles below me, and watched them absorb into the rocks and run across them for a long time.  My friends had started slowly coming back from the ledge, and Syph stopped on the same rock, watching the water bugs swarm across the still water at the river bank.  I began exploring the rock area, walking into a secluded gully and seeing a rock that looked like a viper leer ominously at me.  I stepped on it, and watched lichens on rocks, or patterns in granite, or the trees and cliffs across the way.  It was as if I was looking for a door, a stimulus to throw the trip wide open.  I think at this point I was beginning to peel back the layers guarding the subconscious.  I was having fun, but there were no cathartic feelings at that point.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I had planned to eat the last of my portion when I began to peak, and I sat down on my grandmother's quilt to eat them, with Dina and Clock doing the same.  We smoked a j, and I was babbling about something when Clock said '91, what's the difference between the first and second jump?'  You see, I have a theory about the relative altruism of people who jump off cliffs into water that I had told Clock about after my first jump.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well,' I said, 'The first jump is completely chemical-induced.  Your brain sends out messages craving adrenaline, and seeing a safe way to attain it here.  It's like, 'I've got to jump!'  Now, the second jump,' I continued, 'is for the love.  You've got your adrenaline fix, you are already refreshed, now it's like 'I love to jump!' '  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Clock paused for a second or two (~+2:30), then looked up thoughtfully, saying 'So what's the third jump all about?' \r\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, I don't know -- guess it's ... I never thought of it ... ' I said.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "'Maybe you should find out,' said Syph.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I was driven.  I had found my door, although I didn't know it at the time.  All I felt was a pull to the ledge.  It didn't stop me from exploring a bit on the way, but I got to the cliff top in only a few minutes.  There was a crowd of normal 20-something people up there now.  I hesitated, not liking the looks of this and knowing I should probably go back down out of sight, but I had to know what the third jump was all about.  I stepped up to the edge, but there was a line forming, and I had to get in line.  I imagine the look on my face was a cross of intense curiosity and social fear.  I didn't like this one bit, but I had to jump that third time.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I sailed through the air on a cushion, hitting the water only feet away from the guy who went before me.  I stayed under for a second longer, going a little deeper and letting myself float in the muffled, chilling aqua.  I swam into the middle of the river, out of the shadows of the shore, and let myself sink down.  It got colder and darker, but a meter or so down everything became a wavey, deep cyan.  I felt like a womb, only so much colder.  I felt like I was protected completely and exclusively down here, only the sound of the rushing river around me.  I was perfectly isolated.  I could feel the heat of the sparkling sunlight, even though the water around me was only 65 degrees.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I reached a Nexus.  The minute I felt it, I realized I had only felt this nexus once before, the first time I shroomed one afternoon on the Gulf of  Mexico with the sun blazing and the surf breaking at our feet, I had lived a lifetime with a beautiful, bronze, young, and hot trip buddy.  I was there again, but I was too happy to analyze it; I was home once again.  I think it's something with me about the wetness, the texture of the water, the muffled sounds of a crowd or the underwater world, the warmth of the sun, and maybe the touch of human flesh that brings feelings of absolute comfort and content because of the tactile similarities to the womb.  And every time I came up for air, it felt like I was being reborn.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The water was getting cold, and I swam to the opposite shore.  There was a little outcrop of chair sized rocks, and nobody else there.  I knew that this was the perfect place to explore now that I was peaking (~+2:50).  I plastered my cold body against the biggest flat rock, feeling the cold leave my skin.  The sunlight dancing across the little wavelet tops made everything in my view sparkly, and the ledge I had just jumped down from (for the third time) was beginning to take the shape of a frog.   Across the water, I watched my friends.  Syph was perched on the birdshit rock, contemplating waterbugs.  Sugar was wandering in the woods down different paths, and Clock was still milling around the bags in his usual fidgety fashion.  Dummer was a rock downriver from them laying flat in the sun, attempting to take a light nap underneath the sunny skies.  A sparrow flew by overhead, and I watched it go, so fast that it left a streak that went off into infinity.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "You can imagine my joy when I found a wallet washed up on the rocks.  This was perfect!  All these things about a person, in this case little Timothy H.  I went through his cards:  A junior high student ID, a gun club membership card, and some other stuff.  I yelled to Syph about the wallet.  He called out, 'Is there any money in it?'  It hadn't even occurred to me to look.  The true treasure was the mind trip of finding out stuff about a total stranger's life.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Syph was holding up a bowl with my weed in it, and even though it tore me to leave my secret exploring place, I didn't want them to smoke it without me.  I slowly waded out into the now-frigid waters.  I went under a couple times, but it was too cold and I had to keep my head above water most of the way.  I pulled myself out of the water still glowing from my experiences in the water and across the river,  and we all smoked the bowl of kind.  I began hiking toward the ledge, but it must've taken me half an hour to get there, with all the detours I took for exploring little nooks of the woods.  I sat on the back side of it, looking down the path I had come up.  I wanted to jump again, but I was too cold, so I sat in the sun.  Sugar joined me, then Syph and Clock.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "There was only one local left, a 27ish woman on the other side of the ledge.  She appeared to be waiting for her boyfriend, who was swimming.  We talked about her cursorily because she looked at us very long and weird, like she knew something was wrong with the picture, but didn't know what and didn't care to ask.  We all told each other what we had seen, and I was talking about the ledge turning into a frog, and the vipor rock.  I began to feel very megalomaniacal, like I was in control suddenly.  I said 'my mind can do anything right now!'  Clock told me to move the bridge that we could see down the river.  I couldn't do it right away, but sure enough the next time I looked at it, it was stretching towards me.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Syph has a very squishy nose, and he often makes people feel it just to understand its level of mushiness.  We have rules when tripping -- no touching, no splashing, no following, no fucking around with anyone.  I announced that I wanted to break the rule to touch Syph's nose, and he was fine with that.  As I smushed the cartilage mass down,  his facial features suddenly sprouted.  He has very heavy brows, a big nose, and a large jaw.  I looked at him, and all those features grew out in relief.  Everyone else was looking at him, and we started laughing at Syph's face.  Syph was also laughing.  Clock said, 'Syph, you're kinda weird looking, huh?'\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Syph was kind of weird looking, but he had once been called one of the 10 sexiest guys in America on some newsgroup poll, so it wasn't a bad weird.  But now, he just looked very Neatheral-ish.  I told him so, but not in a bad way.  Everyone laughed, we had a group laugh, prompting another look from the girl.  It startled us to remember she was there.   'Oh, I forgot she was there,' said Syph.  I said, 'Oh, I saw her before.'  'We all saw her before,' said Clock, 'we just forgot.'  Indeed , we had completely forgotten.  I looked down at Dummer, who was a smallish figure sprawed on the rock 50 yards downriver.  I stared at him, and tried to make the rock swallow him.  Not out of malice, but just because it was fun to do.  It began to bubble up around him, and seemed to vaporize at the edges and begin to waft over him like a cloudy lens or a slight gray fog.  Then, he and the rock turned into sharp shapes, and degenerated into a paint-by numbers, with Dummer just a few tan slivers in the whole gray jumble of the rocks.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat for a while longer, but the sun was now shaded, and I felt like I wasn't in the place I wanted to be.  I went back to the bags, put on a turtleneck, and found a notepad and pen in someone's bag.  I sat down and looked out over the water, all alone on the rock.  I sat on my grandmother's quilt, and it just seemed so comfortable and warm, I didn't ever want to leave.  I began to flash back to my first trip, on a Florida beach.  I saw the blazing sun, the eons of waves in front of my disembodied legs, my trip buddy's smooth bronze body next to me.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I curled up under the quilt, the light showing through it, engulfing my world in every color of square.  I felt a distinct red warmth come over me, and a comfort that was just like the best feelings of family.  And I wanted to go into the water, but it was too cold.  I just started writing:\r\n",
      "\n",
      "'That nexus.  The water keeps calling me back.  It was like a womb ... a cold womb ---- aqua, the light playing above ---- I felt so perfect.'  Looking at the pad now, the handwriting goes from scratchy, and becomes more and more flowing until it is almost cursive, 'Like I was part of the water.  I want to be there again.  Like on the Gulf of Mexico with the sun so HOT, then cold.'  The handwriting suddenly becomes very straight, yet messy; almost maniacal, I remember feeling intense feelings of sexuality here, 'And Koala there ------ like a dune of bronze flesh just rising out in so perfect a beachscape, saying 'NOW IT'S PERFECT.''  This was an intense flashback to my first trip, but it ends just as abruptly, in once again flowing handwriting:  'Like the water.  I want to go in the water again.'  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing ends here, because I ran off my little rock into the water at this point (~+3:30).  The cold could be damned, this was where I had to be.  I swam into the middle, and I promised myself not to come out because of simple cold.  It was not exploratory like the last time, this fourth jump.  I was mature, it was coming back to an old friend, it was rebirth.  I swam around in an intense state of euphoria, shrieking with audible pleasure every time I came up for air, screaming underwater from a core of contentedness that was so much better than the forced happiness of MDMA.  I swam and swam, letting myself sink into the black, floating on my back as the sun warmed my stomach and face.  I began feeling megalomania, yelling back to my friends that I could pitch a no-hitter right now (like Doc Ellis).  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was treading there, I realized that the river and the blanket were the two fighting parts of my life -- the blanket was trying to hold me back to home, the water was like the cold, but wonderful, sting of a new start.  I yelled out, 'I'm torn between nostalgia and rebirth!' to anyone who was around to listen.  It was everything I had felt for the last year in a sentence.  That calmed me down a bit, but I couldn't leave the water yet.  I went near the opposite shore, looking at the little secret place I had found, shivering violently.  I had been in the water so long that I couldn't feel my feet or control the shivering.  My friends were getting concerned, and I felt like I had proved to myself that I was willing to put up with hardship to find new horizons.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I returned to my bag (~+4:30), putting on the warm clothes I had brought.  I wrapped myself in the quilt, feeling that it no longer conflicted with my desires.  I took out the pad of paper, and began to write again.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "'In our bodies we took refuge curled up in a sea of time ---- no, curled up against a sea of time.  \r\n",
      "So hard\r\n",
      "So wonderful\r\n",
      "like all these blessed rebirths today.  So wonderful to have just ... passed these ages together.  These long, desperate journeys between.'  I looked up at my friends, because that line was meant for them.  They were up on the ledge again, looking out at the water and the sky.  I wanted very much to share the rest of the trip with them, but every time I had travelled the same path up the ledge that day, it had taken me so much time because I was distracted by different sights along the way.  The discovery process that had been so fun at the beginning of the trip was now seeming daunting.  I wanted to be there, but I didn't want to go there, and it was another life metaphor suddenly, as I wrote:  'Like twilight for the soul.  We start out craving the journey, but we end up regretting its distractions.  We haven't the energy to try out new things any more.'  This last sentence was written in a desperately quick scribble, because it was so upsetting I just wanted to be done with it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I started walking back to the ledge with the notebook in hand.  I didn't avoid the sights along the way, but noticed that they were all familiar.  I had passed these spots so many times that day, the visions they produced were like old friends.  I stopped to say 'hi,'  but I didn't need to spend the time meeting them all over again.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I got up to the ledge and sat with my friends.  We were all beginning to come down now.  While most people hate the denouement of the mushroom trip, I've always enjoyed it.  We sat there, talking about our trips and watching the sunset reflect off the clouds.  Mostly, though, we just sat there silently, smoking a bowl or two to deal with the comedown and enjoying the tracers that were coming out of the colors of sunset and the flocks of geese flying by.  I said to them, 'I'm going to miss you guys.'  I meant it like I had meant few things in my life.  I felt a tear streak down my cheek, and wiped it away quickly.  It wasn't a tear of sadness, I was quite content at the moment.  It was just a little outlet of all the emotion that had coursed through my body all that day.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "We walked back to the cabin in the graying twilight (~+6:00).  I was horribly cracked out, and the kind bud wasn't helping.  I was more tired than I could ever remember being.  Other people staying at the cabin had started a fire, and I just sat by that, still off baseline, looking up at the stars from the confines of my own little world.  It would take 15 hours of sleep to get back to baseline after that trip, but it was worth every bit of it.  The insight that I gained on that trip has been with me ever since.\n",

      "This was my first heroic dose experience. I've had LSD and mushrooms 2 or 3 times times each, but usually half a tab or max. 2 gr. Of shrooms. I always enjoyed it: the optimistic and lighthearted mood was very welcomed when I was going to depressive phases, and with friends we would get into quite deep conversations really fast, critically analyzing our past, or I would love to spend time in nature - where I would feel almost overwhelmed by the beauty of every little detail. Never had too intense visuals, just the general trembling and breaking of edges of things, sometimes in rainbow-illuminated fractals.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Other drug usage: \r\n",
      "Weed for ~5 yrs, almost daily in the last 3 months. I have ~6 months phases of not smoking at all and alternating with phases of smoking almost daily.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "MDMA/ecstasy more heavily since summer 2017, on average a session/month. I feel MD definitely contributed to uplifting my mood in the winter months, even after and in between sessions. Did not experience downcomes almost at all, which I credit to using good quality MD and trying to stick to a regimen of vitamins and rest before and after a sesh.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Motivation\r\n",
      "I had gotten interested in the heroic dose experience as a means to dive deeper into myself. I'm quite an introspective person, and I felt that it could help me make sense of all the things I was going through at this time in life. I thought it might help 'catch' all my scattered thoughts and bring them intro a more coherent conclusion, which I found very difficult to do sober or on other drugs and was making me feel quite stuck. (I know meditation might help here, but alas, I lack discipline. Working on that) \r\n",
      "At the same time, I believe in all sacredness of beings, including plants and fungi, so I approached this adventure humbly, with respect and trying to prepare myself for whatever they could reveal to me, as opposed to going in with a self-centered idea of what *I* could get from this.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparation:\r\n",
      "I wanted to make sure I had minimized all chances of having a bad trip and make the most out of it. I had been thinking about taking this trip for the last 5 months. The opportunity did not come, but in all this time I had already started thinking of my goals and what I would like to clarify for myself, and this process already happened just in the anticipation of the trip. I had already started thinking of my goals and what I would like to clarify for myself, and this process already happened just in the anticipation of the trip. Being more mindful in self-care, meditation and having very honest and emotional conversations with my close friends, travelling and getting out of my context for 3 weeks before this for sure also helped this process. I think of this as mental preparation.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "For my personal feeling of safety, I chose to have my long-term partner as a sitter. We discussed what my needs might be and what do I want him to do, how much do I want him to interact with me, etc. We agreed I will ask for help if needed, and he would check up on me if I seemed distressed from the outside.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Synchronicity had it that the day both me and my sitter could synchronise before the new moon on Feb 15th,  turned out to be the 14th. I find it beautiful and ironic that I ended up taking what I will dub a ''self-love trip' on valentines, while my partner was watching, considering we are going through a process of detaching from each other and unlearning toxic relationship patterns, and we both don't give a shit's ass about Vday anyway.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I cleaned my room and burned some palo santo and we mounted a black blanket on the window - the room was not pitch black, but good enough. I closed my phone. I had not eaten that day, my last meal was a dinner at 8 PM the day before. I prepared myself 4 or 5 short joints, in case I needed to chill down, and Salvia officinalis tea for clarity. I had water on hand in a few corners of the room and I instructed my partner to keep some sweets at hands in case my blood sugar levels would drop (I've fainted before in situations of fasting combined with physical activity and/or smoking). I kept reminding myself to use breathing techniques to let go if anything became too much, and instructed my partner to remind me to try chanting if I would get in a bad place. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "THE Trip\r\n",
      "I took 6gr of mushrooms at exactly 11 AM. Psilocybe cubensis, 2gr of Amazonica strain, 4gr McKennaii, both homegrown from a trusted source and gently dried. They were stored in the freezer for ~6 months. I proceeded to sit in lotus position comfortably in my bed, closed my eyes and tried to meditate, being very attentive to the sensations in my body. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "After just 15 min, I asked my partner how much time had passed because I was already feeling my auditive sensitivity increasing. There was a hum or a buzzing, almost like radio static but it did not feel mechanical, I heard it as being quite organic. I believe this is what others might have called ''the cosmic hum''.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "In what felt like quite a little while since that, the audio and visual hallucinations started becoming much more intense, so much that I had to lie down on my back. I was flooded with a feeling of love and well-being. The visuals were something between kaleidoscopic fragmentations of color and shapes, or fractals, all gently moving and swirling and pulsating. I barely felt where the edges of my blanket or my own body ended and where these shaped began, they seemed to flow from one another and I felt wrapped, enveloped in it, and it was a very pleasant feeling. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "By this point, the audio part was comprised of the cosmic hum I could barely hear over my main narrator voice, my other voices, other people/entities voices and electronic music I've been listening to in the last weeks booming in the background. The music part triggered movement in my body, as I had just recently gotten into dancing for hours at parties and am enjoying it immensely. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I also felt I wasn't alone. Every now and then I would become aware of my partner's breathing or a sound he made, although he was very quiet, or of other people going about their day in our apartment and in those moment I felt super sober and could register these with clarity. But at the same time, there were moments when I knew I was in my own world right then, right there in my bed, and some sort of entities were there with me. I was thinking about so many things at the same time, and my narrator's voice was very clear in my head, but it wasn't my only voice. If I would think about people in my life, I might see them or remember scenes and analyze them and talk about the situations with these people at the same time, but I felt the presence also of people I've never met, people I admire, etc.  Most notably, and I made note to write this down even in my trip, at one point many of the wisdoms I had came to were recited to me in the voice of Erykah Badu. Priceless moment there, really. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "But it felt like there were other ''entities'' around me that I didn't know. They did not necessarily all have a form, but I felt their presence. Some might just be the inside of a swirl from a corner of what I was seeing, but they were just as present there as myself. It felt as if I am in some sort of gathering, but all were in good mood, laughing and being very understanding with me and each other. There was only love and understanding really. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "A big chunk of this experience I've felt as very sexual. The not feeling alone part also played into this, but I didn't necessarily imagine a sex scene with someone/s, more like I felt caught in what seemed to be a very erotic dance with all these entities, and every now and then we were 'spotted' by outsiders, so we would all giggle and amaze ourselves at how nice and unapologetically beautiful we all are, and then continue. There was a great deal of understanding also in terms of consent and not pressuring any entity into anything, so what was happening felt all the more authentic and I felt all the more grateful and comfortable.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was riding in this trip for a while, chasing around my thoughts and just bathing in all the feelings, trying to draw some conclusions out of everything. At some point, I felt decidedly less stimulated and proceeded to come out of my world deliberately and try to sense what was going on in the room. I proceeded to open my eyes slowly, trying to notice if I still had visuals, but in the semi-darkness of the room, it seemed to have calmed down. I saw my partner was almost sleeping on the couch, and I finally opened my eyes for real. It was eerie, I was very conscious of what just happened and everything was fine and normal, but at the same time the feeling of returning to my room after this experience was just... Eerie. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it was around 2:30, 3 PM when I stood up to go to the bathroom a second time. There were still the breaking edges if I focused a little but more on one point, but it was much weaker. By this time I concluded the trip was over, even if I had remains of feelings from it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical reality:\r\n",
      "During all this time I was lying in my bed, clutching my blanket at times and twisting underneath it. I kept my eyes closed for almost all of the trip, except the times I had to get up to go to the bathroom. I went from being ok to being cold, to sweating, to mild cold sweat and then feeling ok again. I was crying for most of it because I couldn't contain the feeling of joy, but also smiling, laughing or softly moaning. My partner thought I had fallen asleep at one point as I was lying almost still and breathing deeply, but there was an incredible amount of things going on in my head actually. And every time things became a bit too much (even if it was all on the positive side), I proceeded to take deep breaths and try to relax with every exhale, which worked beautifully. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "At maybe an hour, hour and a half after ingestion, I needed to use the bathroom for the first time. I felt this need for a while before I managed to express it, but not because I couldn't say it. I wanted to go, and I believed I could, but I felt I was near the peak already and very self-conscious about how others might perceive me. This led to delaying the moment I asked my partner to please have a look if the bathroom is free (although I felt my hearing was extremely accurate, I thought I couldn't trust all the sounds I heard because I couldn't pinpoint their spatial origin as good as when sober - a thump in the kitchen, for example, seemed eerily not really coming from there, even if the sound was very familiar). When I finally tried to get up and asked, he promptly told me it's free and there's just one of my flatmates in his room. I came to the edge of the bed, stood up pretty fast, got a bit dizzy when upright but he caught me and I started walking. Here's where synchronicity is as funny as always, because my flatmate came out of his room at exactly the same time as I came out, so I said hi, we hugged (or I kinda fell on his chest) and then I excused myself. I must have seemed just sleepy or that I've been crying. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "While I finally relieved myself, I notice just how strong the visuals are when I look on the tile floor and every tiny strand of hair is moving, fluctuating, ondulating and separating into its own edges. Then I notice our black cat was also in the bathroom and I locked her in with me, which is weird because she's very fast to get out and this normally distresses her. She was pretty calm and waited for me to finish and let her out. Lol.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I was still very aware of everything going on in the flat. My mate had people over, they cooked and I could hear their conversations, but I was very decidedly in a different place. Their voice intermingled with everything that was going on into my head and just seemed to complement the ideas I was getting to. But I felt so acutely hypersensitive and self-conscious I was keeping an ''eye'' on that reality also so that when I needed to go to the bathroom again I could do it and try not to bump into anyone.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "After going a second time at about 2:30 PM, I smoked a joint and tried to start talking to my partner, but was greatly hit by the poorness of words to describe to him all I've felt, and I think I needed about another hour at least until I really started talking. The fact that this is the cliche associated with the heroic dose experience did not make it easier.\r\n",
      "\n",
      " I was feeling a lot of tensions in my muscles, especially neck, shoulders between shoulder blades and had to eat a piece of bread after 2 puffs of the joint because I instantly felt my blood sugar drop. Over the next hours, we ate a real meal, drank more tea and smoked all the joints, trying to talk as best as I could in the meantime. I felt writing might be a better option.\r\n",

      "The incredibly uplifting feeling has stayed with me, I was feeling quite optimistic, much more light-hearted, I would giggle and laugh with my partner at things that maybe before would have annoyed me, and the general feeling of openness in myself was quite intense still. I didn't feel it was the ''mushroom'' giggles I would normally get even if I was probably still high in the afternoon, but that it was something that came from a deeper place in myself.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, shortly after my partner left I felt the need to open my phone to see the time and have some sort of grounding with the real world. It was 6 PM and exactly 8h ago he was messaging me that he is on his way. I proceeded to smoke for the rest of the evening and try to process and take notes. I smoked much more than I usually would in an evening, but I felt the calming and numbing effects of weed pleasant I smoked much more than I usually would in an evening, but I felt the calming and numbing effects of weed pleasant, as everything was still too clear, too crisp and I felt my senses were much too acute for reality if I wasn't smoking. I couldn't take very bright lights or listen to music yet, but by 9 PM I was able to pay some bills online and other things that required concentration which I normally couldn't if I'd been smoking that much. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I fell asleep at about midnight from the weed high and awoke not very rested because of this. Reality seems more crisp and eerie the following day, and I feel spaced-out.\r\n",

      "Lessons learned may come in plant metaphors...\r\n",
      "\n",
      "T. McKenna's point that psychedelics 'only work on intelligent people' because they have to work with whatever you are feeding your mind resonated with me a lot of the experience. I was feeling like the trip just reinforced some truths I already had in myself, but couldn't articulate as clearly or manage to live by them on a day-to-day basis, when questioned by people who felt differently than myself. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel this is where there might be the critical point, as raised by my partner, that perhaps such an experience is just ''trapping'' you in your own bubble of beliefs if the feeling is of reinforcement, much like facebook algorithms trap you in a bubble of information that you already agree to. But what makes me have conflicting feelings about this is that so many persons report strikingly similar ''revelations'' after such an experience. I've read reports of people coming to terms with the idea of death and thus feeling overwhelmed by the miracle that is life, that we are all alive, or of realizing this ''we'' includes so much more than our mind can comprehend. There comes with this an understanding of change as inevitable, and in many cases than a feeling of detachment from problems that might have seemed insurmountable until then. Others report a dissolving of the ego. Of course, just the fact that I have read about these experiences could have predisposed me to have the same kind of conclusions.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "During the trip, at some point, I realized: 'but of course, I'm thinking about everything I've read and realized in the last period because this drug acts like a mirror'. So, of course, there is your self-reflected, but since the visuals are fragmented, I started seeing it more as a double mirror, where an endless reflection and folding upon itself is formed. So it is not as if I am trapped in my bubble of thoughts and ideas, but it allows me to see myself from behind also, and in infinitely more faded cliches at that. I still see myself from my own perspective, but it is a richer one nonetheless, as somehow all the corners of the broken image reveal me corners of my mind I couldn't see clearly before. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Another realization was that the cliche, the reflexion, the less-than-the-real-thing is so tricky and pervasive, that we've grown accustomed to prefer the cliches instead of the real thing in our day to day reality. I think this might be the reason I feel trapped in a very grey and faded reality in my life in the days following this experience. But the general feeling I'm left with is of understanding, compassion, and love. A greater understanding of the people around me, and especially in their weaker moments, but also of myself. It seems self-evident to a new level that when we are not able to take care of ourselves and thus, of each other, we become weaker versions of ourselves, prone to make even more unhealthier choices. And so a greater compassion for beings everywhere, who are all just struggling to be. Plant metaphors associated were the growing of a weed in a parking lot compared to one in a lush environment, the individual manifestations of deprivement on plants - the drying of leaves, the burning from too much heat, the way a tree will enclose the wound of a cut branch, and many more. It seemed to me plants have this insatiable desire to keep being, to grow, that I found truly inspirational.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Another poignant feeling during the trip was being incredibly overwhelmed at the miracle of life, and how even in the most adverse conditions most of us continue to go about in our lives. Wishing I could show these images of growth and wonder to all the people around me who are dealing with fear and anxiety and seem stuck in their lives, not daring to move almost. I felt that I too had such a stuck moment, but I want to drag others with me in overcoming this. There was an intense desire in me to nourish those around me, to make sure they get what they need to reach full bloom.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also left with a renewed trust that people can overcome their heteronormative socialization and experience closeness and affection in a variety of ways and from a variety of sources without falling prey to the usual feelings of abandonment, frustration or possessivity. It's also been my experience just recently by practicing relationship anarchy, but I seemed to notice instances of this more after re-analyzing some past situations.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, the final and beautiful image I was left with was that we are all connected, every being with every little imperfection in its mightiness, and the connection I visualized was a growing mycelium in disturbed earth, branching out and connecting and sustaining even more beings at once. \r\n",

      "I'd like to share this experience that was quite different from the previous ones. I am usually very reluctant interacting with sober people when Im tripping and like to stay in close proximity to a safe spot. This time however, I walked far away from my tripping base and did that on a busy hiking trail full of sober hikers. Strangely, these hikers helped me to have one of the most insightful, philosophical trips I ever had.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "About me:\r\n",
      "I am a male in my mid-forties, not married, no kids, am living in Europe and am somewhat, but not overly, experienced with psychedelics (mushrooms, salvia, LSD, 2C-somethings, MDMA, BZP - approx. 50 trips within the last 20 years & smoke weed on a daily basis). Mushrooms have always been my favorite substance. I tripped on very high doses in the past, experienced pure bliss and had to weather-out demanding, believe-shattering journeys. Three years ago, I quit my quite demanding job as an aeronautics engineer in order to study full time at the philosophical faculty. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Set: First week of semester after an exhaustive term break where I worked long hours for two months. A little bit insecure, but relaxed.\r\n",
      "Setting: Beautiful little cottage very close to a lake, surrounded by marshland. Mid-September.\r\n",
      "Dosage: 3.5 g psilocybe cubensis, mixed strains (McKenna; Mazatapec; PES Hawaii) \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Preface\r\n",
      "My ex-girlfriend and me rented the cottage some months ago. It is almost always booked so we rented it, regardless that the lectures started in this very week. Unfortunately, we split a month or so before the rental, so I ended up being there on my own. It is a rather small and simple bungalow, beautifully located directly at the border of a lake, surrounded by marshland,  heated by a wood stove, and the next public transportation is approximately 3 km (2 miles) away. Not having a car, this was somewhat inconvenient for getting there and from university, but great for privacy, especially during the night (for theres a popular hiking trail right behind the bungalow, only shielded-off by a hedge). There is another cottage of a similar type close by, approximately 70 meters away, both patios are in sight of each other.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday I moved in and enjoyed the solitude very much as a contrast to the never ending noise and hustle of the city center where I live. I planned to trip on shrooms during my stay already at the time of renting the cottage, and cherished the freedom of just having time to decide when. Some three years ago, I had started cultivating mushrooms and developed my own variation of straw-coffee ground-technique Some three years ago, I had started cultivating mushrooms and developed my own variation of straw-coffee ground-technique that is simple and works surprisingly well. It turned into a nice hobby but eventually, I had to stop because there were simply way too much shrooms to be consumed (without fearing to lose ones marbles) and I did not want to sell it. I thought that I may give it a shot right on arrival but then the people in the neighboring house were having some kind of family gathering, there were people coming and going and greeting each other enthusiastically, which bothered me slightly, so I thought I may wait for after the weekend for tripping. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "The Day\r\n",
      "So I waited till Thursday. The night before, I had a friend over. We had a great night with deep talks, laughter and reflection. She had to go to work early and drove me to the next gas station where I got some orange juice and sweets, just in case I wanted some treats during my journey. After a walking back to the cottage, I smoked a joint and slept for another five hours or so. It was a gorgeous day, end of September, two full days without any commitments - it felt right to trip. \r\n",

      "I weighed out 3.5 g of psilocybe cubensis. I formulated three issues I wanted to explore during the trip (1. decision-making in general; 2. how to deal with my ex-girlfriend; how to deal with the huge expected work-load at university). I chewed the shrooms, washed them down with orange juice and smoked another joint to ease the come-up. I considered it to be a rather low dose since they just laid around for more than two years, one year of it exposed to light. It turned out, the weakened potency was no issue at all. \r\n",

      "After some thirty minutes, I felt the first, steadily increasing effects. One of the harshest come-ups in my tripping career so far. I couldnt get comfortable regardless what I tried, was freezing and sweating at the same time but surprisingly, there was almost no anxiety. At least for this first phase. I laid in my bed and masturbated twice (sorry for being so explicit) and with each orgasm, the beginning trip changed its shade, making me believe that the very uncomfortable come-up phase was finally over. \r\n",

      "+ 1:00 (13:20)  A Rough Come-Up\r\n",
      "But the uneasiness kept increasing up to a point where I had to get out of bed. I just felt down, it felt like there was neither a place nor a destiny for me in this world. I started pacing back and forth through the three rooms of cabin (a good procedure for difficult times on psychedelics) and without realizing it for some time, I got into a strange thought loop. The thing with this though loop was that not only the same sequence of thoughts repeated (well, its a loop) with every pacing-through-the-cabin round, but the emotions increased with every cycle too. They were not necessarily bad, but heavy, serious and a little dark. I eventually called it panic loop, not because it was a loop of panic, but I believed that this was the mechanism to how people get anxiety or panic attacks. Having the same emotionally-loaded thoughts over and over again and each cycle starts from a higher level of emotions because the previous one added some. Not the best thought when tripping. However, this pattern kept coming and going during the whole trip. I longed to go outside and sit by the lake, for the weather was great but my neighbors were sitting outside with some friends. I had no wish that they see me in this state, being sweaty, agitated and clearly not in a mentally healthy state. So I kept wandering around inside the cabin until I realized that I needed to leave the house to get out of the loop and decided to walk on the busy trail  if only for a few minutes. It took me another fifteen minutes to get my trousers on because ironically, the plan to escape the loop had become a part of the panic loop itself. I kept forgetting that I needed my pants in the middle room and remembered it again every time I reached the adjacent room where my trousers were. This entire pacing phase lasted for about an hour.\r\n",

      "+ 2:00 (14:20)  Crossroad to the Psychedelic World\r\n",
      "I finally managed to concentrate long enough to grab my pants and get them on. As I sat down to put the shoes on, out of nothing, the walls bulged immensely and got a strange translucent green-red visual echo like having a bad reception on an old color tv. Now I was anxious! I just couldnt believe how strong the mushroom was coming on and feared that I may be in for a very intensive, maybe too intensive trip with no place to feel comfortable. I pushed that thought away, with it (surprisingly) went the visuals and I stumbled out on the trail. From now on, I may not get the sequence of the events in the exact order, but in general it fits.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was walking, the anxiety vanished almost immediately. But it was replaced by self-accusations. I thought how stupid I am to still be doing mushrooms. I asked myself what I want from the mushroom what he has not shown me already and it is on me to act accordingly instead of being lazy and keeping asking him again. I remembered somebody quoting Alan Watts that one shall hang up when having received the call from psychedelics. I thought that I am having a weak psyche and I need my mental strength to keep my things together (strangely, I was thinking this in English) when Im sober, so using psychedelics is just dumb. Not that I was scared to loose or damage my mind, I just felt way too exhausted for a heavy trip full of wonder and confusion. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as I was crossing a small bridge, a colorful completely psychedelic world unfolded in front of my inner eye, ready to take me over. I didnt hallucinate. It was like a dream-picture was superimposed on (the left side of) my regular view or the image that is processed in the brain. It was a Kokopelli-like figure, playing silently some kind of flute while dancing in a bouncing, off-beat psytrance style in a world of dark green and dark red pattern that reminded me remotely of scallop shells (one side a smooth round contour, the other jagged). It felt like a yielding path, to be travelled on ones own discretion. I honestly and boldly refused the idea to go to the psychedelic world and dissolve and I was very relieved, almost excited that I was offered the chance to decide.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "+ 2:10 (14:30)  The Philosophical Walk\r\n",
      "And I was right, the psychedelic world retreated and within the next hour or so, I slowly came to terms with my trip. This was the trip to end all trips, at least for me. The last trip and I should humbly experience it and reflect about it while doing so, like somebody who had just had his last day at work before retirement and closes-off the door for good. Thoughts raced through my mind, each one formed new, unexpected connections with another one and with itself. It was not a thinking process, they connected by themselves at an incredible speed. And it seemed each thought was accompanied, yet somehow merged with an adequate emotion. I believed/knew it was my duty to go through all emotions and to bring the thoughts into the world of human knowledge. To formulate, to apply concepts on the connections and dependencies that unfolded themselves. For the sake of just having them thought, for entering them in a morphic field. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the trail had become quite busy, there was a group of people, lets say, every 5 minutes. Mostly retired couples or young mothers with their kids, all friendly, caring for each other and in good spirits. Usually, I try to avoid other people as much as I can while tripping. But this time, all the friendly faces and loving vibes and the fact that I had to greet them somehow kept me on the right track, literally. Time stretched unbelievably. I know this trail very well and couldnt believe that I only covered a bend of maybe 10 m (30 feet) while I went through what felt like a dozen thoughts and mood swings. The trip was still gaining momentum and for a brief moment, I feared that I may be overwhelmed, not be able to move and make a fool of myself. But somehow, I knew that everything was going to be o.k. when I just kept walking and fulfilling my duty. I was still walking on that sunny, busy trail. From time to time I was sucked into the panic loops. But I was able to draw myself out of it, thanks to the friendly hikers (thank you!). One of the panic loops was actually very inspiring and gave the trip a new turn.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The thought loop revolved around second thoughts about walking away so far away from my safe spot and a slight fear of sliding into a bad trip, asking myself what a bad trip is and what it is caused by. I concluded that it could only be ones mind or ones self that makes a trip bad and I was scared to spend the next few hours under the regime of my own self, realizing that this is pretty fucked-up, yet dangerous fear, for we can never escape ourselves (nor should we!). I then asked myself whether it was a good idea to walk so far... and the loop started again, but with more intensity and speed. As soon as I realized that Im in a loop again, I left it with ease. But the questions, what makes a mind a mind, what makes me me stuck and became the main theme of the trip. the questions, what makes a mind a mind, what makes me me stuck and became the main theme of the trip. \n",
      "\n",
      "I came to the realization that the very core of consciousness is the ability to name things, it is the unit of thoughts (like: oh theres a flower!). And to do that, one needs to do two things: to differentiate and to generalize. To differentiate to set them apart (lets say: a flower from a stone). To generalize to make assumptions, predictions and statements (The flowers wont be there in winter.). Differentiations can only be done by assigning properties to them (The flowers are colorful, temperature-sensitive organic beings. Stones are grey, mineral things.). Generalization is then done along the properties (Flowers are all things that are colorful, organic beings.) Assuming, that theres no natural order or set of properties made for mankind by nature, we also had to define the properties (Color is if it looks like when you look at a forest in autumn compared to when its fog.). I was puzzled because to define properties, one needs already a concept of things (or how would you know what a forest or fog is). I really thought thats the big mystery and the godly nature of mankind that we make the decision to structure. To say: this is this color and that is not. And that it is amazing that we all come to pretty much the same set of reality. I remember that a friend of mine told me about the concept of constructivism and I think it merged with the first few pages of Terrence McKennas Foods of the Gods which I read recently and the classes in political economy that Im taking. But how all the inputs synthesized almost by themselves and in such a high rate was truly amazing.\r\n",

      "During all this time, I was walking on the trail that was getting busier and busier. There was a constant, intense stream of thoughts like the one about constructivism that required all my mental power. I wonder if I looked strange or tweaking during this phase. The people I kept greeting (a habit in the rural parts of the country where I live) did not seem to be bothered. I even was joking with a young mother with her one year old and I remember her laughing with me. However, after approximately one hour, I had to go past the water club Im member of since Im a child. Up to three months before, I had a leading position in the club, so I knew I had to greet everybody I would see  something I did not exactly feel fit for. There was an event going on, there were people all over the place, all dressed-up in the same sports gear and setting a dragon boat up. I hesitated but decided to walk past quick and planned to pretend to hurry on to a train (the station was now not far away). Strangely, I recognized nobody, so I kept on walking towards the station, bought some water (realizing how hard Im tripping while trying to make sense of my purse and coins) and walked a few minutes to sit at the border of the lake. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while, I desperately needed to pee and headed back to the boat house. It seemed to be empty, none of the guys from before were there and it seemed safe to have a leak. There I met F., a girl that is competing for the Olympics and I chit-chatted a little bit about training sessions and how she manages to train three times a day and work at the same time. It was surprisingly easy to talk even though, I was still tripping pretty hard. It seemed that whenever my brain was not in overdrive pondering existential ontological questions, the visuals took over. There was this red-green echo-shadow superimposed on her but my talk seemed to be pretty coherent (I even told her a week later about my state then and ask, if I acted strangely. She said, I was perfectly normal.). Then another guy I knew, who rents out the dragon boats, arrived and told me that the guys I saw earlier were the police corps of the town where Im now living (that is some 40 km / 25 miles away). I joked, that they dont have to pursue me across county borders for my occasional weed consumption, and Id better leave. But just as I went upstairs the door burst open and I found myself in front of twenty police guys, all having this distinct super healthy, short-hair, eager-alert look. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought it would be a good idea to go to the bathroom in order to prevent unnecessary contact but they were all heading to the toilet as well. I found this hilarious standing beside these swat-team-like guys while the toilet bowl morphed, changing color from red to green constantly. I finished, rushed out, shook my head in disbelieve and decided to made my way back home. I knew it will take me an solid hour to walk and I started to feel that I was coming down, anticipating the great afterglow that always comes with shrooms.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "+ 4:30 (16:50)  The Way Back\r\n",
      "I felt a little bit exhausted, sweaty and pale, there were still thoughts, ideas and questions running through my brain, but at a slower rate and less intensity. I pondered on the way people make decisions and how that is an almost godly act. And that one should decide with joy and a positive curiosity. And that to not decide is a cowardly act. The sun was getting lower and set the surrounding marshland and board of the lake in a soft, autumn light. I felt at one with the world, clear but still under the influence of the mushroom. Some half kilometer ( a third of a mile) short of the cottage I climbed a look-out, smoked a cigarette. The marsh and the lake looked just beautiful in the autumn light, and so was life.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "+ 5:30 (17:50)  Coming Home\r\n",
      "After having arrived home, I smoked another joint, that brought the mushroomy feeling a little bit back. But an hour later, I felt back to baseline. My ex-girlfriend had texted while I was on my walk, asking if she can come to visit me. I was happy to hear that, picked her up some hours later and we did not talk much about our relationship and just enjoyed the calm setting. I worried a little bit that all the revelations during that trip might be lost, for around midnight it felt somewhat like I had not tripped.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The weeks after\r\n",
      "This was actually a baseless fear. For the next few weeks, I was having small déjà-vues on strings of thoughts or ideas that I had during the walk, and then followed these strings again or tried to reconstruct them. I enjoy walking way more now and opt to walk instead of taking public transportation more frequently. For me, it was one of the most philosophical and inspiring trips and I think I got an answer to the main question - the one on decisions. The effect felt was almost double of what I expected considering the dose and age of the mushrooms, but it was just perfect.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "From my point of view, the mushroom has indeed an magical component. It gives one what one needs and has a strong and determined way to do that. \r\n",

      "My Illness(es). \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I am 38 years old and have suffered from major depressive disorder for nearly all my adult life. My depression is characterized as treatment resistant (recalcitrant), in that despite taking a wide variety of antidepressants and taking part in a variety of other therapies over the years, I am not cured. I have a family history of this general type of depression. My depression is not in the category of bi-polar or schizoaffective disorder. I also have a low level anxiety from time to time, though this is much less debilitating than the depression itself. My depression is not the 'winter blues' (SAD - seasonal affective disorder), though I do live in a northern State.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently therapy-wise, I have gone to general professional counseling. I year or two ago I went to a class in Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), and started practicing that on and off. I exercise approximately 3 times per week. I eat moderately healthy (which means moderately unhealthy too). I drink alcohol regularly, perhaps 0 to 3 beers per day. I drink approximately 2 cups of coffee per day. I also pray and meditate in the Christian religious tradition. The most recent prescription meds I have taken are Gabapentin, Lamotrigine (Lamictal), and Escitalopram (Lexapro), though in the last 4 months I have only been on the latter two of these. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue I have along with my depression (co-morbid with it) is chronic lower back pain. I have been to many many doctors and tried a variety of therapies, remedies and medications. I mention this because often chronic physical pain tag teams with more mental/behavioral health issues, as is the case with me. (From about 2001 to 2003 I was also on a opioid (Kadian) for my back pain.) It would take a book to record all the treatments, therapies, remedies and medications I have partaken for the lower back pain. I have been to acupuncturists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, neurologists, massage therapists, accu-pressure, sub perceptual electro stim, reiki therapy, faith healers, have gotten ex-rays, cortisone shots, CAT scans, MRIs, etc. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "It should also be known that I lead a rather normal, 'boring' life.  I am married with no children, and a cat. I work full time one on one with an adult with autism in a home setting. I did my share of pot and shrooms in college, but have not partaken in either for about 15 years. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this year I watched the documentary, Neurons to Nirvana on Netflix, and was very impressed. I then read an amazing booked called The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide, by James Fadiman. I also did some reading about the recent resurgence of psychedelic medicinal research around the world, and its potential for such varied maladies as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, OCD, helping terminal cancer patients with the anxiety involved in their impending death, major depressive disorder, etc. (The cancer study was done at Johns Hopkins, the top medical school/center in the US.)\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 2. \r\n",
      "Decisions to Go Forward, and Prep for Therapy (Set and Setting). \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent a considerable amount of time pondering, journaling and even praying about whether to self administer a psychedelic medicinally. I spent a considerable amount of time pondering, journaling and even praying about whether to self administer a psychedelic medicinally. I also spent a good amount of time talking through the pros and cons and potentials and details with my wonderful wife. She is always good at cutting through the bull and bringing me down to reality when I run to the latest impulsive idea or crazy fad. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I also spent countless hours online reading the unofficial anecdotes and 'research' of countless people seeking cures from everything from cluster headaches to allergies, and reading their experiences, both successful and not successful. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I did and do very purposefully think of this whole possible experiment as therapy, so I have used those words, as opposed to recreation trip, or spiritual entheogenic voyage. Not that I judge the legitimacy of these uses. I only say this to show that my personal goal has been to embark on this experiment for medical and behavioral health purposes. The mushrooms I took in college were for recreation, and I don't regret this. Yet, this time around, nearly 20 years later, my focus was healing - and going outside the mainstream medical route was only because that route had yielded only limited results. Meaning I had already tried the first line of therapies and remedies, and was only using this as a last result, so to speak. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I prayed to my Higher Power about it, the acceptability of this venture, and came to the conclusion that I was not violating my conscience or religion by this medicinal usage. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked into the possible counter indications and safety considerations and concluded that I was not in any danger (such as from being on medications which would make therapy unsafe, or having a family history or behavioral diagnosis which would make therapy unsafe). For example, I am not on Lithium or a MAOI or Tricyclics. Nor had I had any suicidal thoughts or tendencies. Nor did I, as Fadiman states, have 'desire to look deep into the darkness or into the nature of evil'. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "My conclusion was that there was significant potential in psychedelic therapy, but was careful to tell myself that it would be unlikely to be a miracle cure or magic bullet, which cures everything completely. Whether in the realm of politics, social problems, illness, disease, or behavior issues, rarely if ever does a complex problem have a simple solution. I am reminded of a magnet on a friend's fridge which says, ''For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.' - H.L. Mencken'.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "With that disclaimer, I did and still do see psychedelic therapy as a relevant piece of the mental health puzzle. For some, perhaps a small piece, for others a larger piece, but a relevant piece to consider either way. This means I believe psychedelic therapy alone is unlikely to work if not accompanied by other puzzle pieces. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I determined that my wife would not be the best guide (just like it is not generally wise to have a loved one operate on you). I chose a close friend, - a warm, trusting individual, who happened not only to share my faith tradition, but was sympathetic to this unorthodox type of therapy. He had also long ago taken mushrooms himself, which Fadiman recommends. My friend was also intimately acquainted with my issues and depression, and knew empathetically my plight and lack of success in mainstream medicine and therapy. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "For location I chose my home, and centrally my living room. I used many of the suggestions of Fadiman's book, including pre-arranged musical selections - all of which did not have vocals. It was mainly Bach's cello arrangements, some Mozart, orchestral, The Passion of the Christ soundtrack, as well as some relaxation/meditation CDs. I got a bucket ready - in case of puking. I had ample fresh water, a blanket, and arranged 3 comfortable locations to sit or lie down. The house was free of distractions or anyone else but my guide. (I did however let the cat roam free.) A previous house guest had put blankets over some of our extensive window for sleeping, and I kept those up, but the room still had natural light. I got a few carefully selected pictures of myself and some loved ones ready. I got a small mirror ready. I have numerous plants in the house, but I still bought fresh flowers. I got eye shades ready. I turned off my phone and actually put it in a draw in another part of the house. I instructed my guide not to used his phone either. I also instructed him to bring reading material.  He was to mainly keep silent and just be a comforting presence, not necessary to ask questions, or dialogue with. In this way he was more like a 'sitter' than Fadiman's definition of a 'guide'. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I did significant journaling in the week prior to focus my attention on what I desired to accomplish, and what I wanted to think about in therapy. Yet, I was well aware that despite all the prep and desired focus in the world, things may turn in unexpected directions. I desired to focus on my depression, my anxiety, my low self image, my marriage, my job, my insecurities, my back pain. I also asked God (my Higher Power as I understand it) to reveal himself to me, reveal his love to me, to give me love for him, give me love for others, and to show me his presence. But ultimately, I knew my mind and my Higher Power would take me where they wanted regardless of my hopes and desires.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the various psychedelic options, mushrooms seemed the best choice for me personally for the following reasons.\r\n",
      "- Mushrooms are a naturally occurring substance in nature. \r\n",
      "- I could grow my own, and thus insure purity for safety reasons.\r\n",
      "- Mushrooms work primarily on serotonin receptors, as opposed to LSD for example, which works on both serotonin and dopamine receptors. \r\n",
      "- It is recorded that there are less adverse experiences with mushrooms, than say for LSD. \r\n",
      "- A therapeutic mushroom 'trip' is significantly shorter than for example LSD.\r\n",

      "The following was done with consultation with my wonderful wife.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I concluded that Lamotrigine/Lamictal (LAM) 50mg would not affect my therapy one way or another, but that Escitalopram/Lexapro (LEX) 30mg would significantly reduce the therapy's effectiveness. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "8 days before therapy, I therefore went down to 1/3 of my LEX dose, and then 5 days prior went off LEX completely.  I stayed on my full dosage of LAM however. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "The after therapy, I concluded to go back onto LEX but at 10mg (1/3 the previous dosage). This would help to gauge whether in 3 or 6 months the therapy had any lasting effect to counteract my depression.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 4. \r\n",
      "Cultivating Mushrooms for the Medicine. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been so long since college I actually didn't know anyone who could get me this medicine. I even asked a coworker to no avail!  I then concluded that it would be safest anyway to cultivate it on my own, because I would be sure it was real and nothing dangerous was added to it. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning about cultivation took a great deal of online reading over the course of a few months followed by some trial and error. Overall I followed a combination of two or three beginners cultivation instructions (TEKs). I used a pre-made starter substrate kit, used a strain of  P. Cub, used a shotgun chamber, and kept a cultivation journal. I ended up with no contamination, despite my wife telling me on a number of occasions that I was not being sterile/clean enough.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all the cultivation was quite fun.  Sort of a like an intense short term hobby.  And I was able to easily get more than enough mushrooms to take as medicine. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 5. \r\n",
      "Dosage. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that using home grown mushrooms as medicine cannot be an exact science since every mushroom will have a slightly different amount of the active chemical compound (psilocybin) despite identical dry weight, even taking into account different growing conditions, different strains, different species, etc. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked back into the common therapeutic dosages back in the early research years of the 1950s and early 60s.  I also looked into the modern research dosages, particularly those used in the Johns Hopkins cancer/anxiety research. In this latter research, in addition to the control groups given a placebo, there were two levels of therapeutic dosage - 20mg and 30mg pure psilocybin. I read that statistically significant benefits were reached at both dosages, however (perhaps obviously), more benefit was realized with the higher dose, but also slightly more negative side effects. I therefore aimed for this high medicinal dosage equivalent. (If I had never done mushrooms before I may have opted for a somewhat lesser dosage.) \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Now as I said, there is no exact science in converting an exact medicinal dosage of the psilocybin compound into the bone-dry mushrooms.  But assuming that my species and strain was typical, I assumed 30mg was equal to 5g bone-dry.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Part 6.\r\n",
      "Ingestion. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "The therapeutic plan was to take the medicine in the morning. I was sure to get a good night's sleep the night before. I also cut down significantly on my caffeine intake in the week prior. I had a banana and a glass of water for breakfast. I had heard that lemon juice helps accentuate things, so I cut up a fresh lemon and squeezed some in another cup of water. I didn't watch TV, or listen to the radio or any music that morning. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I had heard that pure cocoa helps accentuate the medicine, so I decided to take the medicine in cocoa. (I have since reconsidered the validity that cocoa accentuates psychedelics.) \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I used a coffee grinder and powdered the medicine, put it to a cup a cocoa, along with honey and drank it about 9:15 AM. By the way, I think the medicine tastes terrible, but this concoction helped make it less terrible.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 7. \r\n",
      "The therapy itself - the first 3 hours. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a fair amount anxiety that morning, sort of in the same realm as anxiety before you go to get a cavity filled at the dentist, if that makes sense. After ingestion I had a bit of difficultly sitting down and relaxing. I want going around the house cleaning things up, prepping things, my mind and body not wanting to relax and let things happen.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually I sat down on my comfy recliner and put the eye covers on. Things kicked in fairly quickly, with visuals and coldness in my extremities. Eventually I sat down on my comfy recliner and put the eye covers on. Things kicked in fairly quickly, with visuals and coldness in my extremities. I eventually had my guide put a blanket over me. The cat decided to make her home in my lap but I barely noticed. At one point my guide asked if I needed a booster dose, to which I said not at all. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "The first 2 to 3 hours (after I assume the first 30 minutes) were somewhat blurry to recall all the details.  In part this was possibly because I tried to keep my eyes closed and focus internally.  I was aware of music and colors, but did to focus on them, and tried to steer my mind towards contemplation. My goal was healing, and I thought focusing on fun patterns and colors would distract my mind from the task at hand. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I do remember imagining that I was on an operating table, half 'put under', as is done in a lot of operations these days. (That is when you are still semi-conscious, while they cut you open.) So I was imagining that even though I was not rationally thinking through all my therapeutic concerns, 'work' was being done. This is in line with modern research on psychedelics and neuroscience which is showing that psychedelics may facilitate neuro-plasticity and a rewiring of the brain. Meaning even while not thinking through my depression, the medicine was working to heal it by slowing down the overactive blood flow to the control centers of the brain. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I did have times of weeping and times of ecstasy. The ancient mantras - laughter is good medicine, and crying is good for the soul - are still around for a reason. I think it was beneficial to get my emotions supercharged, since normally I don't weep and I just as rarely have moments of pure explosive joy.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 8. \r\n",
      "The therapy itself - continued. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "A theme of gratefulness came across again and again.  It wasn't like I was directly coming face to face with my Higher Power, but that I was seeing all of his creation in a renewed and brighter way.  Sort of like a spotlight was on everything, to show the brilliance in the normal, to see the amazingness in the mundane. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I was grateful for my guide, for my wife, for the plants around me, for my house.  And this is despite all the faults and imperfections of each of these things.  I didn't see them as perfect, but as wonderful despite their brokenness. The lack of perfections would usually bother me, or keep me from really appreciating things. But in all these things I was content, at peace, in 'shalom'. I even noticed the floor was really dusty in places, but it was not bothersome to me.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "For I while I listened intently to the soundtrack to The Passion of the Christ. (Disclaimer, I like the movie but in no way endorse Mel Gibson or some of his less than perfect views.) I was able to appreciate the mystery of the historic Gospel narrative, its oriental nature, the ancientness, the exoticness, etc.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "It was interesting that when deep in therapy I periodically realized that my guide was in the room and I was almost embarrassed.  Perhaps because he was not 'with me' in therapy it felt a bit strange. And I am very glad I had him there, in case of emergencies. But perhaps if I ever do therapy again, I would have him in another room. \r\n",

      "I do remember my mind was in a way 'racing', like I had ADHD or something. Perhaps this was due to the medicine's ability to remove a sense of time from my consciousness, but it seemed like I would have a thought - deep realization, an intense focus on something or someone, or an idea, picture, feeling, or color - and it would give way fully to another totally different one, again and again.  And my brain was unable to keep focus on an object for too long.  It was like watching tv while your friend flips channels excessively. Not that this bothered me that much. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 9. \r\n",
      "The Therapy itself - continued; plus coming down and some insights I had. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent an extended time of looking at two photographs of myself and my wife, one from 11 years ago, and another from this year. This was extremely valuable.  It was like I was seeing myself like I was looking from the outside at me. Not an out of body experience, rather a perspective which was totally unique. I had a massive amount of compassion, empathy and love towards myself and my wife.  I could 'see' problems in our lives, ways in which we have been hurt in life, problems in our marriage, etc. I was able to see us both as little children, in need of love and patience and healing. If I ever do this kind of therapy again down the road I will be sure to have even more pictures of people handy. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I also looked for a while in the mirror.  What was interesting is that 15 years ago when I did psychedelics recreationally I never liked the mirror.  But now it was great.  I really enjoyed how I looked.  I even had an insight into who I was and the path I was on. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually I started coming down a little.  I was aware of a number of insights, which I wrote down (in no particular order): \r\n",
      "- that deep breathing is good for me. \r\n",
      "- that emotions are a gift to me.\r\n",
      "- that strong emotions are not bad for me (see the movie Garden State).\r\n",
      "- that my Higher Power is good. \r\n",
      "- that there is an immense amount of beauty in the world (I was intellectually aware of this before, but I was now more emotionally aware of it)\r\n",
      "- the importance of me making good lifestyle choices. \r\n",
      "- that there is no magic bullet for me in life. \r\n",
      "- that taboos and limits and moderation play an important role in a happy life for me. \r\n",
      "- that I need to work though hard things either in counseling or in journaling. \r\n",
      "- that focused, productive self reflection is essential to my healing\r\n",
      "- that I need to listen to the still small voice\r\n",
      "- that I need to be a better listener in general\r\n",
      "\n",
      "After the fact I realized my attitude towards a particularly important issue was changed, even though I have no recollection of thinking upon the issue during therapy. I had for a long time felt insecure about my life success, as judged by the world's standards.  I have a number of high school friends who have gone on to be very successful in their careers and business, and have compared them to myself, who earns a very modest living working with people with autism. Amazingly after therapy, this insecurity was no longer present. I now know that my life is not so bad, and I am not ashamed of not making much money compared to others or being as 'successful'.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 10.\r\n",
      "Post Therapy - the rest of the day. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I did a lot of journaling about thoughts, in the style of stream of consciousness writing. I tried my best to recount as much as I could remember because I didn't want to waste the experience by fading memories. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "The active part in the therapy was over after about 5 hours, by about 2:30 PM. I was surprised it was so quick, but possibly grinding the mushrooms before ingesting got them into as well as out of my system quicker than had I chewed them. I got very hungry and ate a medium sized meal, of an apple and some chips and salsa, while talking with my guide about the experience. We took a walk outside.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "As I came out of therapy, my back pain came back into my consciousness. In other words it was hurting a lot.  This is possibly partially due to the mushrooms and the experience itself, and partially due to being so sedentary for 5 hours. But the fresh air and walk did it some good. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I did have a headache, which was similar to a caffeine withdrawal headache, and after further reflection, I am pretty sure it was due not to dehydration, but the caffeine withdrawal. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "My guide made sure I was ok on my own and I gave him my blessing to leave. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I journaled some more.  I was and am committed to continue to journal daily about my thoughts, frustrations, and any continued insights. I have continued to journal daily. I am also committed to do Mindfulness (sitting still with eyes closed and focusing on the breath for 10 to 20 minutes per day, called MBSR). \r\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early evening I decide to go to the gym for a light cardio workout. In part this was to get my blood flowing to help my chronic back pain. I ate a lot that night and went to bed around 10 PM.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 11. (Final journal post in this series)\r\n",

      "\n",
      "(Note: This is still less than 2 weeks post therapy so according to the Fadiman book there may still be healing aftereffects to occur.) \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression - at least so far I do see a reduction in my depression. This is even considering that I am taking 1/3 the dosage of Lexapro I was taking prior to the therapy. I have more hope in general and less existential angst. I am willing to go back up on Lexapro if my mood takes a turn for the worse. I have heard a number of reports that these results may not last, either due to the afterglow wearing off, or our brains just resorting to their old wiring, etc. But so far so good. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Marital - my wife seems to think I am more patient with her and less judging. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Anxiety - in terms of anxious about events in life, maybe a bit lower. Yet I do feel my body still physically anxious. For example, when someone cuts me off driving I still get pissed off, yet am then able to reign myself in more quickly. I sometimes feel like I am sort of crawling out of my own skin a bit. But maybe this is just my body getting used to the lower dose of Lexapro, and my self feeling more emotions in general. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Sleep - the same. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Back pain - the same. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "My Spirituality - unchanged in my understanding and relationship to my Higher Power.  However, I do feel like I appreciate his world, his creation, and the beauty around me more. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally - the key I think is the phrase 'slightly better'. My outlook on life - slightly better.  My depression - slightly better.  My self image/esteem - slightly better. My view towards my wife - slightly better.  My hope for the future - slightly better. My appreciation of beauty and the little things in life - slightly better. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess the puzzle piece analogy comes to mind again.  This psychedelic therapy was slightly useful, helpful, beneficial (whatever word you want to use). Yet it is only one piece of the larger puzzle of self care and life treatment. For the therapeutic effects to have a chance at lasting I need to be sure to keep up with the other puzzle pieces. For the therapeutic effects to have a chance at lasting I need to be sure to keep up with the other puzzle pieces.  And for me those other puzzle pieces are daily Mindfulness sitting (MBSR), daily Journaling, regular exercising, continued devotion to my Higher Power and practice of my religious tradition, eating a fairly healthy diet, having healthy sleep patterns, listening better to my wife, knowing my limits, working through hard events and feelings in the journal, and increasing my self awareness - of feelings, emotions, reactions, thoughts. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no interest in taking another therapy session again anytime soon.  In fact, looking back it is sort of terrifying (in a non-terrifying sort of way). But I am thankful for the experience, thankful for my guide, thankful for the love and support of my wife, and thankful for all the preparation help I got reading things online and in books. Perhaps in 6 to 12 months I will undergo another therapy session. For now I wish others like me the very best in their quest for healing, and only advise them not to take this sort of therapy lightly and to do lots of homework.\r\n",

      "The following is a summary of my experience with dragons dynamite magic truffles I had yesterday, from the diary I have written during the trip and what I can remember from it. I was already familiar with psychedelics, having used acid something like seven times, mushrooms three times, and hawaiian baby woodrose once. I had never been able to experience psychedelics alone. I had heard it could be the best way to turn the trip into a deep introspective experience, and because I wanted to answer some questions like 'what is the goal of my life ?', 'what should I change to be happier ?', 'what should I do to be a better person ?', I decided that I had to do it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I had ordered a week before some magic truffles on the Internet. The specie is called 'Psilocybe pajateros' . I had ordered 6 grams of dried truffles. It was apparently equivalent to 15 grams of fresh stuff. Taking the whole thing would be a strong trip according the the seller. I decided to eat all the truffles at once, I have tried in different occasions to take half of a dose and then redose, but it has always been disappointing, lasting the comedown instead of increasing the edge of the experience.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So here are the set and the setting. I was some kind of tired after a week of stressing work. I was hesitating all day about taking the truffles this night. At 7pm, I took a decision. This would be the night. I prepared a music playlist on my computer: some Ravi Shankar, some Pink Floyd, some Air (french eletronic music band), Pat Metheny, Jimi Hendrix and Grateful Dead songs. I did some pranayama yoga exercies to relax before the journey, lighted some incense, and ate the truffles raw with some water to swallow more easily. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "After having eaten the half of the stuff, I felt mild nausea. It was really weird to feel it just a few seconds after chewing and swallowing, I had the feeling of poisoning myself badly. I forced myself to finish to eat the whole thing. Then I turned the TV on immediately, to watch the Simpsons, laugh and forget this nausea, and wait for the effects to come. At this time it was 8:45pm. I went quickly to brush my teeth in order to clean my mouth from the bad taste of the truffles. It helped to calm the nausea. But immediately I had some tremors and I was laughing at the Simpsons too easily. Fuck. I was watching the Simpsons to wait for the effects, but they were already starting to come.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "9:05 (T+20) : The Simpsons characters started to have weird and scary faces. The colors were too strong and the nausea was growing because of this. I shut down the TV on put the playlist on to calm down.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "9:09 (T+24) : Colors started to move mildly on one painting on the wall. I had never felt so quickly the effects on any psychedelic. I realised at this time it would be a mind blowing experience. I wasn't scared, but it would have been a lie to say I was 100% relax.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "9:11 (T+26) : My train of thought started to be disturbed. It was difficult to think about only one thing. I felt dizzy. I started to walk in the room, drawing circles, because I was sure it would help. It helped.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "9:13 (T+28) : I started to ask myself why I was doing this. Was it a good idea ? Was I really prepared for this ? It was stronger than anything I did before. No one of my friend knew what was going on. This thought was frightening. Should I call someone to tell ? And I started to laugh because I was considering the situation like if it wasn't myself, and it was funny. My mood was violently shifting every minute.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "9:20 (T+35) : Ravi Shankar was on. I started to feel the need to dance. I felt better. It was really enjoyable. I had the weird sensation of being one of these Indian women dancing to the sound of tablas and sitar. I am a man, but I felt like I was a woman. Weird but fun! Writing this on my diary, I realised that I was writing on it every 3 or 4 minutes. My god ! My time perception was already distorted.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "9:27 (T+42) : I have two plants in my house. I realised they were living beings, and the fact I own them must make me take care of them. My mood was still violently shifting from good to bad every minute, and I realised that mood was a critical factor to give an interpretation of reality, that there were infinite ways to consider anything depending on how I feel. Making sure that I would be in a good mood most of the time is really important to understand things properly.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "9:31 (T+46) : I felt tired. I sat on the couch. I knew it was because I was already tired before taking the truffles, so I decided it wasn't important.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "9:33 (T+48) : I started to squint. My right eye was moving to the left. I was able to feel it from the inside of my eyeball and obviously from what I was seeing. I had never heard of squinting on psychedelics. What that normal ? I had never heard of squinting on psychedelics. What that normal ? I decided once again to not give any importance to this. I knew the trip would be strong and that I was at the very beginning, so giving importance to such things wouldn't be useful comparing to what was waiting for me.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "9:34 (T+49) : Fuck ! My last note on the diary was only one minute earlier ? It seemed like at least 20 minutes ! Anyway, I wrote down that I realised something really important about myself. I was always worrying too much in my life. Instead of doing experiences (and I'm here not talking only about taking psychedelics, I'm talking about any experience you can do with your life) and then learn from them, I was always asking myself too many questions and it was preventing me from living. I decided at this time that I would care less about such questions and do more. At this time, it was really difficult to focus, and writing down was taking a lot of time, because I was always finding something better to write, about something completely different. I was telling myself all the time 'Man ! Write something, finish your sentence and see later about the rest'.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "(I'm here skipping some details to go to what's important).\r\n",
      "\n",
      "9:58 (T+1:13) : I realised something else. In my life I always worry about a lot of stuff, but most of the time I worry because I don't do like the rest of my friends. I don't like to go in bars to pick up girls, because I don't like this and for me this is not the way to start a relationship. I don't like to party every saturday because sometimes I just feel like relaxing and getting some rest. What ? I was worrying about this ? I do have the right to be myself and to have my own principles and way to live. We're all different. Do your stuff. I decided I would listen to myself more from now instead of listening to people.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "(Again I prefer to skip details).\r\n",
      "\n",
      "22:30 (T+1:45) : Everything's coming stronger. Feelings coming from the music. Hallucinations on every single part of the room. Lights. I was feeling incredibly good. I was not worrying any longer about myself, because this is not what was important at this time. I started to feel really connected to all other people, and disconnected from my ego. I started to feel really connected to all other people, and disconnected from my ego. I was used to this with shrooms and LSD, but here the feeling of love and compassion was growing and growing without limit. That was a fact, every human being must have love and respect for the others, period. Feeling of anger against others is evil. All I could feel was love, and love, and love. I was spelling aloud the word 'a-mour, 'a-mour', 'a-mour' (I'm French), like if it was helping me to understand the true nature of the word.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "From now I forgot to write down the time on my diary. All the following happened between 22:30 and 1:30. (So the total trip duration from the beginning would be almost 5h).\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly realised that every person must take care about the words they use. No one should offend anyone. Words can make people enemies. Enemies are only people that cannot understand each other.  I realised that this leads to WAR. I started to cry. The love feeling was overwhelming, so at this time I was unable to understand why people were killing each other. For money ? For food ? For petrol ? If they knew which words to use, people who need something can get it from people who have more. And people who have a lot and want to steal from the ones who have less are devils. I also realised that everyone should learn from other cultures, otherwise we won't be able to understand people who live differently, and then it could be the root of misunderstandings, and it might lead to war.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "People say 'War ? Yeah, this is terrible. But this is not my problem, I have already a lot of problems to deal with'. 'My' problem ? 'MY' ? What was this ? 'My' ? We are all brothers and sisters on Earth, because we all have the same parents, who were living thousands of years ago. We are all from the same family. I realised that problems like war are only family problems, raised to a breathtakingly scale. I started to understand clearly all those people dedicating their life to fight against war. Fight against war ? It was no-sense. You cannot fight to calm down people. This is the root of the problem. Every problem must be taken with non-violence. At this time I had a profound respect to Gandhi, who did a lot of great things without 'fighting'.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "At this time I realised I was still overwhelmed by love, but at the same time I was scandalised and angry. Angry. Oh lord, it was disgusting to feel some anger. I understood that I had to practice yoga every day to prevent myself from getting feelings like anger. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, I realised that not only we are all from the same family, but we are from the same family than plants, grass, rocks, and all the rest. We are all made from the same chemicals stuff, neutrons, protons... Evolution of species and reproduction from a same species is only transfers of molecules... We are all the same thing ! The 7 billion people we are, are the same person. We are all GOD. GOD is inside of all of us. And GOD is pure love. I don't know how the idea of God came to me, but it did, it was pure evidence.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I realised I have to dedicate all the free time in my life to pray. I have to connect to God as often as possible. Prayers, yoga... the goal is always the same. Connect to God. Spread love all around the world. Because god is love, and we cannot survive without love. Children of God are fighting each other and don't realise that parts of God are dying here and there. I don't know if I believed in God before this moment, but from now I was without any hesitation.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I realised randomly a lot of other things. Psychedelic songs are prayers. They relate the story of God in various ways. I realised also that I might move in an ashram to dedicate my life to God. Those people living there have understood before what I just realised now. They spread love all around the world. I realised also that religions that use any kind of violence will fall, because they're FIGHTING for God and you can't fight for God. You just have to love. Praying is loving.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "...\r\n",
      "The comedown was quite okay. I felt starving. I had a beer, a meal and a cigarette. Bak to normal life. I'm not going to move tomorrow to any ashram. This implies too much, I don't have the energy to consider  this seriously. But for sure I'm going to increase my practise of yoga and take care more and more about the words I use and try to love people as much as possible. This is the only way for me to have a good life.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, taking psychedelics alone was a great way to solve some of my problems, but because it was a high dose (for me at least), it made me able to realise that I truly believe in God and that I should take care as much as possible about others more than myself. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking notes was essential to understand the train of thoughts during the trip the day after.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As I said, I was really surprised by the strength of the effects, mental and physical. If it would have been my first experience, it could have been a really bad experience.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your future psychedelics experiences, and take care.\r\n",

      "Background: Experienced with many different psychedelics (especially tryptamines); a natural inclination towards anything psychological, spiritual or otherworldly.\r\n",

      "The Experience:\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I started off by drinking some mushroom tea. I had infused exactly 1 gram of what I knew to be very potent mushrooms into the water, previously boiled. I really enjoyed drinking the mushroom tea; it's always so calming and meditative for me to just sit/lay down drinking the tea and clearing my mind before the journey. It feels sacred and reminiscent of something my ancestors did - very grounding for me.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I drank the tea slowly and when I finished it, I felt a little something already as it had been about 20 minutes. I then prepared a bowl of caapi leaves on top of weed for smoking. I went to the window and smoked these together. I smoked three bowls in succession because I knew that I needed a substantial amount of these caapi leaves  (not extract; just plain leaves) to get a decent effect and to achieve potentiation of the trip. I definitely got the potentiation I was looking for! It was a relatively quick but still somewhat gradual ascent, and the difference was very noticeable. I felt like the come-up all happened at once after the effects of the caapi hit me. I felt dreamier and more blissful, as caapi seems to help bring about this peaceful effect. My open eye visuals became particularly interesting, and I began to get a similar visual effect to many of the other times I've done mushrooms and/or DMT. This effect can be best described as something that happens when I look ahead of myself anywhere from 5 to 20 feet away. What happens is, wherever I'm looking, the empty space that my eyes are focused on develops into various shapes. It's as if the empty space appears as a type of clear plasma and then starts to get defined edges and proceeds to form into these shapes",
      " then, the shapes break apart and the small pieces come towards me on either side.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "As the pieces come towards me, sometimes they move in strange rigid (often symmetrical) patterns and other times they messily tumble on over. But every time this happens, the pieces are on each side, right and left, of where I was originally looking.. and they tumble over to me on either side above my head and then come down to the ground on either side of me. When they come down upon me, I can feel their energy sweep over me. Sometimes it almost feels like a light breeze. This happened countless times throughout the trip. In fact, from smoking the caapi on, I don't think this effect went away for the entire experience. Things felt very 'hyperspacey' and alien yet familiar in a similar way to the DMT space. I kept losing myself in strange trains of thought that just spiraled deeper and deeper until words could not describe under any circumstances what these concepts were. Whenever I came out of the trance a bit and attempted to extract whatever it was I had just been thinking about, the thoughts would dissipate, almost as if they weren't compatible with the conscious part of my mind.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, sometimes the thoughts would even seem to disguise themselves as other thoughts that made more sense, but I would feel that these 'replacement thoughts' didn't come close to the complexity or meaning of the original ones. I came to call the original thoughts 'inaccessible thoughts', because usually I can't access them from my conscious mind. (These thoughts come to my mind often when using caapi, and since this experience, when using caapi other times I have been able to 'extract' a few of them by trying exceptionally hard to hold on to them and then write them down as best as I can. In this case, the thoughts have ended up translating to what seem to be premonitions of the future; various situations that seem plausible but have never actually happened - at least not yet!)\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I kept on smoking the caapi and went into my room to trance out. I found that this level of blissfulness was hard to contain",
      " I eagerly let go of myself and went back and forth between realities. I kept lapsing out of existence and returning 'home'. So refreshing and just",
      " so right. There was no mistaking that this feeling was quite erotic as well, though not by a physical sense in the slightest. On the astral plane, various entities came to me and would give me advice and food for thought. Many of these issues are personal, but they had to do with various life choices, things that could or might happen in my life, and people in my life that I have met or would meet and change the course of my life forever. Although this astral plane was not by any means only inhabited by light forces (as opposed to dark ones), I will say that it felt perfectly crafted. It was exactly what it needed to be and I accepted it completely and lovingly. Because I wasn't really attached to my ego, a lot of this banter between me and entities took place through abstract communications that seemed to be of a different nature or language. However, I could still decode and understand it because it coincided with the kinds of communications that my ego self can normally understand. These communications just had to be transmitted in alternate ways since my ego self was barely present. I can't put into words what these abstract communications were, because they were just that - too abstract! \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon enough, I decided to put about 20mg of DMT in the pipe between the caapi leaves. This turned out to be a great idea! I felt no hesitation this time (as nearly every time before doing DMT, I become nervous even though I love it). The caapi actually made me kind of 'crave' the DMT it seemed. I have heard of this happening to others as well with caapi",
      " The DMT just being, well, YUMMY, for lack of a better adjective",
      " After having the DMT, I felt super trancey and wanted to close my eyes",
      " but oddly enough, I felt that some sort of entity was telling me to keep them open. I don't know why this is. When I closed my eyes, I saw nothing",
      " but when I kept my eyes open, the entire room was transformed and there were beings inside every piece of furniture; every 'empty' space; every wall",
      " I could feel the personalities of each being. It was out of this world and amazing.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes the bliss would overcome me and I would start to close my eyes but then a conceptual voice or entity would alert me and tell me to keep my eyes open and pay attention to what was happening in the room. My intention of this experience had been to take in my surroundings and appreciate them, because I would be moving soon and I wanted to reflect on the times I had spent at this location",
      " so maybe this was just a way for me to fulfill my original intention. Because this is a new house, nobody has lived in it before its current inhabitants (including me).. otherwise perhaps I would have felt the energies of previous inhabitants and relived foreign memories. I felt as if I were reliving various things that had happened in the room so far to me and others that had lived here, all of which felt vaguely familiar (because they'd taken place in my life)",
      " but since I was an egoless being, I didn't connect them to my personal life. I felt that I was able to see them in a completely different light, free of attachments and judgements. It was undoubtedly therapeutic.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I walked into the backyard after this and revisited the plant spirits outside. I'd had an experience a couple of weeks before where I'd taken 1.5 grams of the same mushrooms and had felt all of the plants' personalities. There was one tree that looked like a popsicle and it was pretty huge. I felt like this tree was almost condescending and didn't really like humans that much. There was another plant with jagged leaves that seemed very feminine and stylish. I picked up on an ambivalent attitude from this plant. Another tree was one in which I had climbed in the past to save my partner's cat, and he greeted me with recognition and approval.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "All throughout this time, I kept smoking bowls with caapi and weed mixed together. Those 'empty space' visuals never went away. It seemed like this time, they were often chess-themed. There were some bowling pins included in there too, for whatever reason",
      " There were mainly pawns and queens and horses and other chess pieces folding and breaking into pieces and coming towards me everywhere I turned. I found this to be fascinating, and if I moved my eyes in certain ways, I could control the ways in which they broke into pieces and the patterns they made on the way over to me. I liked the way it felt when they came down above my head and landed on either side of me; it felt like they were saying hello and giving me presents. The perfectly blissful feeling of exploring the hyperspace version of the territory I was usually so familiar with and appreciating everything about existence persisted for me, and I couldn't have possibly been happier to be right where I was in the moment. :)\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I went inside and loaded up another bowl of weed + caapi + DMT, and then went back outside to the side of the house and sat on a concrete block in the yard. It had been more than half an hour since the last time I had DMT, as I like to wait at least 30 minutes between DMT voyages when I'm already tripping on something else (or at all, for that matter, but I tend to only use DMT on top of other psychedelics nowadays). Because I'd already smoked a couple bowls of caapi prior to this, I got started on the bowl with the DMT right away. Like the last time, it came on very strongly with a relatively small amount",
      " but this time, I experienced an entirely different emotional effect. Suddenly, an intense fear was struck into me. It was like one second I felt totally relaxed and blissful, and the next second I was dealing with a deep-rooted fear whose origin was unknown to me. The first thing I noticed was the ground and how I could see everything decaying and turning into other things.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "It was as if I was concentrating on how different animals and organic materials had absorbed into the dirt and grass and decayed, and then the particles that made those up recycled themselves into other things. I felt as if I was watching this cycle of death and rebirth and became hyperaware of all of the things that had died and decomposed and then been recycled into new materials and new life in this very yard. However, the random fear seemed very urgent. It seemed like somebody was trying to tell me something important. I noticed that a certain triangular part of the grass a little bit in front of me to the left was much brighter than the rest of the yard (it wasn't actually, but that's what I saw). I understood that this triangular section of the yard was apparently a 'danger zone', and I felt that some entity was warning me that there were negative spirits there and I had to be extra careful and aware to not allow the negativity in to my own psyche. At the time, I wasn't sure what to make of this and still am not sure to this day.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't necessarily believe in spirits or DMT entities as being apart from my consciousness (I don't have any beliefs when it comes to this sort of thing - I keep an open mind to all possibilities), but at the time, the fear made it seem so real to me that I tried to listen to the entity that had just communicated to me to be careful, and I stayed aware and alert so as to not let in this negative energy that was threatening me in the 'danger zone'. This fear gradually dissipated and I once again felt blessed and left with the same blissful and transcendent tryptamine feeling I'd had throughout the entire experience up until that random fearful moment. During the moments where I felt fearful, it didn't actually bother me very much. I took the fear for what it was and didn't make it into anything else; fear is just an emotion. I knew somewhere within myself that I didn't *actually* have anything to fear. I just wondered, and still do, what this meant or whether I might be able to think of any metaphorical interpretations to what I experienced in the yard.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "After I came down from the DMT, I was still seeing plenty of OEVs and still seeing the objects forming out of empty space and tumbling towards me. I thanked the Universe and the plant spirits for these presents! :) I decided to take a walk to the park down the street. The leaves were just beginning to change, as my favorite season, Autumn, was starting! The leaves delighted me and walking felt interesting. It was like I was hovering a few inches off the ground. When I got to the park, I passed some people and could feel all of their energies very intensely. I got the sense that most of these people didn't really look too deeply into life, which felt like a shame to me",
      " but I supposed that everyone was just who they were meant to be all the same. It was incredibly interesting being at the park people-watching, and I felt like I could hear things and make out words being said from far away (this happens to me a lot on caapi where I experience these heightened sensory abilities).\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt like a fly on the wall in the distance; a spy, almost. That's how clear things were that people were saying from far away. I had begun to get very tired by this point, as it was almost 6 hours after I'd drank the tea. I sat down on a log in the park somewhere and put my head down and just tranced out in a half trippy, half sleepy state of mind. I stayed here for another 20 minutes or so, then began to walk back home. As soon as I got home, feeling refreshed from the nice afterglow, I jumped into bed and fell into a deeper-than-usual sleep rather quickly.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Because caapi is a RIMA MAOI and doesn't last very long, and on top of that, my route of administration was smoking, I experienced no negative side effects such as nausea or stomach discomfort and did not have to watch my diet. I felt that the caapi made the mushroom trip MUCH more visual than I'd ever experienced mushrooms to be before, and I felt much more spiritually ecstatic than usual throughout the entire experience. I also felt much more dreamlike. Smoked caapi seems to work wonders with mushrooms and DMT; Terence McKenna was definitely onto something when he suggested smoking caapi leaves on top of mushrooms. I'm going to have to explore this combination furthermore!\n",

      "Hello, my name is Donovan and this will be my first report regarding experiences of a psychedelic nature. Just to provide a little background regarding myself and the circumstances surrounding my encounter I will tell you that I am what some would call a very spiritual personality. My brother, Boob we call him, and I have been on a rollercoaster ride of fantastical advancements since we read The Celestine Prophecy in 1999. He, Boob I mean, leans a little more toward the theoretical side of our sojourn while I like to dive right into the more practical areas, which of course includes the use of psychedelic substances for the exploration of the psychological aspects of our perception. I had always been primarily interested in altered states of consciousness due to their ability to so brazenly expose one to their deepest illusions and most precarious understandings, and I had experimented with LSD and psilocybin as well as many of the more conventional substances such as marijuana and alcohol for quite some time to little avail. I found that THC helped to enhance my attention span and enthusiasm towards hobbies such as writing and playing video games, while the relaxing effects of alcohol allowed for me to be much more outgoing in social environments and to stop hiding my true nature from others. Hallucinogens provided a much needed and awe-inspiring vacation from the monotony of everyday life but had never left me with any truly groundbreaking insights into the nature of reality aside from revealing how dynamic and liquid my perception of it could actually become. I had thought that my aforementioned forays into the lesser known world would have prepared me for some of the more powerful experiences available to the human psyche but upon testing salvia for the first time I was made briskly aware of how deeply wrong I was. What happened in that instance would change my life forever, but that is a story for another time. In this submission I would like to make an attempt at illustrating as best I can the sheer craziness that is the DMT trip.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "After trying salvia a few times before reaching what I like to think of as the bottom of the universal mystery I became very frightened of that encounter with what seemed to be the real world, if such a place exists. However, I was still very enticed by the idea of returning, only under more manageable circumstances. With salvia I could  not even ascertain a method of fighting to remain myself let alone negotiate the great void to which I been introduced, and I was hoping to find an easier way to get out there. Meditation works to some extent, but could never take me so far so fast or in such a tangible and observable manner. At the same time no other narcotics could compare to the all-consuming effects of that simple little plant. I was in a fix to be sure. After spending the past couple of years dealing with severe family-related financial problems, having little to no time or aspiration for uncovering deeper levels of understanding I felt stunted and stifled in my quest for personal evolution. When we stumbled upon accounts of DMT and Ayahuasca induced adventures relating encounters with entities existing in a realm that seems realer than this one I felt that we had encountered providence, as we just so happened to know someone who actually had some DMT for sale at the time. As soon as Boob and I got back from work with our pay in pocket I purchased myself a one way ticket to elsewhere thinking that if I could handle salvia at full force then surely I would be capable of piloting the DMT vehicle without difficulty. Yet again, I would find myself deeply humbled.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to relate my experience for what it truly was I must first elucidate my state of mind in regard to the occasion. Throughout the course of my spiritual and psychological training I have become deeply obsessed with the concept of an existing God figure in the universe. Now before you jump to any conclusions let me state that my fascination has absolutely nothing to do with any religious study or kinship, in fact, though I believe that some ideas related in the Bible and other such religious texts are especially relevant to my personal understanding, I do not, never have, and never will prescribe to any one religion and maintain my personal opinion that devotion to any religion destroys ones ability to comprehend a true God to some extent if not completely. The God figure that I speak of is simply the infinite mystery of existence. Where did we come from? Where are we going? What is our absolute situation, our ultimate truth? What is really happening here? The God that I seek is simply an ultimate comprehension of who I really am beneath the manufactured illusions of an inescapably superficial reality. The self-proclaimed realizations that I had made during my encounters with salvia were particularly frightening to me and of course these would inevitably colour my experience with DMT. I intended only to maneuver deeper into this bizarre void of consciousness in the hope that some greater sanctity might be revealed thereat, and though I cannot be certain of the validity of my conclusions regarding the event, I do believe that just such an occurrence has transpired.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, when I went to pick up the brown sugar-like pebbles from my buddy down the street he offered me some magic mushrooms that he had left over from a little while back along with it and I figured that one couldnt go wrong with a price as cheap as free, another friend of mine had left my brother and I a couple bottles of wine that he had procured from the warehouse in which he works as a celebratory gift for me having recently acquired employment involving restorative carpentry with Boob in an impossible economic environment, and we already had some extremely beautiful weed to smoke, so I was sure that this would be a weekend to remember. I have a severely addictive personality and tend to overdo things as often as is possible. I rarely ever really regret this behavior, but boy was I in for it this time. I decided that since we had just finished a long and arduous week of woodworking and we were already tuckered out for the night that I would save the mushrooms and wine for the next day when we were well-rested and did not have to work in the morning, but I just could not will myself to wait on the DMT. I had already been waiting long enough.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "For the price of just ten dollars I obtained a plastic vial containing seven rocks resembling amber but smelling very similar to old dust in the attic of my childhood home, each of which would be sufficient to propel an individual into the cosmos. Of course, having no grasp for the gravity of the drug that I was about to abuse I asked Boob for a small nugget to pack as a filter and then proceeded to cover it with three stones smashed into powder. Here we go! I say confidently to my dear brother as I set the flame the pipe and pulled. I had intended to hold the hit in as long as possible for maximum effect but almost immediately found myself scrambling to get the smoke out before it all became too intense to endure.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the smoke entered my lungs I witnessed the objects around me tear apart from their halos, leaving neon streaks of electromagnetism hanging in the air around them which stuck in place and then shrank as though being pulled by expansion into the vastness of space. At this point I remembered it, not from any experiential account that I can recall per se, but more from a primal, instinctive perspective. I knew what was happening, and all I that could say before collapsing on the floor was, Ohhhhh... The sound of my voice droned out into the rapidly shuffling distance as a wave of electrical vapor swelled into a tsunami that came flooding in from the right of me, and all that I could do to keep from being swallowed was drop onto my back and close my eyes in an attempt to escape the chaos that was suddenly ensuing all around me. I witnessed then, without eyes to see, the ceiling and walls of the room transform and inflate with a weightless force into an enormous dome of prisms resembling diamond eyeballs peering in at me from the edge of the world while radiating rainbow coronas in every direction. It was as though the living room had become this great museum of spectacles that had always been there just beyond my ability to perceive and had now been revealed, ephemerally, for me to partake of. I felt that though I could observe the museum from a singular point within the museum that somehow I, at the same time, am the museum. I wanted ever so desperately to exacerbate how amazing it was in vivid detail but all that I could manage was, I cant fraking explain it... I dont even know what to do with myself here... That was when the shifting began.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly everything was tumbling and folding into itself, much like what I have experienced with salvia in the past, however, the difference is that this time I was still me and was able to see what was actually happening. The gravity was shifting, but not without deliberation. The very rules that make up the game of life were being rapidly changed ever so slightly by some alien persona very concisely, as though the function of the existential machine depended upon the shuffling of these values. When I use the term alien I do not mean extraterrestrial, I mean truly alien, inconceivable. Something entirely unknowable. Again, this conception is totally congruent with my experience of salvia, however, again, this time I can actually maneuver, and so I move toward the edge of the dome where I find a strange man standing in the corner manipulating pulleys and levers as though he was running the stage arrangement for some grand play. He works the mechanisms in the corner while turning his gaze around to me, smiling wildly. He looks eerily similar to Two-Face from Batman, and even appears two-dimensional, like a comic-book character. I think of him as being the museums curator. I can remember thinking, This guys obnoxious. before making my way back to the museum showroom in the center of the dome. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon reaching said area I found myself standing in the living room again, effervescent clouds of color streaming from the walls into the vastness surrounding like a cacophony of vacuums oscillating infinitely. I could then just begin to hear disjointed ramblings approaching. It was a myriad of sounds collecting into small bunches that made up little symphonies. Each one was a different genre of music entirely and sounded quite discordant uniquely, but altogether the differing music created a larger orchestra and I could just barely make out the melody. The song was beautiful beyond words, yet still, I could not stand the madness. The rules were continuing to shift, the gravity continuing to fold, and I feared, yet again, that I would be lost forever. Looking over towards the couch I see Boob sitting straight up with his eyes fixed on me, and for the first time since the initial puff I can feel my own eyes and how wide they are. I must have appeared positively frightening at the time. When I see him I get the feeling that I am viewing a mirror of some kind and I am relieved that he is present. My exact thoughts were, Im cool, thats Boob right there. Thats Boob? Im Boob! Im Boob? Im not Boob. Have I been Boob this whole time? and all of a sudden I am someone else. I have been the entire time. Then who is Donovan? I wondered. The riddle was humongous and encompassing. Everyone that I knew was in the room at this point, all going about separate businesses, I just couldnt see them if I tried to look. I could feel them though, because I was them! Residual memory. I told myself, but I was my brother, so who was me? The rules continued to fluctuate, not immensely, but just enough to keep us all confused. The curator continues to meddle obnoxiously, but not without reason. I reach to my left and feel the leg of the coffee table.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly I am back in the living room again. Boob notices the change in my demeanor and asks me if Ive returned. I think so is all that I can honestly tell him. There is still a very conceivable current of electricity snaking its way throughout the room, but for all intents and purposes I am me again, and I am lucid. I tell Boob that I think I have to vomit and begin walking into the bathroom. Immediately upon entering I recognize a strong feeling of nostalgia sweeping over me like excessive déjà vu. I said to myself, Ive been here before and for whatever reason it seemed so very sad and desperate, as if Id been there forever. The area repeatedly assembled itself in patterns befitting its character and I felt as though I was standing backstage at the show of all things, alone. After attempting to gag myself into vomiting a few times in hopes of relieving myself somewhat I looked into the mirror and saw that I was me, truly, not some other person, and suddenly I sobered. I walk into the living room and smoke a cigarette while trying to accurately relate my experience to Boob. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning we ate the mushrooms with the intention of playing a two-player role-playing game while tripping. No more than a half an hour in and I was no longer cognitive. I had absolutely no idea what we were doing or what in the hell the point of any of it was, so I stopped playing and we began to watch a television show. Immediately I recognized the embossed quality of the picture from the last time I had ingested psilocybin whereat myself and a good friend of mine sat here all night laughing hysterically at a British television show about survivors of an Earthly holocaust rebuilding humanity on a barren planet, and I suspected that I would experience the same type of trip as then, mild and unproductive. I was wrong. Within an hour or so the entire room had taken on this very distant quality, like the walls of an aquarium, right there, yet so far a way, and the objects in my environment were floating on a tide as though the ocean has swept into the room and overtaken things. The cat was being a grouch in the corner and I was finding this all very amusing and enthusing until...\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I find myself awakening to the realization that Boob and I had been sitting here doing all of this together for ages, forever even. It was like we were the first two people in the Garden of Eden waiting throughout eternity for each other to wake up from this crazy dream that weve been having. I felt as though he knew every intimate detail of my life, and in this nakedness I felt ashamed and scared. I felt as though I needed to retreat. I couldnt bring myself to embrace the extreme unity of this relationship. I could not face this reconciliation, yet. I had to run away and hide in waiting. I felt so stupid that I had been doing this for so long. The whole world knew as well. Everyone that had ever been was pointing and laughing at me because I created this insane illusion to hide myself from my closest friend. A voice is telling me to get up. At first it seems like a motivator telling me to get up and make a better life for myself, create a better me, but then it begins to twist and turn, seeming more like a first-responder finding my body on the ground and begging me to be alright. I begin to think that maybe I really have been in some horrible accident and this is someone trying to revive me. Get up! You have to get up! I open my eyes to find that it is indeed a person speaking to an unconscious body, on the television. Damn, that was freaky. I tell Boob who is hiding under a blanket on the couch. We both come to and decide to take another shot at playing the video game.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "We run our characters in circles and stare at the clouds laughing and exclaiming how very awesome everything looks for about fifteen minutes before throwing our controllers to the floor and laughing at them as well. I feel as if I am at the peak of something now, just close enough to reach higher, and so I suggest taking another hit of the DMT. Of course my brother isnt into it (I think hes afraid), but I dont let that deter me and I take a hit of what remains in the pipe from yesterday. It greatly enhances the trip but does little else, nothing worth mentioning here at least. Later on that night I take another hit with a very good friend of mine who cannot partake of other drugs due to enforced legal parameters, and we got high together, that was about the gist of it. It was a very fun night, but nothing exceptional beyond what Ive already mentioned.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, disappointed with not having returned to the fantastic museum the night before I waited until early in the morning the next day to try one last time, as our resources had grown slim and my brother hadnt taken his chance yet. I could remember distinctly having felt as though I were fighting the trip the first time and that I needed to relax in order to experience it fully. It just so happened that the wine had been left over from the first night and all seemed to be perfectly aligned. I drank the wine slowly as I watched videos on the internet of people relating their own experiences with the drug in order to build myself up to the moment. It was an extremely beautiful young lady that described, to the best of her abilities, having seen angels in her visions that finally pushed me over the edge, and I packed up probably a little more than I should have. I took a long, slow drag of the pipe and immediately I recognized having made the same mistake again.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I cannot fully remember what happened here as of yet, but I can tell you that I was scared beyond my wits upon awakening from it. I recall having become a two-dimensional black and white zigzag pattern and remaining that way for quite some time. I felt as though others were watching from somewhere, though from where I could not tell, as I was existing in a two-dimensional universe. I remember a gigantic face, somewhere. A womans face, made of rainbow colors. She was watching me, and it seemed as though she had always been watching me but I simply had not noticed until now. Though she seemed complacent, I felt as though she was happy that I had recognized her. During the episode I lost consciousness at some point and had very vivid dreams wherein my brother failed to relate to me his experiences with DMT several times over the course of a full weeks worth of time, even though he had not even really tried it yet, after which I awakened to my brother getting up very early in the morning which led me to believe that I had skipped a day and that we had to go to work immediately, which scared me quite a bit. All in all, it was a seemingly eventless experience, but I feel that the insights are apparent, and I am extremely grateful to have been a part of it. Until next time...\n",

      "This is something I have desired and feared for a long time -- to throw myself into my biological ocean and not just float, but also swim. I have used mushrooms (and I mean use in the sense that a painter uses his brush and pallet to express himself) multiple times before, but never completely by myself. It has never happened like this before. For that reason, I write.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot explain my motivations for this experience exactly. Lately, though, I have been reading more and more about Zen Buddhism and the release of what Alan Watts calls the ego. The immediate set and setting was as such: my life at the time was really creating a lot of stress, although it seemed to be on the upturn. Still though, a lot of conflicting inner dialogue.  I had returned to my hometown for a court date, had no money, brought nothing with me, and as result was utterly bored. I think the most direct motivation, however, was my introduction to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, more specifically the manual created by Timothy Leary. I knew that I could not afford much, but figured it was the best way I could think of to spend my money at the time.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The day before my trip, I planned. I decided that the most comforting place to go would be my mothers bed. It has been her bed all of my life, and has always been a place where I feel safe. I also decided to do it early in the morning, so I could be by myself while I peaked since my brother would be at school and my mom at work. I went and obtained the mushrooms. They seemed very healthy. That night, I was a child again and it was Christmas Eve.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "My mom woke me up at 8 a.m. like I asked her to, but I did not tell her why. Based on her reaction to me telling her about my experience after it happened, this was a wise choice. I had some errands to get out of the way, and I wanted to read some more of the Book of the Dead. I also chose to eat half of the mushrooms that I got (1.5 grams) and make tea, which is my favorite method of ingestion, with the other half. I chopped up half of the caps and stems and added them to the tea bag along with the shake. I think I used some sort of raspberry tea. I then walked up to mothers room, turned the television off, and cleared the bed. I supported myself with pillows so that I could eat the mushrooms and drink the tea without any inconvenience. Another thing that I think is noteworthy is that my dog, Lola, was with me the whole time.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought about the things I had read in the Book of the Dead, and tried to make myself aware of landmarks to let me know that it had begun. I do not want to trivialize the information in this book because I do not think this is the place nor do I feel I can do it justice in my own words. My advice is to read it for yourself and, also, to use it because it is a very powerful tool. Significant events did occur, however, that correlated with this book so I think they are important details in my story.  The first was the drone. I heard a low hum begin that reverberated like a gong. This continued throughout the entire what I will call my ascension period.  The next event was a burning at the base of my spine. Throughout my ascension period this burning sensation flowed up my spine into my skull. I made a point of allowing these events to happen, not to restrict them in any way. I believe this is a crucial point of focus if one wants to enjoy his or her psychedelic experience fully. Resistance and rationalization seem to only lead to fear and loathing.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I started to doubt this feeling, so I closed my eyes to see what would happen. In my previous experiences with psychedelics, this has always made things more interesting, but I always found it incredibly hard to keep my eyes closed. This time however, I would not allow my ego to fight back. I closed my eyes again and soon found myself in a fetal position in the middle of the bed with Lola lying right beside me. At this point I noticed her and began to rub her belly. I will admit, as well, that for a fleeting moment I felt a sexual connection to her, but it was soon recategorized in my brain as a love of deep friendship.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The Book of the Dead makes a point of recognizing sexual desires, as well as all others, as products of the mind. Under the guidance of the mushrooms the boundaries between these desires seem to be temporarily washed away. But if you allow your ego to run free in your mind like the wild, logical animal that it is, it will inform you of the state of the things with much more honesty than it does in its usual cage. I digress.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "With my eyes closed, I began to move them around behind my lids to get them used to the feeling. My visuals remind me of what happens when you put a magnet up to a television screen. The background was black with waves of color spectrums pulsating, flowing, ever-changing yet constant. I was ecstatic. I was delighted. I was safe. Then, I peaked.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally, it is impossible for me, as well as most that I know, to sleep while influenced by psychedelic substances. Its simply something that cannot be forced. This time however, I lost myself. I went into what I would call a trance. For it was as if I was dreaming, but my entire self was there. It must be what people experience during lucid dreaming. I do not remember much of it, but I will tell you what I can. The first thing that I saw was a very bright light coming from everywhere. I also remember some blues in the background after the light subsided a little, but the light was always present. I do not have any sequence of time for these events but there are images that are quite vivid in my head.  Soon I was somewhat introduced to two characters. There were definitely more of them but these are the two that I can remember.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "The first was the largest being I have ever seen. He took up my whole field of vision. He appeared to be some sort of genie as he was bound at the wrists by gold gauntlets and possible elsewhere on his body. He was dark skinned and fairly old.  Despite his apparent bondage, he seemed very content. One idea I reflected on later was that he is the physical polar opposite of my pale, skinny, and young appearance.  The other being I almost immediately associated with my mother. It was a sort of black bird, as it was flying at a very fast rate in and out of my field of vision. The first reason I associated it with my mother was that it had a sort of fiery mane down its upper back and my mom has red hair.  If I talked to them, I do not remember what we talked about. All I know is that they were both very content creatures and very comforting to me.  I do vividly remember them waving goodbye to me as I opened my eyes and returned to the external world.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "If I am calling the first part my ascension period then this was my descent back into reality. I realized I had only drunken one cup of the mushroom tea and that I had intended to drink three. I do not think I needed any more than I took. What is ironic is that this was my deepest experience and yet the smallest dose I have ever taken.  It was now 1:00 p.m. I hoped that the psilocybin had not become inactive and quickly put the cup in the freezer to save for someone else. I then got the urge to call up a couple of my friends because I really wanted to talk and to smoke some weed. My friends were intrigued by my mental state so without any hesitation said they would pick me up soon. I felt like smoking a cigarette for the first time all day so I decided to take Lola out and do just that. We went outside and I lit up.  \r\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the street and an alley, there is a group of dogs who constantly bark. Usually I would not let Lola go over there because I was sure that she just wanted to bark back at them.  This time, I felt an urge to allow her to lead me. So around the block we went, me trying to smoke a cigarette and her desperately pulling on her leash. We soon got to the pack of dogs that were in a chain link fence. There were two young pit bulls and a smaller white mutt. Everybody was barking like crazy, and I stood there and watched. Then, something happened. \r\n",
      "\n",
      "The bigger of the two pit bulls started attacking the mutt. It had its neck in its mouth and was pulling back and forth. I stood in awe, I couldnt move. A lady came outside and started yelling at the dogs to stop. She was terrified; I still was completely silent and still. She started screaming, Help me! Help me! over and over again. Upon hearing that, my statuesque state was shattered. I leapt into action. First, I tied up Lola, who was still barking, so that she didnt try to intervene. I then jumped over the fence and went straight for the two dogs without a second thought. At this point, the lady was hysterical, probably fearing for her dogs life.  She began to beat on the pit bull, pulling on the two of them, trying to get him to stop. I put my hands on the back of the pit bull and began talking calmly to him, stroking him gently.  I kept telling the woman that she could not force this and that the pit bull had to let go on his own. I think she finally heard me, because she backed off a bit and as she did I guided the pit back towards me with my arms. He let go. She quickly scooped up the wounded dog and took him inside, with the pit bull at her heels.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "After safely inside, she repeated over and over again, Thank you, thank you so much. All I could find myself asking was why? I truly believe that dog was going to kill the other if there was no intervention. What would make him do such a thing? Who has made him into such a creature? This woman? Another? Was the dog simply disturbed? These questions raced through my head as I walked out the door towards my house.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this event may seem trivial to some, but to me it was the external sister event to my mostly internal ascension period. I had somehow brought some knowledge of myself as well as the world out of me and used it in the external world. I say this because I am highly suspect of whether or not I would have been able to have done what I did without the first part of the journey.
