The body high at this point has become euphoric, unlike anything I've ever experienced on marijuana. Wondering where my friend A is, and discontent with the current group of people, I set off to find him and take my trip down a more serious path. He has been wandering around the park, and somehow I locate him. Our ensuing trip around the park was the clear highlight of the trip and the part I enjoyed and learned most from.
