Motor functions were also diminished I felt like walking like a zombie, just half stumblingÂ…I get into the bathroom and look at myself and watch my face and how large my pupils are and watch my face turn different textures. I grab my hairbrush and start brushing my hair. Oh did I laugh, I was having the absolute best time brushing my hair! Just laughing at myself laughing while brushing my life away ahah it was the best hair brushing I've ever had. Feeling basically whole again after that. I had a weird sensation in my lower abdomen and lo and behold it was my bladder. Almost forgot about that thing. Definitely drinking all the tea and coconut water so I went pee and did plenty of laughing while doing that as well. I Looked at the bathtub and figured why not! So I put a bubble bar in the tub. What a sensory experience. Water is incredible on mushrooms and it smelled so wonderful and lots of bubbles!  Absolute bliss. I dissolved into my bathtub for maybe a good hour? I'm not sure how long it felt like forever. My kitties kept me company and I cant remember everything at this point. Lots of hallucinations. Patterns, emotions, thinking about my life remembering random things, people from long ago.
