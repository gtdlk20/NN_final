Its at this time that I decided we should go out for a walk for fear of running into my girlfriends dad and not being able to hide the fact that I was being ripped off the face of the planet and thrown onto another strange, beautiful world where everything moves and everything glows. After much conflict with our own vision and work at getting ourselves to move, we prepared for a walk. Her father was home by this time, and talking to him was hard, simply because we couldnÂ’t hear what he was saying. Somehow we told him that we were going for a walk and would be back soon.
