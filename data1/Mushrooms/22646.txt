Religion: There is no Institutionalized God, who represents warfare of humans and materialistic values, who is an interpretation of others, but that of an already placed God that is before us. We are all children to Mother Earth. The Earth is here to provide a materialistic state that Humans must encounter to develop a mindset and possibly carve out an appreciation for the Earth. There is a mediator who is in control of the Earth and other planets. He controls the universe, it is safe to say that there are many Gods by our definition of higher beings but all are mediated by a single Deity.
