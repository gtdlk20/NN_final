I had a strong sense duality and contradiction towards myself. It was nearly impossible for me to make concrete observations of things, because it seemed as if I was trying to see everything from every point of view possible. I felt that everything had a sort of flowing balance that I had to try to keep sacred. I felt that at the time I wasnÂ’t there to place any type of judgment, but to absorb, and try to comprehend everything that was happening around me.
