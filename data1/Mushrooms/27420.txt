I was amazed at M's dish-sized pupils, and ran to the bathroom to see my own. I had always avoided looking in the mirror on psychedelics, since the 1st time, but now I was fascinated. I used to feel fear and revulsion seeing my face appear in stages of decay and unflattering mutations. But now, my massive pupils and glistening whites stared steadily back at me as I saw my flesh age, decay, rot, and repeat the cycle. This was deeply significant for me. I felt my fear of aging and death loosen its hold, lessening my attachment to this mortal possession, as I sensed that the divine energy/light within could never be extinguished, only transformed.
