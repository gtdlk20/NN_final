I sang my melody to the forest as I approached, as though to greet the trees within and let them know I was coming and that I meant no harm.  It was meant to both prepare them to encounter me unexpectedly in their realm, and to protect myself through a buffer of humanity.  I made my way along the small, winding path much as I had in the garden; I greeted the largest of the trees and was even more humbled by them; instead of being in a small area of contained nature in a human village, I was a small area of contained humanity (my buffer) in an immense and probably rather hostile forest.  The festival grounds themselves are built alongside a quarry-- vast forested land rent apart and gouged out of the Earth, then hauled off-- so of course any spirit in that place wouldn't like humans much.  I tried to show that I was different.  I apologized for the actions of my kind countless times, grieving with the land and the trees.  Though they were rooted in the ground, stationary, they conveyed that they had a close bond with many of the trees which had been killed.  This new form of communication was a little overwhelming.
