It was during this delusion that I fell asleep.  I woke up feeling embarrassed at the ridiculous things I had said to my girlfriend, making her worry so I wouldn't feel so alone.  I felt mentally drained during the day, but fondly remembering the better parts of my trip.  I'll definitely eat mushrooms again, but probably not alone, and probably during the day.
