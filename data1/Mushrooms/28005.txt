Backstory: My boyfriend and I had been dating for about 8 months. I am a fairly experienced psychedelic user, while his first times using mushrooms and LSD have been with me. So far the trips weÂ’d had together had been overwhelmingly positive, though not of overwhelming intensity. For this trip, we planned to spend a summer day in a forested area on the Northern California coast.
