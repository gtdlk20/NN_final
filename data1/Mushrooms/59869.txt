I began tripping on my hand a bit, holding it out, and watching it turn to a rubber-like texture, and then looking at a plaque with a religious inscription my deceased grandmother had given my brother. The plaque started glowing and I saw weird characters burn into the plaque, like old arabic or hebrew or something.  I felt my grandmother was trying to contact me from the grave and it was a very rewarding and spiritual experience.
