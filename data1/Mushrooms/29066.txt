What was so disgusting about it? At the time I was really into the show Dexter, and my mind came to an important realization. I was Dexter! How could I have forgot? How did I never realize that I was a serial killer? I must have killed someone and left the body parts lying around outside. How could I have been so careless? I was for sure going to be caught now. But what could I do? The realm outside of my tent was still another dimension I was incapable of entering. I would have to wait it out before I could clean up my mess.
