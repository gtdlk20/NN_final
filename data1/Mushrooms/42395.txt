We laid out in a grassy park nearby to Brads house and decided we would look at the stars in the sky until something noticeable began to happen.  By about 12:50 the sky was getting a bit fuzzy and we both had an overwhelming energy to express something deeper than laughter.  We stood up and walked to an intersection with the most vivid green, yellow, and red lights I had ever seen in my life.  Like flies to a bug zapper we strolled over to the nearest lit object in astonishment.  There was a hospital on that street corner, a very large complex.  We found ourselves in the hospital parking lot, because thats where all of the lights were.  We sat down at a bench, thinking back on it, we were just begging to be pulled over.  We probably looked like the most suspicious characters ever.  I remember getting a phone call from a friend, and at that point, something happened.  Almost like a conscious crossing from one reality to the next.  There was a fire hydrant nearby and as though the energy we were harnessing at that moment of time was too much for our physical surroundings, it BURST shooting water 20ft in the air.  I didnt even double think this, we just looked at each other with the widest eyes and it felt as though the fire hydrant exploding for absolutely no reason directly in front of us was a metaphor for what just took place inside of my own mind.
