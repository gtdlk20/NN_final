He started to feel great and I knew exactly what he meant, it was how my trip started out. But by now things were extremely distorted for me, my body didnt feel or look like it was mine. I laid in bed in amazement at how strong this was coming on, maybe about 45 minutes to an hour after I had taken them. My reality became unrecognizable My reality became unrecognizable, I felt completely dissociated from my body. I was absorbed into the fabric of the universe and felt indescribable. It was terrifying yet extraordinarily amazing. I couldnt feel my body, everything looked jumbled and colorful. When I tried to touch something I couldnt feel myself touch it of feel that I was using my arm. I couldnt really do much. It occurred to me that S was having the same trip, but on a much lesser dose.
