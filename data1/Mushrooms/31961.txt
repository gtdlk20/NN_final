It had been a long time coming.  Finally, a good friend of mine came across some Liberty Caps. Up to this point I had exhaustively studied the fine details about the psychedelic experience.  I had logged at least 70-100 hours of Terence McKenna, along with reading many experiences.  My curiosity had arisen with the onset of the Internet and all of its appendages, particularly YouTube.  The amount of information I was being exposed to in my early teens drastically changed my outlook in life.  Life became more meaningful, purposeful, fulfilling and quite confusing.  My curiosity for eccentricity led me into the wondrous world of psychedelics.
