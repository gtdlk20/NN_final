Keep in mind we were already at like 15,000 feet above sea level. We started our drive to the volcanoe and along the way I was staring out the window watching all the plants. They were perceived as little alien lifeforms, all with some sort of almost worshiping demenor gazing upwards to the sky, the heavens, whatever as if looking for answers. Throughout the drive I began to notice almost everything has a very upward apearance all as if they were reaching for the sky. We drove farther and stopped to shop fer knick knacks and what not. I bought a llamma wool benie that I saw weave itself. It was like the threads were all little snakes crawling into shape and what not.
