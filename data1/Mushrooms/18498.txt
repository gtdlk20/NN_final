I came to the realization that the very core of consciousness is the ability to name things, it is the unit of thoughts (like: oh theres a flower!). And to do that, one needs to do two things: to differentiate and to generalize. To differentiate to set them apart (lets say: a flower from a stone). To generalize to make assumptions, predictions and statements (The flowers wont be there in winter.). Differentiations can only be done by assigning properties to them (The flowers are colorful, temperature-sensitive organic beings. Stones are grey, mineral things.). Generalization is then done along the properties (Flowers are all things that are colorful, organic beings.) Assuming, that theres no natural order or set of properties made for mankind by nature, we also had to define the properties (Color is if it looks like when you look at a forest in autumn compared to when its fog.). I was puzzled because to define properties, one needs already a concept of things (or how would you know what a forest or fog is). I really thought thats the big mystery and the godly nature of mankind that we make the decision to structure. To say: this is this color and that is not. And that it is amazing that we all come to pretty much the same set of reality. I remember that a friend of mine told me about the concept of constructivism and I think it merged with the first few pages of Terrence McKennas Foods of the Gods which I read recently and the classes in political economy that Im taking. But how all the inputs synthesized almost by themselves and in such a high rate was truly amazing.
