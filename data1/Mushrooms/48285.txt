We stoped at one of the girls houses so she could pick some stuff up. I waited outside with the others, and that was when I really started to hallucinate. The street lamps all glowed different colors. We started walking back to my house and every street lamp we passed was a differnt color to me; red, green, yellow, blue. It was really amzing. the grass all was a deep red. We stopped around the corner of my house and the girls sat in a shopping cart they found and layed on the grass while I paced back and forth staring at the sky.
