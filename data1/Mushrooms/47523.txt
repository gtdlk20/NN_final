We got an 8th from someone that we split on a mini pizza at around 1pm at a bench at an elementary school. We walked around and played acoustic guitar as we started to come up. I played a song that went exactly with the wind that was blowing. It was really weird. We walked into the field and began to laugh hysterically. It felt soooo good. We lied down in a field and stared at the sky. The clouds began to zoom around and changed shape. I began to get a little nauseous with a body load and felt like stuff was crawling all over me in the grass. So we got up and went into the woods behind this school. We found some weird campsite where kids had been drinking recently. We sat there playing with the objects there.
