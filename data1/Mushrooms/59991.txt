With my eyes closed and the fractals dancing to the music, I hit what I can only describe as the peak of the experience. Suddenly the music faded away almost to infinity, until I could only barely hear it. The fractals dissapeared from my view and I was floating in an empty void. Remembering back on it, I couldn't even feel my body. I couldn't remember life, being alive, or the concept of existence. I just WAS. Presently I understood that the blackness I was 'seeing' was an empty sky. I waited for what seemed an eternity as blue and red 'stars' appeared in the blackness to keep me company. The sky filled with these stars and a blue cloudy mist that looked much like the Milky Way on a dark summer night. In an instant I could feel myself again, but not where I once remembered being. I was laying on a bed of soft grass. My arms were spread out to each side of me. Above, and around me, statues appeared. They looked like the kind of statues you would see in a church, with serene faces and hands against their chests in prayer. They were all positioned around me in a circle, and seemed to be looking down at me. Suddenly the stars in the sky exploded in showers of red and blue dots, much like fireworks do. As the exploding stars faded from existence, so did the rest of the world. I was, for the moment, back in reality staring at my friends basement ceiling.
