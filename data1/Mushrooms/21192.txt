A voice spoke. I felt its giant presence but saw no physical form. I donÂ’t really remember what the voice sounded like except that it felt universal and cosmic. Like it came from everywhere near and far. It was fatherly but not anything like MY father. More like some kind of giant oracle. It was relaxed, confident, graceful, and undemanding. It was clear to me that it only had loving, understanding, and healing intentions.
