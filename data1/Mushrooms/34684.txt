Muppet Treasure Island was playing, and A kept saying 'Island of the druggies' and 'This movie has it all', into his tape recorder. I kept seeing weird patterns and images floating and swimming on the walls, in space, around things that were printed on boxes. I went into another room, and there was this wooden snake which I clutched to my body and held near my mouth. It felt like rubber, EVERYTHING felt like rubber. My face was soft and squishy, and my hands kept moving without my brain telling them to, usually around my mouth and nose, or the back of my head. As I was dancing on the ground, the rest of the world left and disappeared. I kept trying to explain to B what it was like, but without verbs it's really difficult to explain a thought, and coupled with my ADHD, it was impossible to stay focused on one thing anyway.
