Before we turned it on to listen to it for the first time, me and Guido ate our mushrooms, about 3 grams each, and chewed them well. His little brother (we'll call him Joe, and he too was a Juggalo) came along to our house to listen to the CD as well for the first time, and watch us eat mushrooms. Joe has never done drugs besides smoking weed and because of his immature additude, we prefure this. And he thought watching us be on these things would educate him.
