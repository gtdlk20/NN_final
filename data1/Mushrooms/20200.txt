Within five minutes I was feeling the first effects. Muse and I were sitting outside on my balcony when I began to giggle. This was not a giddy giggle, but more of a nervous and frightened giggle. I had never felt so much from mushrooms in such a short amount of time. There was already a pronounced pressure on my chest, and visual disturbances were becoming more intense with every passing moment. I knew that this was going to be a long and hard trip, most definitely harder than any of my previous mushroom experiences.
