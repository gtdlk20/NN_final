We walked four miles, until I was almost sober again. Before stopping in, we went to the park again, and sat around the fountain in the dark and held hands. It was beautiful. When we finally got to the house my feet were practically bleeding from the sandals hurting them. But I was happier than I'd ever been. I felt a oneness with everything. I loved everyone and everything. I was at peace more than I have ever been in my entire life.
