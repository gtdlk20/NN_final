My brother was home on leave from the military and was staying with my boyfriend and me at our house.  Because psilo. is not detectable in urine tests after a few days, my brother and my boyfriend and I all decided to trip.  We lived in the perfect house for using psychedelics, it was isolated and full of weird paintings, drawings, clip-art and such, with a huge backyard and a separate garage.  We bought a bag of beautiful long-stemmed mushrooms with brown caps and white gills.  We'd fasted and stocked the house with orange juice and fun toys beforehand, and the ringer/answering machine was shut off.  We'd also resolved not to answer the door if anyone dropped by.
