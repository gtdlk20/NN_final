Another realization, more practical, thrown into sharp relief by the psilocybin experience, was this. Take small steps, but take steps. This seems so obvious, but for a type A personality like me, too often held inert by the prospect of imperfect results, it was liberating to understand this axiom more deeply, as a real-life expression of mathematical limits. It became so clear and livable! This small lesson has stayed with me and has yielded fantastic results in my professional life.
