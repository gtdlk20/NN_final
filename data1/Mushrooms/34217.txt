This trip showed me that no matter what, people will always just be people, and that I am not above or below any life form on Earth (including Earth herself). To this day, I really don't get mad at people, because, they are just an animal that can talk and where clothes, nothing more. I can forgive people so much easier now, I can sort my problems with a person out with them face to face, in a calm, respectful manner.
