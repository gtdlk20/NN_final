We went through a creek to the golf course, and started walking, it was so odd looking with the sprinklers and so much open space, there were strange looking people in all the windows of the houses, they all looked so unhappy, but I was happy and that's what I cared about. We made it to the top of a hill and I had not a care in the world. I was almost completely down by now, and me and my friend just chilled and we each drank the last 2 beers, and started to walk home. When I got home, my parents were really happy that I had no more metal in my head. I said goodnight and went to bed.
