I couldn't fall asleep though. For some reason it felt like there was a big hunk of steel in my pillow case. I fluffed my pillow over and over but it was still just jammed in my face. Because I was so tired and so stoned this really really hurt, but I couldn't get rid off it and I had so little energy that getting out of bed was unthinkable. Finally I figure out that there might be something under my pillow that was doing this, which normally would have been my first thought but the shrooms had disadvantaged me. So I reached my arm under my pillow and pulled out one of my cat's toys that I had place under there earlier for whatever reason. Just as this happened I realised that I was starting to come down. It gave me a great sense of relief that I could now rest comfortably, even though I was to screwed up to actually sleep.
