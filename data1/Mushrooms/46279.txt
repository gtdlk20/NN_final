After some pointless wandering around the rest of the building we returned to the Seal tank at 2.15pm because Cathi wished to see the Seal expert who was meant to turn up at that time. This time at the tank though we werenÂ’t interested in the actual seals at all. In fact the whole time us 6 were gathered around the side of the tank without any seals while all the other visitors were at the other end. One of the cool things were the rocks. They made all sorts of shapes for instance one looked like it was definitely a chicken. Me and Tim soon came to the conclusion that the centre boulder was in fact the foot of a dinosaur. This dinosaur had survived in AQWA for the past 165 million years and was at least 50 times the size of any other dinosaur ever discovered. Of course for this theory to work AQWA had to have existed since the same time which we quickly agreed that it must have. We then discovered the most magical thing about AQWA and the seal tank in particular. If you pressed your head hard against the glass and looked directly down you could see rainbows in the algae on the floor. This kept us entertained for quite some time.
