By 2100 I was definately up, although not yet at a plus 3. The music sounded incredible and the urge/will to dance was strong and proved to be highly enjoyable. Everytime I blinked I would have the freezeframe of the stage surrounded by lights on my eyelids, with the familiar red and green shading with patterns over peoples faces which I also get from shrooms. We carried on dancing until about 0200 where we sat down to socialise with people that we hadnt seen for a year and smoke some weed. My friend had decided to go back earlier as he was feeling some nausea, however I felt fine with no ill feelings at all. The DOI didnt apear to have any of the downside that I link with amphetamines (jaw grind, paranoia, sweating, shaking etc), there was a definite sense of clarity and lucidity with conversation freely flowing and a sense of being right on the ball, with a very trippy edge to it. Around 0500 my lady and I decided to retire to bed to get some rest, if not sleep as the main music had finished and we were starting to feel cold. The DOI didnt warm me up as speed would have, but then again it didnt make me sweat either.
