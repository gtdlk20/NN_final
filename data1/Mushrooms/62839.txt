Dose was prepared by steeping the mushrooms in water for about 30 minutes, pouring the water into cups, then adding honey.  This is my favorite way to ingest them, because I don't really taste the shrooms.  Each cup was estimated to have 1/16 oz.; I didn't even finish my cup and I still had a good trip.
