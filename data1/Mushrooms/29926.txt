The dead end road had gorgeous, majestic rolling hills towering at its foot. Wes and I raced up the first, dodging snake holes and cacti. The heat felt like a separate drug unto itself, it hit you so damn hard. Real or imagined, I spied a patch of cloud covered shade at the top of the tallest hill. That combined with the lure of a probably incredible view drew me like a magnet.
