Then I peaked on my 2nd dose, the one I should have saved. I stopped singing and dancing at some point and I looked around. My mind was beyond the definition of insane. Everything was one and I felt like I had traveled back in time physically to a shaman ritual or something. I suddenly felt the need to isolate from the circle for a while. I waved goodbye to the few people I had established friendly bonds with since arrival to the new circle, then I left. My mind was so fucking fried I couldn't tell what direction was what, which way to go to get to the main area, let alone my camper. There was this fog all around making me blind but I was hallucinating it, it wasnÂ’t white, it was the same color as a shadow with a kinda static texture to it and it was silently vibrating and twitching.
