The effects came on for me within 15 minutes.  Light headedness, relaxed muscles, and a desire to sit down and sink into a beach chair overwhelmed me.  We got it together and took the boat out to the middle of the lake and watched puffy clouds spiral accross to sky.  Beautiful blues and contrasting sharp whites enveloped me.  The scene looked like something out of a time lapse photography.  All was calm, until my friend started ranting about seeing the devil's faced shaped within a cloud.  Him screaming, 'i see the devil!'  wasn't something I could take at the moment so we headed back to shore.
