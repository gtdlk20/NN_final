(Here's where Don Juan's description of #3 power comes into play:  It was also intoxicating, to think I was in control.  But that was a contradiction to just do what I want to do.  No, I am aware for a purpose, and that is to use the power as a tool that is borrowed.  Fsck existentialism, LOL.  The humility was refreshing and connected well).
