Including the Mother section and the quotes above I made certain assumptions. When I felt the suffering of myself and Mom: [How much longerits sohard., My voice broke from the emotion. Soon, She promised. Sohard., I repeated.]  I concluded that Gaias suffering was included in the shared pleading emotion. If anyone is Jesus wishing to refuse the bitter cup he must drink (the crucifixion), then it must be Gaia. Look at her suffering as we rape and gut Her, or at least acquiesce to it. Meanwhile She just takes it. Sure there are earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, storms of tornadoes and monsoon hurricanes. How many of these can we really say are Gaia fighting back or avenging Herself. Sure doesnt fit the mother profile. How many of these are actually man made with HAARP and coal seam mining, electromagnetic, tectonic and nuclear weapons testing? How many are simple geological reactions to human intervention or just natural cycles? Just a thought.
