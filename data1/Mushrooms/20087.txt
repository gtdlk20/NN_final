By this point, I felt somewhat dreamy and floaty; nothing concrete, just a general, mild sensation.  I felt happy and energetic as we went off to explore the island.  I felt myself moving to music anywhere that I heard it.  I was heavily analyzing my perceptions, scrutinizing them for any of the effects that I had read about.  If I stared at the street or any patterned surface for a few moments, it began to roll and stretch like a calm sea.  Speaking and hearing spoken words began to feel somewhat alien.  I had to pick each word very carefully.  I remained very happy and upbeat, even though my friends ended up working themselves into a pissy mood.  I felt a sort of swelling in the back of my mouth that was kind of tingly.  We just walked around for about 2 hours doing typical tourist stuff.
