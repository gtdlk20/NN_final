I must say that when I am shrooming, I must be in a place with nature. Otherwise I feel out of place and left alone. So we walked down to the little lake. And began our adventure there. We stared at the water for what seemed like forever. Just watching the ripples, and ducks. Listening to all the noises of the night. Loving every single aspect of all living things. We stayed by the lake for nearly 2 or 3 hours. We peaked there at about 1:30 or 2. Peaking on mushrooms is sooooooo amazing. I felt like I was in my own little part of heaven. Just enjoying every single second.
