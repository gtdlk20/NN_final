Learn to ritualize movements so that I can learn them well, move slowly, deliberately, become more aware of my movements.  Simplify.  Get to know the things Ive got so that each of the things I have and use I am familiar with.  Get small bags for each of the things I want to carry: a bag for a pipe, a pipe, a bag for each  different smoking mixture These things became obvious to me as necessities on the path that Ive chosen.
