So, this time I prepared myself the best I could. I quit using nicotine, quit drinking alcohol, switched to an all meat and greens diet and hardly drank coffee. I also began taking a daily LionÂ’s Mane supplement which has really helped with mental clarity. Trying to be the best version of myself seems to be a very high priority right now and man did all of this preparation pay off! I had planned the evening with my wife and she would be my sitter. Finally, I was ready to go.
