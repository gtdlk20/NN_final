I waited for my husband to come home from a cow pasture near our house and bring me the mushrooms. I had previously asked a student of oaxacan psychelic usage who told me mushrooms are used by some pregnant women in that culture. And that they are not seen as dangerous for the baby or the mama. So I tried them. They were 7 mushrooms medium size in average.
