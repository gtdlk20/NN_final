On this night I had my first experience with hallucinogens, specifically some psilocybic fungi that my friend had given me.  I waited until the rest of my family was asleep, then I went to my room, got out the mushrooms, and picked out the largest one in the bag, about 3 grams worth.  I put it in my mouth, chewed it up, and held it in my mouth for a while; It tasted horrible, so I went into the kitchen and washed it down with some water.  I went back to my room, lay down on my bed for a while, and waited for my trip.
