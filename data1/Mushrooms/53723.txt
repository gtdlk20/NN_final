My family owns a cottage in the muskoka lakes area; it is a modest house on an absolutely breathtaking lake surrounded by coniferous woods. My family usually goes up there around august, but this summer i decided to venture earlier and meet some friends at their cottage just across the lake. I brought up the essentials for my partying: liquor, pot and fungus (about 10 grams in case anyone else wanted them). But to my surprise, my friends were not at their cottage and i was forced to spend 2 nights alone. The first night i rented a movie and had a couple drinks with it, followed by some good, old-fashioned sleeping in.
