This was the best and also most intense of all of my shroom trips, and it met and exceeded every desire I had ever hoped to experience on mushrooms. It was so different and separate from my other trips because for the first time, I couldnÂ’t pass off the things I was seeing as effects and visuals caused by a drug; I was firmly of the belief that either reality had actually changed or I was seeing reality as it had always been.
