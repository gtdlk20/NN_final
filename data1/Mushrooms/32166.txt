When we finally reached the top of the path, we noticed a lot more foliage and grass along the road. At this point, I felt my body want to move much faster. My velocity continued to increase. I looked at Friend #2 and asked him if I could run. He nodded. I sprinted down the grassy path and it felt as if I broke through a barrier. The wind rushed past me and the shades of green grew brighter as I ran down the path. I only stopped once I reached where the path split into four different directions. My friends suggested we hang out there for a while.
