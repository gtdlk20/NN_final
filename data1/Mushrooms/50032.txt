In a surprisingly short amount of time I felt a definite change in my perception (I always begin to feel my mushrooms within the first ten minutes. Of course I also always take them in the manner described above, or in a tea). The world was beautiful! I was incredibly happy. While the visual aspect wasn't exactly apparent, I could see tiny details within the world around me. While gazing out the window I saw a little yellowjacket hanging on to the screen. I got up close and stared in amazement at this creation. It wasn't moving, and I was sure that it had passed on. I sat and mourned for the pest until it finally flew away. Once I realized it wasn't dead I was overjoyed and cried tears of joy for the bug's new chance at life.
