I live on an island in Southeastern Alaska surrounded by natural wonders that render the poets speechless. Growing up here I began, after high school graduation, between 1973 and 1975, experimenting with Clearlight LSD and had many (I mean many) experiences of profound beauty and wonder. I approached this phase of life thoughtfully after reading Huxley, Cohen, Leary, et al. As a young man these experiences left indelible impressions in my mind. I have no doubt that LSD raised my native intelligence significantly at a critical time in life.
