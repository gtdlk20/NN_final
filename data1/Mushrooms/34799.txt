T+2:00 - Amazing visuals especially with all the lights and people moving. I had gotten advice not to come here when I told S I was going to come here and do shrooms but I'm so glad I did it's amazing. We went back to the record store and I bought a new cd so I could listen to it in my discman, music is a great thing in combination with mushrooms, at least in my opinion. I've been talking up a storm with S for about 15 minutes now, I was talking before then, but I've gotten quite emotional now. We started having a conversation about life and what we are going to do after high school and such.
