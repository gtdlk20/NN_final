My eyes were working. I was seeing objects and shading, but nothing was in focus. 'hmmmmm,' i thought. 'how did these eyes work again?' I started 'doing stuff' with my brain and finally moved my eyeballs. 'that's IT! i can focus them! i can move them,' i thought, excited. I focused on whatever was in front of me, and noticed that I was on the ground next to the couch. I made a noise, kind of a 'gurrg' and saw my friend move. I focused on him and saw that he was laying there peacefully, with his eyes closed.
