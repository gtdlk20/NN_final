However, after hitting this bottom, I felt a wonderful peace, helped by my reading of Hesse's Siddhartha two months earlier, as I recalled the river scene (though I certainly don't claim to be enlightened). I felt that it could never get any worse, an idea that was very comforting. I went out and sat in my hallway for a while with almost no conscious thought (similar to the meditative states that I have achieved) for long periods of time until I decided to go sleep.
