I walked or tried walking rather to the front hut (its this thing where people sign in before they enter the club).  But on the way there though I started looking at people and I know it sounds weird but I was getting their vibes.  Let me explain, this girl walked up to me named Jaime who I had had sex with the weekend before.  She started talking to me and I could tell just by the way she was looking at me that she was upset I didnt want to date her. I could tell she had this longing for finding love.  After I finished talking with her, Charles the other lifeguard walked up to me and I could also pick up his vibe too, when he talked to me I could tell all he wanted was for people to like him and not think he was different. Jaime and Charles did not hint in any way at these things I picked up on, I could just tell, I swear to you.  I did that the whole rest of the afternoon, just talked with people and picked up on what their mindsets and vibes were.
