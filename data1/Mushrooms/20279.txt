This was coupled with a sense of the mystical/Taoist/Buddhist/Hindu/Huxleyan (the Perennial Philosophy)/Schopenhaurian idea as reality as undifferentiated and one, and the ego as an illusion - thus, 'I' don't exist. I had been reading and studying this philosophy with great interest for months and had sort of adopted it. Usually, this idea struck me as very positive and good, but on this trip, the idea was VERY negative to me, although I still directly sensed the truth in it. I was left curled up in the fetal position on my bed for what seemed like forever while hating, fearing, and pitying everything. Finally, I hit rock bottom with a complete self-loathing and an understanding that I was insignificant.
