The day before the session, I had serious second thoughts about my choice of guide, and phoned two different friends to talk about that. One, who had never done mushrooms themself, said it sounded like I was taking a reasonable calculated risk. We joked that the worst that might happen was that I would become permanently convinced that I was a frog. I asked them to call and debrief with me the next day, and if I was still a frog, I'd answer and only say, "Grrribbit!"
