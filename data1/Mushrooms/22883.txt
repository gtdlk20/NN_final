The nausea was reaching a point where it was becoming physically painful rather than mildly annoying so I sat up in an attempt to alleviate it. This helped slightly so I got off the table and began walking. While walking I was staring down at the grass because it seemed to me to  be arranging itself in geometric patterns as I moved. When I stopped to examine the patterns more closely though, they would disappear. The visuals were transitory at this point in the trip. I do not remember exactly what I was thinking about, but I do remember that Jimmy Eat World was still playing, specifically Gotta Be Somebody's Blues. The music was starting to become fascinatingly enjoyable to the point where I was having trouble recognizing songs. I was noticing sounds that normally my brain filtered out. The patterns in the grass were also becoming more organized and more permanent. Additionally, the fuzzy edge of my scarf was visible at the periphery of my vision and while I was walking it seemed to me to be a large white spider ambling along just to my left. Although this scared me at first, I reminded myself that it was a hallucination and told myself to welcome any and all figments of imagination that my brain would throw at me. I'd actually read someone else's trip report where they imagined the world as a gigantic spider with all of us people as billions of eyes on the backs of its head. This thought crossed my mind and I wondered if on the course of this trip, the mushrooms would take me to meet some sort of imaginary spider deity.
