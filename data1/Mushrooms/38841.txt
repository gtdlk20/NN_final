I had to pee constantly, which was a good thing because I could go out of THE ROOM for a moment (back to reality in a way), it was sort of a cord to real life. My body wasnÂ’t important and I had a feeling of no control athough I could go to the toilet, pet the dog and see my body. When i was back in THE ROOM, i kept thinking that I could piss all over me or not and I kept checking if I had but this wasn't negative at all. I also realised that I had agreements with myself, rules that I could use for connecting to consensus reality. Sometimes breathing loud, tapping my foot or changing my position. Time was cut up totally, it stood still, there were only 3 different clock times I saw during the peak that lasted 2 to 3 hours. Although I kept looking at the clock, the clock stayed the same. My consciousness kept going in and out of time, reality shuddered, wondering if it was the movement of my eyes that caused this.
