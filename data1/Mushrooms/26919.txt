'Lord' was actively, or in real time, destroying bad thoughts and fears as they emerged.  Well the fears are the anxiety with social situations that I normally feel.  It would quickly and with ease destroy my fears from the root of my consciousness (to the best of my explanation).  It was like a psychological subconscious reconstruction, or remodeling of the interior is a good way to put it.
