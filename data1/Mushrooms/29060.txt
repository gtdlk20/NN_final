Where it led me next, I have no idea. It felt as if a million experiences had passed over me, each one more significant than the last. A few lifetimes later, I could hear G and L talking in their tent beside mine. This seemed to snap me out of it momentarily. Had they returned from the festival? Did they even go to the festival? Were they even really there? There was no way of knowing, or communicating with them. They were in another dimension, a very separate dimension from the one I was in. The sounds that my mouth emits are not capable of travelling through dimensions I thought, so trying to talk to them would be a pointless endeavor. Who knew if that dimension even really existed?
