Syph was holding up a bowl with my weed in it, and even though it tore me to leave my secret exploring place, I didn't want them to smoke it without me.  I slowly waded out into the now-frigid waters.  I went under a couple times, but it was too cold and I had to keep my head above water most of the way.  I pulled myself out of the water still glowing from my experiences in the water and across the river,  and we all smoked the bowl of kind.  I began hiking toward the ledge, but it must've taken me half an hour to get there, with all the detours I took for exploring little nooks of the woods.  I sat on the back side of it, looking down the path I had come up.  I wanted to jump again, but I was too cold, so I sat in the sun.  Sugar joined me, then Syph and Clock.
