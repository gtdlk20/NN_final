P left at around 4 in the morning, feeling paranoid about not being home in the morning when his parents wake up. He lived just down the road, so the drive wasn't long. The next day he told me it felt like a video game, but that it wasn't very hard. I went inside, still feeling weird. I put some music on really low, and I thought that it sounded wrong because I had just been used to the music so loud. This left me a little unrelaxed, and it took a while before I could finally get to sleep. MJ and Bob Marley works like a charm for relaxing in such restless states.
