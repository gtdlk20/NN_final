T+15...I think about walking around to settle myself down, so I tell P I'm going to go over to the porch light. I start to feel light-headed and light-weight throughout my body.  I try to remember something I read about walking around at the onset of a trip, but my mind is taking a passenger seat to this feeling in my guts.
