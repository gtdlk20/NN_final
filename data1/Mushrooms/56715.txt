My last trip was about 3 months ago, so I was ready to feel good.  However, I did not know what was about to occur.  About 45 min. later I started to feel my trip coming on.  Right at the beginning I knew it was not going to be good.  I was afraid to look at anything and just wanted to close my eyes.  My friends were all wide-eyed and happy while I sat there with eyes closed.  I dont know why I was so terrified and I could not stop it.  We all then went into my boyfriend's room and sat and listended to music.  This is when it started to get really bad.  My mind took over and I could not control anything.  I sat curled up in a ball telling everyone I was going insane.  And I really thought I was.  I started to cry and shake.  My friend Mike who was trying it for the first time and my other friend left and went for a walk but I could not move because i was so terrified.  I constantly felt like I needed to pee but I couldnt.  My stomach hurt incredibly bad and I felt like I was peeing myself but when I went to the bathroom nothing was there.
