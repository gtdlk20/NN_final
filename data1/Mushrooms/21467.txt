At some point, I mumble (from here, language was becoming laborious) that I think I've already reached peak experience--thinking the crystal dimension was probably the most intense thing I would encounter--and in the middle of her reply, I was lost to another experience, so I do not recall what she said. I will call this experience the 'surrealism cycle'.  In this experience, I became a flesh-colored cactus with no spines, but the cactus branches were more like tentacles. One one branch was my jaw bone. On other, an eye. Above my eye, my eyebrows stretched and became something like a rooster comb, but pointed and stiff rather than floppy. My other eye on another tentacle, etc.  Where my feet should be at the base of the cactus was a blue bicycle wheel.  I was completely lost in this experience, and it blotted out reality. I have no idea how long it lasted. It was alien and disturbing and intense, though it was not frightening.
