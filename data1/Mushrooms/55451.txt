I got a lil worried as my thoughts were getting different, and my 'me' feeling was dissapearing. There was no base feeling. I took a walk, and I couldent really think of anything too deep, as my memory and mind were unable to think of anything complex. I threw some pine cones at ducks and headed back to base camp. I layed back down and told my friend to take a walk and I would watch out stuff.
