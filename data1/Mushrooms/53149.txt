My fingers were in contact with something warm and soft, like the fur of a bear, and this added to the feeling of security (I did vaguely realize that this fur was in fact K's hair (!), but that had no meaning whatsoever). I was floating, floating, floating... But as soon as I became conscious of what was happening, the feeling of utter happiness subsided. I could still sense what had happened, but no longer felt it. The blue world seemed to slip away. The song ended, and the next piece brought with it a light green world that was filled with flute/violin music. I could actually see the blue world leaving me, fading into the distance below. A helpless longing filled me; I did not want to lose touch with the blue world, but knew that I had. I felt like crying, but no tears came. I felt sad, helpless and alone. The song ended. The next piece of music transported me into yet a new world, into a series of new worlds, in fact. Every time the music changed, I entered a different world. I have only vague flashbacks of those worlds, one of them being a beige one, where beautiful flowers danced ballet wrapped around one another...
