I remember someone saying, You may take LSD but Mushrooms take you. I definitely got taken for a ride.  I feel like Ive been through the mill. I have a slight headache, likely due to light sensitivity to my computer but otherwise I feel good and sharp. I dont think it gets more spectacular than what I just went through. Im glad it only shared its good side. I dont think I would want to do a dark side of this but I seemed to be able to manage it with breathing exercises and positive thinking.
