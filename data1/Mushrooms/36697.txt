My mind was storming; I heard doors opening and the contents of my head roared out for me to see I could hear thousands of whispering voices talking above what sounded like a wind storm rushing through my head, listening to my friends talk was driving me crazy on top of all the other chaos and confusion.  My brain must have been fried becuase I looked totally ripped, I was so confused by the simplest things that I began to just disconnect from the world and float off into another little reality I had discovered that was 'real', closing my eyes I could see this new world, I could smell colors and see emotions like pain or sadness, but I had lost my mind very literally.
