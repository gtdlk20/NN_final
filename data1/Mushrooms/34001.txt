Ace had gotten a hold of an ounce of mushrooms through a friend, but wasn't even sure what they were supposed to look like or if they were even good. He brought them to me, since I had done them before, and I informed him that he definately got a great deal since the bag consisted of a large amount of VERY LARGE caps. I had never seen caps this big before, probably almost 2 inches in diameter. We decided that we wanted to eat these before going to see the new 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' on IMAX. We recruited my younger sister and her friend to be babysitters and drive us there that night.
