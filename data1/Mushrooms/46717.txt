The next ride was Air, another rollercoaster that is designed to make you feel like you are flying. The queue was quite long, we had a good few giggles and the guy in front of us looked liked a woman, we think we may have been a bit obvious with our chuckles, but we didnt care. Just as we got to the front of the queue M seemed to be coming up a bit stronger, which delighted him beyond belief considering he thought he was as high as hed get. The ride was fantastic, the sky looked so beautiful, I screamed I can see God as we twisted through a corkscrew. We landed.
