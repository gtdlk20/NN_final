That night we joked around together and had some of the best genuine conversations since we had first met. Along with being goofy, I talked very expressively, using small words, which intrigued and entertained her, seeing such an exaggeration of my character. My ego barriers were down and I was completely open to be my unrestricted self; enjoying to express care without the fear of being rejected; saying things with body/facial expressions without fear of judgement; all with good intentions because I was very sensitive to the vibe. Bad vibes felt bad, and I loved feeling good!
