The trip peaked with thought loops and discomfort.  My feet were freezing, despite the room being 75f and under covers laying on my couch!  I had asked myself/my feet, what can I do to help, and got no answer.  Thoughts about motivation would come and go, but there was no catharsis- just fleeting ideas.  I was seriously feeling like maybe these issues were always going to be there- because I myself have been too lazy to try to work on making things better.  You could say that I sort of gave up on seeing any progress at this point and accepted it- no matter how crappy I recall it feels in everyday life.  I decided to just go with the music playing and told myself that these thoughts running wild were not really me, but this hyper critical part of my ego that was not constructive to me working on myself.
