At another point I was staring at my friend and the whole room turned into ethereal light. All I could see was white and some green light. I was completely outside of time and space, it was some heavenly realm, free from all suffering, free from all constraint, I was no longer of this world, of I was outside it, transcendent. My friend turned completely pitch black. I didn't know if it was a good or bad sign, but I took it as Shiva in his form of god of time. We were at the the end of time, it was one of the most divine moments of my life. We were at the the end of time, it was one of the most divine moments of my life. Like the transcendental peace and freedom.
