T+3:00 - About this time I'm thinking to myself, 'This has to be the peak, it can't get any better then this can it?' Visuals are out of control, every color is more colorful, every light is brighter with an aura of colors. We then go outside and a car drives past and leaves a trail, another goes the other direction and leaves another trail of cars and my jaw hit the floor and then I started cracking up. I felt in control of it all though, and I noticed I was in fact somewhat in control of things. It was now a little after 7pm and as dark as the ny area can be any given night, I looked up at the stars in awe. The color aura on each one had a given color, a single color and they were constantly changing, but in a pattern I noticed. And then I thought well I don't like that pattern and looked at S to get his attention up, the pattern changed, and then changed again and again. We noticed it might look suspicious two teenage guys standing in the parking lot staring at the sky in awe, we went back insde, it was somewhat cold out tonight. Me and S were having one conversation after another, he didn't seem to mind, he's the kind of guy I can talk about really deep stuff with and we have a lot in common so it was great.
