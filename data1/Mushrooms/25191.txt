I was asked the time by a woman and found it difficult to remember what I had to do to answer her (look at my watch, tell her the time). I wanted to tell everyone 'this is all fake' and to 'examine the real world behind it' but there wasn't anyone to tell, and my reserve had slid back up again to prevent me from doing do. Once I'd walked the three miles to the town I felt sufficiently back to reality to get in the car and drive home.
