T:2 hours, after much confusion we end up at the end of the park and the beginning of the beach and a fun fair, etc, We met another friend called T and proceeded to the pier. When we arrived at the beach my visuals were amazing, everything moved in an un-natural way, for example, the water twisted in a spiral motion that made me feel as if I was turning inside out. These types of feelings expanded into completely distorted vision, a small window of vision that repeated when I changed where my eyes pointed, and constant echoes of my friends voices and laughter & my own.
