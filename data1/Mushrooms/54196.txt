I had an experience about 12 days ago, with 3.2g of dried whole cubensis (golden teacher) and it was fun, new, warm, awesome.  I did kind of pass out though when going to the bathroom, waking up with a small glitch of reality, but luckily safe and not hurt. There were none of the time loops or mind fscks came to me, despite being interested in them.  Good effects but felt like there was something deeper to be wanted.
