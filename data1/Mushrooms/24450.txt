Me and Chris couldnt understand this and I tried to talk her out of it. I was still in a euphoric state, and I said Being afraid of an empty corridor is as absurd as being afraid of an inanimate object like a cheesecake! but even as I said this I began to feel uneasy looking at the expression of fear on Kellys face. The prospect of being afraid of a cheesecake seemed more and more like a genuine possibility. So much so that when Chris picked it up and jokingly thrust it towards my face a jarring spike of physical terror shot through my heart. It was there for a split second and was gone. I remember thinking how absurd this was at the time but the feeling was still very real.
