We sat at a table near a big, bubbling fountain. Jimi played the apropos desert rock album, Bright Size Life, from his portable speaker as the sun made its glorious descent across the horizon. Wes soon joined us, Manny appearing shortly thereafter. The splendor of the sunset dazzled our senses. Nature truly was a wonder to behold. So wonderful that now, 5 hours in and decidedly on the comedown, I still wasnt ready to leave the natural world.
