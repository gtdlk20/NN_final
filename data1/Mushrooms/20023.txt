Although my eyes were firmly closed, I could see just as much as if they had been open. That is to say, I was way, waaay beyond the cartoonish level of 'closed eye visuals', and had entered a fully realized, three-dimensional dream world. The sheer oddity (for lack of a better word) of what I saw was enough to produce intense, all-consuming fear. I lay and watched, in stark horror, as quivering, mutating undescribable _things_ stared back at me. These alien-like monstrosities had dimensions and proportions that were utterly disturbing (think H.P. Lovecraft style monstrosities; the sort that are alien enough to lay outside of the spectrum of human imagination). My mind felt as though it was failing, as though it was viewing that which it was not equipped to handle or comprehend, and I just lay there, shivering, convusling and completely gone from this world.
