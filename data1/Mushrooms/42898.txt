I personally have only used drugs to interfere with a psychedelic trip once, when I had no other choice, and there have been some instances where I wouldve liked to have that choice, but didnt have any access to sedatives. What Im trying to say is that I only do this as a last resort. With experience, users may actually learn how to help guide a trip; theres several tricks that a turn a trip around in a hurry, either way. This goes back to set and setting. If you or someone you know starts to feel uncomfortable during a trip, it may often just be something minor that youre neglecting because youre so caught up in the trip at hand: change the light; change the music; change rooms or go outside; have a drink of water, or some fruit; use the bathroom.
