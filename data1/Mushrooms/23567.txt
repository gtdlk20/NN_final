I saw one of the small gardens nearby, and I decided to go visit it.  Stepping under the vine-covered trellis at the entrance, moving slowly the garden path, it seemed that every plant was infinitely more alive than they normally were -- like the regular breathing of fellow humans lets you know they're alive --  and they were capable of motion, thought, and communication.  In the flowers and leaves, I saw faces and figures -- spirits of the plants.  I was so amazed at seeing them, that I felt very humble and greeted each of them in turn.  In response, I received images, ideas, and emotions from them, like a sort of telepathic communication.  Such joy!  I felt a different presence around me then, deity-like in scale.  The words nothing is too small to be worthy of consideration came to me.  I was awash in reverence for the living things around me.  The scope of my universe widened even as my attention focused in on its many small residents.  All things were sacred; nothing had ever been more clear to me than that was at that moment.
