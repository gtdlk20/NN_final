11:00 p.m. I dont know why, but I thought Trevor was lost. I knew he would find his way home though. I dont know why I thought that but it kept me satisfied. I went out in my backyard again and this time it was like I stepped foot into a jungle. Trevor was actually out there but I didnt seem to notice, nature was taking me over. Everything seemed so calm. The crickets were making this amazing sound. It was heaven to my ears. Then my attention went to the tree leaves. This was a cool part. The leaves looked as if they were falling from the trees, but in fact were not. They had this continuous fall to them and it looked so interesting. They just kept on falling, but moving no where. We went in.
