And then it was over.  I reached my plateau and with a start I sat up.  I felt at peace with the world and I knew I was okay.  I went back into the living room where my boyfriend and my brother were laughing hysterically while they played with the cat.  The music (Stereolab, I think) was soothing and cheerful, and the visuals were stunning.  We went outside where the moon was full and danced around in the backyard like lunatics.  I kept saying 'He's got mushroom fevah!' in an Eddie Murphy voice, and we couldn't stop laughing.  Finally, after about 5 hours of a beautiful trip, I began to come down.
