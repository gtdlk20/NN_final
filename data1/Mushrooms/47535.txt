G met up with me later there like it was some fantastic movie. We walked around town together and I felt us bump into each other a lot and it felt like we combined momentarily. We got some more pizza and just chilled. The come down was amazing. I contemplated so much. Theres so much more I dont know how to put into words or describe. A lot more scary things happened that don't stand out anymore because the rest of the trip overshadowed that with its amazingness. We got sweatshirts and chilled around the school for a few hours talking at night. I felt really close to G and that we had experienced something amazing together. Later my friend A demolition-derbied her car into another one by accident in the parking lot just to top that day off.
