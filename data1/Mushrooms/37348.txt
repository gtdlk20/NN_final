More than this, I felt compassion and empathy as well, as the shrooms opened my mind in deeper and deeper ways.  I had been out of any romantic relationship for a while, and was having a hard time forgiving myself for mistakes I had made in a previous relationship.  After talking with D, and thinking about the troubles he had with his family I realized that the love I had to give was a good thing, that I had learned from my past mistakes.  The other girl, despite being my first love, was goneÂ… and this was okay.  The shrooms told me, without words, that what mattered was sharing the warmth inside myself, and that instead of 'taking' someone for yourself, love is like watering a flower, and helping it bloom.  I felt a profound joy and relief at hearing this, and it was as if an emotional veil lifted from my heart.
