For a moment, I was lost again. The candle had been my center, my anchor point, and Goopstar had just snuffed it out! What was I going to do now? I thought. I realized this was to be the long, dark night of the soul. Like the Moon card from the Thoth deck. Only by passing through the darkness, can new life arise. In the dark, it is easy to stumble or be led astray, and the jackals that guard the gates are eager to fall upon those who have lost their way. But I soon found the darkness comfortable enough. It was so dim I could barely see the other people in the room, but it lent a womb-like comfort and intimate feeling. Terence McKenna was right. Five dry grams, under conditions of silent darkness. And we were all totally silent now, silent for a long time. WOW. ThatÂ’s the only word that describes it accurately. Just, WOW.
