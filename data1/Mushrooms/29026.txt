Really? Why would that happen? How could that happen? I couldn't tell. I looked at them for what felt like a good long time, and came to the conclusion that they were simply in conversation. I should note that the 'security guards' at this festival are just volunteers, who for the most part, don't really give a fuck about what you do. Their main priority was to stop people from sneaking into the campground, since it sells out every year. As long as you have a wristband (proving you bought a ticket) and don't set off any fireworks, they didn't care what you did. I reassured K that no one was getting kicked out, that they were simply in conversation and probably knew each other. He seemed troubled at first, but eventually agreed and we went back to our campsite to see what everyone else was up to.
