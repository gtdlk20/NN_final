I continued with intense visuals and very deep and twisted inner exploration. Then around 4 AM, I started putting 2 and 2 together and getting 5. My parents had decided to sell their business, their house, and buy a smaller house. Somehow I thought they were preparing to die. I was completely sure of it. Why would they make these sudden choices? I was completely sure that they must have had some bad news from a doctor or something of the sort. I kept grabbing the phone and thinking I was going to call them. I rehearsed the call in my head for a long time. It kept going over and over. The more I thought about it, the more I knew that there was something they werenÂ’t telling me. Finally around 5:30 AM, I decided it was close enough to morning to wake them up and ask. This is where having somebody else with me would have been useful to stop me from calling. So I called and they insisted that they were making decisions solely based on financial reasons and not health. I apologized for waking them up and they never knew I was tripping. Residual effects continued and I drank some beer to try to finally get some sleep.
