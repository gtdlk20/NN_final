Around 3:00am - From time to time people would get up to go explore other parts of the house, and when they returned it was like they were re-emerging from a dark world of mist and snow.  I cannot remember when I finally left the living room, but eventually Mark and I went upstairs to his bathroom, as I remembered from the last time I tripped that this bathroom was really amazing to explore.  It has three movable mirrors so that you can reflect yourself seemingly forever.  I remembered reading that mirrors can be really great while tripping but might also be terrifying.  I watched my face bubble around and morph and emit colors and at first felt a little frightened, but quickly discarded such feelings.  I knew that I was just on a drug and there should be nothing to fear.  Mark eventually left the bathroom, and I was all alone just staring into my face and the room behind me.
