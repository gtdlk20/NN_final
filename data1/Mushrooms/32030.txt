   Suddenly, I feel a surge of excitement/anxiety rush through my stomach much like when one is at the apex of a rollercoaster about to drop, but much more intense. I want the show to start already! My face feels light/rubbery and a massive smile comes across my face as my attention scans across the room. Such diversity! I begin to chuckle out of nowhere when a couple of my friends look at me and I cover my mouth so as not to seem loony. They understand though. At last the line starts to move and we enter a dome with a magnificent screen flashing images as everybody begins to find seats.  We are handed 3d glasses, oh boy this should be interesting. We take our seats with a pretty clear view of the screen and as I look at everybody filing in I have this awareness/knowledge that everyone is focused on different things at different times. Hmmm Anyway, the lights dim to a dark blue and a speaker tells us to put on the glasses, I decide not to and instead watch as everyone else around me scrambles to place them on their eyes in a sort of synchronized, predictable, but fluid like manner. I immediately laugh and thoughts regarding cause-effect and entropy flood my mind. But no time for that yet, lets get on with the show. Tonight they are playing The Best of Pink Floyd. I peer through the glasses and the laser show begins.
