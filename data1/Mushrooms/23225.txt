I entered the house and joined my sister on the couch. I attempted to sit there like I wasn't on the verge of a panic attack and watched her and her boyfriend laugh at South Park, which was featuring Satan figure skating and burning things. I couldn't believe how awful the world we live in today is and couldn't endure the trip any longer. My sister and her boyfriend retired to bed, and it was when I was alone in my room did things become horrifying. I recall the feeling of being completely alone. I looked at my computer and saw the words on my friend's away messages, stating 'Happy New Year' as the words melted down the screen.
