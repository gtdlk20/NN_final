Satan Encounter- My fan in my room instantly spawned a flaming Pentagram when I lie there dead. Satan appeared then from the pentagram, but was merely a face, and went right up to me and laughed and then went away. I was not afraid, and the entire encounter lasted a very short time. This encounter was highly symbolic to me; even today I see it as a comical thing, something that can be laughed about when thinking about. Satan, as shown to me, was like a face of a coin that is true for all of humans, in that his image is promoted for fear, but this image was one that was of understanding that Satan is nearly a figment to make people act morally.
