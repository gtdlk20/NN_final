As a teenager, with all the accompanying hormonal and emotional handicaps, I was not happy. Being a relatively ugly person (in my own eyes) and going through the aggravation of my parent's divorce and subsequent dual domestic life, left me drained, depressed and sad. This all happened at about the age of eleven. Whilst my parent's tried to retain a mature and dignified approach to the situation, I was not receiving the love an attention any adolescent requires. I hated life. I wanted to escape. So, I got high.
