Over the last hour I spent in awe as I was some entities, in language and tone like none other, this is where I gained all the knowledge I learned previously before the trip had began, I was being reborn a new. I got my first glimpse of reality and taught myself to see and recognize where I was , who I was, and what I was doing. The visuals were still very intense, but I was back in my room rather than flying through space, so that was a relief in it own. I found my headphones and put echoes on, I drifted into a deep sleep somewhere towards the end of the song.
