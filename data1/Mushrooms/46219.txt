J had to be the responsible one and take L back on the two mile journey to the house. He says that once he got back to the house and regained his composure he actually had a nice time on his own and saw some pretty visuals. Unfortunately for the rest of us we came crashing back down to earth when he fainted (or 'greyfaced' as we refer to it now). N, C and I sat on some benches slightly away from the shop and I tried to regain my composure by putting some make up on and attempting to look normal. I felt very guilty for coming to our friend's tranquil island home and making a holy show of ourselves in front of all these people who surely knew each other and would notice the bunch of tripping tourists in their midst. N said that she still felt very euphoric but couldn't think about L greyfacing or else she would be sick and would feel very negative. C denied that she was getting any effect from the mushrooms, but I could tell from her behaviour that she had started to feel very euphoric and jittery and was behaving in a more carefree, childlike way while we waited for J to return. He did, and we met up with some others and walked down to the beach. Swimming, climbing, eating barbeque and just hanging out on that beach was one of the best experiences of my life, but I think it was definitely one that I felt sober throughout. I did wish that we had waited until we got to the beach, which was fairly secluded, to take the mushrooms, as I think we would have all had a better experience.
