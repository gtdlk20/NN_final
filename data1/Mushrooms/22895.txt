This train of thought continued for awhile until the song ended and In the Closet began. My first instinct was to skip the song because it reminds me of a few times when I felt like Justina (the girl I'm in love with) was trying to make something physical happen between the two of us. But since my mood was still forceful and confrontational, I instead decided to play the song and embrace the sexuality of its message. After all, I also come from a long string of lovers. Every one of my ancestors managed to procreate, so it stands to reason that somewhere down the line there were romantics, lovers and hopeless fools caught up in the ebb and flow of love. Telling myself this, I threw down my book of poetry and I began to dance. I imagined Justina in front of me and I danced my heart out. I was aggressive, sexual and caught up in the nature of my desire. At one point I looked at the city skyline and saw a Jaguar's eyes staring back at me from the horizon. I remember how sexual mushrooms had been in past trips and so I named him the Sexual Jaguar. I almost picked up my book and started walking away during a lull in the music, but then the song started back up. So I threw my book down once again and decided to give all my attention to dancing. The song did end eventually and I did pick my book back up, but with a smile on my face in lieu of a snarl. I'd reassured myself that I could feel the playfulness and aggression that are so integral to sexuality and are so absent from my relationship with Justina.
