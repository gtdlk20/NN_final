At around 9pm, I chewed the mushrooms. Chewing them for about 2 minutes then swallowing. I had T.V,PS2 and Gamecube for entertainment and orange juice so I would have something trippy. About 40 minutes later I felt a buzz going on. At about 10:10pm while watching family guy, the colors began to get brighter. I looked at the wall, a single line spread across the wall, the line spread out like a wave and began to make zig-zags on the wall, when the zig-zag lines had spread out, one more wave shot from the middle, out of the wall and the wall started to breath, giving life to it instantly. The world had become my domain, all up in my brain. My mind had been released and was showing me the real world. Everything was alive, everything was moving.
