While listening to 'Black and White' by Three Dog Night, I had an intensely vivid memory of hearing the same song while riding in the passenger seat of my father's old Datsun wagon, circa 1990.  I could see the small pits in the windshield, the cracked vinyl, and the mismatched interior panels as if I were really there.  The experience left me with a refreshingly positive feeling.
