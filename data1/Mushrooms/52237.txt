I was on holiday in Amsterdam with three mates.  None of them had experienced anything psychedelic before either.  We had travelled there for the pot 'cause we are all huge smokers.  Although we had talked about taking mushrooms, it wasnÂ’t something I was going to go out of my way for.  Despite this, the first evening we got there, we found ourselves in a Smart Shop.
