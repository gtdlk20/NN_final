Casey and Chriss were watching and entertaining Lisa and me for a while. Casey had found a broken chair from the food court that only had two back legs. He sat on it, and held his weight on his front feet, so it looked to Lisa and me as if he was floating. We were so bugged out about the fact that we couldn't figure out how he did it. Both of us attempted to float like Casey did; yet we both fell trying. The entire time we were laughing our asses off.
