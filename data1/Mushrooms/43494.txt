For the rest of the night I was still tripping hard but starting to come down. I felt happy and at peace with myself. I was glad I felt all those feelings. I handled the sadness in my life and dealt with it in one night. I feel more happy then I've ever felt in my life today. Everything seems so happy and loving.
