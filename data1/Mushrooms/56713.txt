One day out of the blue, I decided I wanted to eat an 1/8th of mushrooms.  My boyfriend at the time, me and two of my other guy friends all ingested them quickly swollowing them down with orange juice.  We heard the mushrooms are much more intense when ingested with Vitamin C.  It was one of my friends first time taking them and he also took 1/8.  We will call him Mike.
