I woke up this morning feeling extremely hung over and definitely not all there mentally. I still remember vividly what I felt last night, and I hope I do forever. After that experience I have no desire to acquire marijuana or any drug for that matter. I feel like Ive gotten what I wanted out of the trip and I feel great about life. S and I have no regrets about what we did but we both agreed it wouldnt be happening again.
