So what is the moral of this story?  I know its cliche by now, but never underestimate the power of your subconscious when it comes to psychadelics.  If your mind is suggesting you shouldn't do something (as it did when it gave me sustained and uncontrollable jitters), then you would do best to listen.  This isn't saying you should become its slave, but just keep in mind that it will have a greater effect on a tripping than it does on a sober one.  What got me through more than my experience with acid (which told me that my entire body wasn't being poisoned, but instead there was the nausea and the intended psychadelic peak seperately) were the friends with me, one being sober and the other showing no signs that the mushrooms themselves were tainted.  Always be mindful of the setting and remember that it includes both where you are and who you're with.
