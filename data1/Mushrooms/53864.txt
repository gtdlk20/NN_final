In a short time I felt very hyper and zonked out. For two or two and a half hours I felt kind of bad. I decided this was going to be one of those times when I wouldnt ever get past the rough phase and would not feel good (usually the rough phase lasts about 30 minutes), but then I suddenly started feeling good. After eating a little bit of seafood and smoking a cig I felt very good. The first night I did not shake the tea jar up, and I wonder if maybe some potent mushroom matter settled to the bottom, because that second night I got higher than I expected to. I drank the rest of the tea, but that was at most half of what I originally had, probably less than half.
