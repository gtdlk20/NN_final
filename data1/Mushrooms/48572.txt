Just like my first experience with mushrooms, it comes on very subtly at first but then hit me like a train; lines on the walls became wavy and colors intensified, music sounded better and I drifted away into a higher level of consciousness. Relaxing music was put on, and we all just sat around and laughed and talked for a while. I laid on the bed looking out the window at the purple/blue/pink sky, the trees laughing with me and all around, with the music coming from the walls. When I finally got up, I felt like I was swimming through the air; this thick gooey mass of colorless ooze, and gravity showed up at random points in time and space. At first, I started to worry about myself and how deep I was willing to go, but after a while you I just had to accept that the mushrooms are taking their course and I might as well enjoy it. Time began to die, or at least fade out until only random moments of reality could feebly to grasp my slowly-drifting consciousness. After the 'point of no return', I began to just relax and roll with it. Standing up and moving wasnt something I could will myself to do, it was a completely impulsive action. Some interesting things were said, and meanings of words were dissected (comfortable, pain, etc). Everything became quite hazy, with everything seeming so abstract and surreal, but not in a blatantly obvious way; throughout the night I felt like I was an observer in a movie, that it didnt matter what I said because the world was already ridiculous, but I still had lucid thoughts and made decisions, but they werent as interesting as what was going on Im my head, so I didnt pay as much attention to my actions as normal.
