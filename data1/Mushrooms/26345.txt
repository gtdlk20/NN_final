12:20am - I was starting to come down and we went to another dorm room of one of the friends who was tripping as well and the 5 of us sat in there.  Lifesavers were very interesting because of the color and they were the first things I tasted.  I painted the flavor on my tongue by moving the candy around and absolutely experienced every bit of it.  They had made some macaroni and cheese, which seemed to fit the experience and the noodles just melted in my mouth.  I was sitting on an inflatable yoga ball that felt amazing.  I felt like I sank into it and it flowed around me.  The whole theme of liquid and flow seemed to keep recurring in my trip.
