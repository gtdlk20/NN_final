I was with my about 5 of my friends who were all planing on taking mushrooms together. We were all at our friends house and we took the mushrooms at about 10:00. I took an eighth, and the rest of everyone else about the same. About a half hour after eating them, I could feel the effects slowly come on. But by this time everyone else had already started to see some visuals. I hadn't yet. Out of nowhere everyone got really wierd vibes, and started to act wierd and leave to other rooms. So I was left with my friend Nny. We wanted to go on a walk, no one else did so we left. As soon as we walked out the door, I started to shroom harder immediately. We walked down the street deciding on where to walk to at 11:00 at night. All the cars passing by were so bright, I could hardly see. But everything else I saw was so intensely different, and just looked wierd and different from normal. We ended up walking to my apartment to hangout outside by a little lake thingy outside.
