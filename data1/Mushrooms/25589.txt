The night wore on and the stars danced willing us to stare at them. We eat the hash cake and our gums burned. It was dark, wet and cold, I kept tripping over all the crap we had left on the floor. I couldnt see anyoneones face, I felt confused it was time for bed. If I could just get someone to skin up for me, theres now way I could do it. Ache went to bed first muttering curses his eyes burning with paranoia. Communication had broken down (as it always does when the Psilocybe wears off). I finally got a joint rolled got into my sleeping bag and knew no more.
