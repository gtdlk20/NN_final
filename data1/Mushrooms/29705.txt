According to M, I spent an hour following my initiation of the lotus position screaming my head off. When he tried to quiet me, I bit him hard. Following the demonstration of time, I began to scream inside of my head as well. As I was losing my mind, and was on the fast track to psychosis. The mushrooms realized this, and began to say comforting affirmations, telling me that I was loved and was safe, and that I had not in fact died and instead I was being healed.
