I sat outside and talked to myself and the trees about life for what seemed days. I listened to the wind telling me of what people all around the world were doing, and how every person had the same exact right to do whatever it was they wanted as long as nobody was bothered, and that if anyone could do what they want nobody would need to bother anyone else. I realized that all humans have little things that they allow themselves to become obsessed with, and when they could incorporate that obsession into their work life they would be happy with their jobs. I thought of my girlfriend, and how badly I wanted to take her into this world, how well I knew she would be able to understand it all, and how I absolutely knew we would have trips that followed each other.
