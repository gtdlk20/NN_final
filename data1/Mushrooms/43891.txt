We were coming down at this point but the high was still hitting us in waves, but much less intense than before . The disorienting, confusing fog had lifted and we were enjoying the scenery. We'd switch back and forth between having laughing fits over things we were talking about and then back down to kind of stoned feeling lows where we were just feeling kind of tired and drained. This whole high wave experience persisted through the entire rest of the trip. I remember at one point my friend was telling us a story. I was feeling very stoned and had trouble concentrating on what he was saying but once again shortly after a giggling energy wave would hit me again.
