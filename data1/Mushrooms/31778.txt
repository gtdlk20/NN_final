M was relieved to see me sane again and so we drove home instantly. As we walked into the house, I noticed that I was still having subtle hallucinations. The furniture looked stretched and it gave a sort of Alice in Wonderland feel to everything. Everything looked the same but some of the furniture was smaller and some of it was larger. But I was exhausted and so we went to bed.
