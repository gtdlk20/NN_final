Some background about me might help make sense of this. To begin with, I'd noticed my own consciousness when I was about 8 years old. I remember asking, "Why am I me?" and feeling surprised and uncomfortable when I realized that my older brother, from whom I expected an answer, couldn't even understand the question. I concluded that I was the only conscious being in the universe. The universe was a single player game, and I was the player. Direct experience told me that the most real thing, in fact the only real thing, was my own experience, and logic told me that therefore, without me, nothing was real.
