I laughed and asked her who she was talking to: my eyes or the hand that was holding the glass. From there I really got puzzled: if I wanted water then why was my hand holding my glass? And if my mouth said I wanted to drink then why had my hand stopped drinking and why were my eyes seeing my hand and mouth arguing? Then I realized that I had to co-ordinate my mouth, hand, lips, arm and my WHOLE BODY to get a sip of cold tap water. After a half an hour (I literally couldn't concentrate enough to move my hand) I took a sip and I was BLOWN AWAY how the water went down my throat. It was the most amazing thing ever as the cold water poured downwards.
