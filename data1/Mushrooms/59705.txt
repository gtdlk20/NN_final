Sept. 18    Inoculated 11 - ½ pint jars with two strains of psilocybe cubensis, Puerto Rican and Treasure coast.  ___ jars were Psilocybe Cubensis var. Puerto Rican and ___ were Psilocybe Cubensis var. Treasure Coast.  Originally I planned to have twelve jars but at the time of inoculation I realized one jar was very water logged and I assumed very fucked up.  I didnt use the jar, but I prepared fresh substrate.  I seem to have misjudged the size of the needle I would be using because the holes in the lids were to small and I had to force the needle into the lids, bad idea I know but I am confident enough in how sterile my surroundings are and with my work.  Also, in one jar while I was inoculating it, the needle became clogged, rather than pull it out and re penetrate the cake, I forced the plunger to go down and it slipped a little and injected 2.5cc of Puerto Rican spores into the cake.  Another cake, while injecting into the second inoculation site caused water to come out of the other hole.  I assume this cake is water logged and will not work but ill give it 10 days to show growth, if it doesnt, ill clean the jar make fresh substrate and inject it with the 4ccs of treasure coast I have left
