Thats when I snapped too and told my friend I needed to go to bed, I couldnt stay around him anymore. He is a good friend of mine but I was seeing him for who he really was which wasnt really positive. Then my body was trying to explain to me that he was coming into my life and I was seeing it from the outside. Like I was watching a movie of me and my life only very abstract. (This whole time we were sitting on my porch)
