1:30am - The main act Plaid finishes, absolutely incredible. I had been dancing and enjoying myself, feeling like I smoked 10 blunts although no marijuana had been ingested. In fact, I did not smoke the entire evening, since the event was on federal property. The owner of this NASA facility comes on stage with a tall black wizards cap and a staff and starts talking about how we're going to the moon and mars soon. At this point I start to notice that I'm tripping harder than I ever have in my life, as the guys face on stage is distorting and I can't understand a goddamn thing he is talking about. I hear mostly gibberish with relevant words spliced in as brief moments of clarity, similar to past LSD experiences.
