I felt a deep companionship to a few good buddies and felt that they had to know.  I told all my close friends I loved them and called a few more just to tell them.  I had a powerful urge to just hold someone in my arms.  I felt a strong love for Emma and couldnÂ’t help telling her that very second.  With these feelings of love and happiness came a strong spiritual sense.  I was never a very religious person but this night I felt as if I understood everything about life, death, and God.  I realized that the time we have on Earth is nothing and our lives will be over just as quickly as they begun.
