I get a mild degree of synesthesia, though at the time I didnt realize how unusual that seems to be at such a relatively low dose. The first way it manifested was by touching my face  if I covered a portion of my face with my hands, the appropriate portion of my visual field would suddenly seem to have much more red and yellow in it. The second way was by music  the song that was playing seemed to affect the visuals, but in my impaired state I would only notice it after ages when the song would change, and all of my visuals would abruptly switch together with the music.
