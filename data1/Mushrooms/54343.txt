Allow me to talk about the trip of 5 months ago, which was  the "15 gram trip", as this was almost exactly like the "35+ gram" trip of about a year before, but more defined and more detailed.  The "35+ gram" experience was scarier and more soul destroying but the later "15 gram" experience pulled everything into focus properly.  I had been crying for about a year after the "35 gram" experience but after the "15 gram" trip, I actually finally managed to integrate it all properly after the "15 gram" trip, I actually finally managed to integrate it all properly.
