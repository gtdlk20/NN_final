I finally fell asleep once the hallucinations had subsided around (t+6:00). This morning I feel different. I intend to take an indefinite break from smoking both marijuana and cigarettes. I feel the need to eat healthier, to exercise, and moreover to take school more seriously. I want to cultivate the bonds I have with my friends. I want to become closer to life, as I was so close to death (or at least the desire to take my own life) last night. Though I've tripped quite a few times previous to this experience, I have never taken so much away.
