Past lives and communication with the plant world...these were more than I expected, but I was grateful for the experience.  Each time I've tried mushrooms has been in a completely different environment.  I'm amazed at the variety of experiences that can result.  I feel like I could use them both for simple pleasure/recreation and for some serious personal exploration.  I have gotten so much of them already after only three trips at relatively low doses, that I'm almost afraid to increase the dose and have an even more intense experience to absorb.  I see immense potential.  I could say 'where have these mushrooms been all my life?' but I know that only now am I ready for them.
