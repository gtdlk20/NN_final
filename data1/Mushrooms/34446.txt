I start making faces, My lips melt off my face and down to my chest. My eyes are the size of CDs, my eyebrows are 3 inches thick and moving and wiggling like catapillers crawling all over my distorted face. I bring my fingers to my face and touch my cheek. My cheek ripples like a stone being thrown into a pond and the ripples of flesh moved across my face. I step out of the bathroom with a big grin on my face and as soon as I look at john I don't even say a word and he gets up and goes into the bathroom to look at himself in the mirror. A few minutes later he steps out of the bathroom with a big grin on his face also. It is about 7 O'clock by now and my other two friends D and L are feeling the shrooms. It seems as if we know what everyone is feeling and seeing, it is as if all 4 of our minds are connected on such a deep meaningful level. We all look at each other and just stare for a moment, then at the same time we get up. When we all get up at the same time we realized what we have just done so we all start laughing.
