So a few friends had now gathered at P's table in his rustic cottage next to a picturesque estuary, and night crept in as we imbibed. I would feel a warm, delicious high slowly rising, a merry feeling, bringing with it an appreciation for the setting, how ideal it seemed, the perfect time and place, and how lucky I was to know these men. Only B and I had imbibed, the other two men present would smoke roll ups, perhaps a joint and sip a beer or two.
