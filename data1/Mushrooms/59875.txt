I finally was able to succumb to sleep and awoke the next morning, very tired, but pretty much returned to normal. Sadly, I had to work a 10 hour shift at work that day and I dragged ass, but it was definately worth the experience. Next time I would take the day after the trip off though to recuperate from the mental and physical drain it does on the body
