When K and J had returned, we swallowed the mushroom powder with 7up and water. I had high hopes for what I was about to experience. After about a half an hour the others started to voice their strange sensations and visual effects. This annoyed me a little, since my vision was unaffected. However, I could feel myself sway in a wave-like motion, the waves moving along my body from feet to head. When I talked to the others about my lack of visual effects, they suggested that I simply concentrate on the music.
