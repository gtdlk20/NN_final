Nick has a garage-barnish sort of building they call the carriage house.  We stopped in there and smoked a small bowl.  About three hits each, to fight our nausea.  We walked out of the driveway and onto the sidewalk, each of us very slightly stoned.  We took about a ten minute walk to Crystal Lake, on the edge of Rhinebeck.  The lake was frozen solid, with a shopping cart lodged in the ice.  Margo and I sat on an overturned trash can and smoked cigarettes.  Nick and James layed down on a hill leading down to the creek.  I wondered if I would start tripping here or when we got back to Nicks.  I didnt know how long we were planning on staying at Crystal Lake.  I started to feel a little light headed.  The hills were breathing softly.  That was the only thing I noticed.  Nick said 'Do you guys feel anything?'  Margo and I both answered with a tentative 'yeah,'
