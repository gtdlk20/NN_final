Coincidentally, it was a few meaningless hours before I decided to go to bed. I endured even more hours lying in bed trying to sleep. My mentality was totally recovered, but my senses were still tainted with electronic sounds, visions, feelings and abstract thoughts that tingled my every being, keeping me from falling asleep. The faint light in my window looked like a bloodied plane flying across my visual field. My vision was filled with annoying, popping, colored neurons that wouldnt dissipate. My feeling was unnatural and extremely heightened, making the normal comfort of blankets seem like tiny, innumerable mechanic sensations that wouldnt ease. My sound was tainted like the former two senses. I finally reached the orgasmic state of sleep to the random, extremely redundant thought of half naked gray-haired man building a sand castle.
