7.	I am dying now, I feel that my time has come and everything that was holding me here was gone, I felt sad because I knew I was going to die and everyone would find me here on the ground dead. I didnt want this, I began to pray to God asking him to let me live. I prayed: I havent had enough time to do what I needed to do, please let me stay.
