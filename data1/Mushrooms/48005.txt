L, J and I purchased 30g of what were described as fresh Thai cubensis from a local alternative shop the day prior to the experience. We had experimented with standard cubensis mushrooms in moderate dosages previously and were interested in having a more profound experience. We fasted the day and morning before we ingested the mushrooms in a hope to reduce nausea and reduce the period of onset.
