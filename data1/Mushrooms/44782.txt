0:00 - First mug of tea drank slowly.  Sitting in a comfortable chair, quietly following my breathing and taking a moment to appreciate this rare and magical experience I was hopefully going to have.  I say hopefully because honestly I wasnÂ’t so sure about the tea.  I had a feeling that the boiling water may cause the psilocin/psilocybin to degrade.  So I was prepared for a mild trip.
