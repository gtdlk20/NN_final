k and I decided to go to the local grocery store.  I think that's when I started peaking.  I was wandering around rather aimlessly, not knowing what I wanted, generally feeling shitty.  When we went to check out, the goth girl at the register seemed to know we were tripping, and that just made me more paranoid.  On the walk home, the trees looked sinister in the dark, and I couldn't stop thinking 'God, I'm so fucked up, I'm so fucked up.'
