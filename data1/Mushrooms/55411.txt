I went back to my bed and layed down and this is where the visuals started. I noticed that my ceiling was moveing and swirling.It was also bending out at me along with my closet like a little man was jumping on them.Then I noticed that there was a glare on my wall in this glare I saw a face not a scary or terrifying face just a face. I then stood up agine and my chair seemed to shrink before my eyes. As cool as these visuals were they werent even half the trip.The best part I think was the felling it this peceful almost orgasmic mentel felling I seemed to be at pece with everything around me. I started thinking these deep introspective thoughts and I finally confirmed what I always thought,that money and power really dont mean shit and that humans fuck everything in this world up and we still have the balls to outlaw gods creations it pissed me off frankly, or it would have pissed me off if I didnt fell so damn good. Well that is about as far as my trip goes the experience was incerdible and id like to thank god for putting these here they truly are magic-mushrooms.
