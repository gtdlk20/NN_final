Soon the colour was very intense. We were stumbling around like two drunk fools and to be honest, I was getting a bit scared. I was trying to control the trip which is a huge mistake. Somehow we ended up at a kind of chinese temple garden. There was an expanse of white gravel which we stared into. It hummed with nothingness and gave me a similar feeling to when I'm looking at fire or into the ocean. It was nothingness though, and it hummed. We stared and vibrated silently with it- were at one with it. From this point on the trip became revelatory.
