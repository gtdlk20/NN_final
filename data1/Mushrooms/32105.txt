T+1h: this is definitely gentler than any other shrooms IÂ’ve done thus far. Very controllable/ manageable. If I could only get my body to stop trying to go into shutdown/ preservation mode. The desire to sleep is almost overwhelming. I think doing this with a friend would be fantastic. And being outside would be even better. But the music would have to come with us.
