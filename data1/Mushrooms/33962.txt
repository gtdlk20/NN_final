It was an alien encounter like no other and IÂ’m still, after about a month after in awe of what actually happened. These things were definitely separate from my imagination. They moved at their own will and possessed knowledge that is way ahead of our own. I am also certain that I am not the only person that has experienced these kinds of aliens as their attention was very much focused on the human agenda. But what were they doing to my brain? As a psychedelic visual artist, I had the feeling of being selected. That they chose me and not my friends to perform their studies on. I would love to hear other people who have experienced these same beings.
