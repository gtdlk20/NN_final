2:00 A.M. - Neither of us was the least bit tired. We continued tripping in our fantasy dream. We both felt amazing. It was an indescribable feeling. TRIPs room had taken an orange haze now and everything looked so beautiful. Everything in his room seemed to have a life of its own. Everything was breathing and living with us in our dream. Everything that one of us felt was felt by the both of us. We shared the same feelings and thoughts. The mushrooms took us to a comforting fantasy world where we knew exactly what each other was thinking. Quite a weird, unexplainable effect that we believe can not be achieved by any other drug. The mushrooms served as a spiritual guide to the both of us, guiding us through thoughts of existence, the future, and beauty.
