I then began feeling that I should do something rather than play games for the whole trip, but I was tentative of what I should do. Then I began to feel nauseous. And tired. Every couple of minutes (or even sooner) I would yawn. I thought maybe I should lie down and relax for a bit. But part of me thought that would be a waste of a trip if I fell asleep. Well I got up to walk over to my bed but then almost automatically I turned back around and sat back at my computer. Then I I thought maybe I should lie down and relax for a bit. So I got up to walk over to my bed. But then I walked back to the computer. I was in a thought loop.
