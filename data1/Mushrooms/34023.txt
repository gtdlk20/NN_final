We all decided that it was pretty late and my sister's friend dropped us all off at home. Ace and I went straight to bed where he passed out snoring almost immediately. I, however, lay there with my eyes closed and could feel my heartbeat in my brain. I began to freak out and think that I was dying and could see my soul floating above me and watching my body die. I am not a religious person and consider myself an agnostic, but I was sure that I was having a spiritual experience with myself. I probably laid there like this, with swirling colors and shapes surrounding my body, for a good hour before I finally fell asleep.
