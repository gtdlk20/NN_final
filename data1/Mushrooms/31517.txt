My hands felt so good running over my stomach and I kept being drawn to my bellybutton. I thought about how crazy it was that at one point in my life all of my sustenance came from a cord attached to that point on my stomach. I felt fine when I was lying on my back with the cool air rushing over my stomach, but if I moved my stomach would begin to feel nauseous. This didnt really bother me because I had no desire to go anywhere. My boyfriend would sometime try to hold me and would accidentally press on my stomach. After several times of me reminding him about it, he began to joke about my stomach saying. Oh holy stomach, and Thou shall not touch the holy stomach. This got us talking about religion. He started talking about how religion is so trivial because people follow arbitrary rules rather than thinking about things for themselves. While I understand this point, and agree that people need to think for themselves, I could also see how some people have a harder time with that than others. Regardless of the actual existence of god, to have faith in a higher moral power would be the best way to achieve goodness, because god is an individuals ideal of goodness (That was actually a marijuana high thought from earlier).
