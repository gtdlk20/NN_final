After casually smoking a joint, my friends and I retreated to a safe haven, for in my pocket there was a little baggie full of magical mushrooms.  Rather anxious to take them, I felt spiritually ready to see where my mind would soon take me.  At about 1:30 pm, I began to eat the mushrooms, washed down with orange juice and starburst candy.  The effects came on rather rapidly, or so it seems because as they were kicking in I was watching Tim Leary's How to Operate Your Brain video.  This was the second time for me to take mushrooms, so the onset was more recognizable.
