Everything began to look as though I had never seen it before. A group of trees I have passed by hundreds of times before looked foreign and almost intimidating, even though I knew where I was and whos trees they were. Then, all of the sudden, It hit me like a freight train. I felt an intense surge of energy, happyness and wonder, followed by another, and another and another. Each surge would leave me feeling so incredible that I was certain the shrooms had reached full effect, but another surge would soon follow. I felt confused, content, incredible, energetic, and adventurous. Nader and I decided to head over to my friend Pauls house, normally a 10-15 minute walk, mainly as an excuse to give us something to do and stuff to look at.
