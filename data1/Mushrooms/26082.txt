Then, for the first time, I felt the 'mushroom entities' very distinctly. One was mocking me, calling me a coward, saying something along the lines of 'Not so tough now, are we?'. I remembered that several times I bragged to my friends that with my extensive trip experience mushrooms couldn't really hurt me anymore, and I felt that the entities might had been insulted by this, and thus striking their vengeance upon me. I apologized and asked 'them' politely to leave me alone, but they were determined to teach me a lesson. (However I did clearly feel a 'female' entity, which said something like 'Don't be so hard on him' or something, and somehow my tripping mind gave this entity the face of an ex-girlfriend of mine who cared about me alot but who I rejected.)
