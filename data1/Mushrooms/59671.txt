He started to tell me how he missed his lost family members and I was still tripping myself noticing that the sky was chnging color and the clouds where comming in to ingulf us. I watched all the trees bend As I wanted them to and for some reason was saying things I didn't even think of. I think it helped him and helped me. After all the peaking was through and we started to gain back true knowledge again we vowed never to do it again. At least for a few years or so but I will tell you this. I found god and I do recommend Mushrooms to the spiritually lost. But do not abuse it's visions. It's not all fun and games when you are taking your good friend to the looney bin.
