It has now been 2 days since the above experience, and all I can think about is how much my wife and son mean to me. Even though the experience was like a terrible nightmare I feel like it got my priorities in order. I am still processing what the mushrooms were trying to show me. I donÂ’t think I will be jumping back into a 4 gram dose anytime soon, but like always I have a new respect for the medicinal psychedelics. Set and setting should, and always be the first thing to check off.
