No words were exchanged any more, because nothing needed to be said. I sat with it and it just hung out with me until our time was up. I have no actual idea of how long this lasted, nor do I really remember when it finally said goodbye and went away. I dont even remember if it ever said goodbye. Im certain it felt no need to, as it hadnt ever really formally said hello either. I have no clue if I will ever see my cosmic buddy again, but I really hope to one day.
