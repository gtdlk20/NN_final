In order to relieve my anxiety and get myself pumped for the trip, I called my friend Nick. He and I have taken mushrooms together before, as we have with many other drugs. Nick and I essentially have a connection and chemistry that makes us feel so comfortable around each other. I went to Nick's phone number on my cell phone's speed dial and I called him up. Nick thought it was incredibly brave that I had taken such a large dose, and I agreed with him. He eventually decided that because I was going to be tripping, he should get his 2 grams of mushrooms and take them as well, alone, in his room, while talking with me on the phone.
