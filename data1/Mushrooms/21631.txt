What did you take? Wait a second I dont give a shit. Said the doctor, reinforcing my belief that I was dreaming. I laughed to myself and thought it was funny because I know doctors dont say that to patients. I remember taking a urine test and as I was lying in the hospital bed I was staring at the reflections in the television in the room and noticed it wasnt distorting as much as it was earlier. I must have been laying there for a long time because as I was in the bed, things became less dream-like. All of a sudden a terrifying thought popped into my head. Could all of this be real? That is not possible. As the effects began to lessen I solemnly laid there, hoping that I was wrong and it was a dream after all. Finally, I see both my parents walk into the hospital room.
