I look at my friends face and I see 3 eyes where each should be with 3 on his forehead. Many things around me break into prismed patterns, and the music beings to completely overwhelm me. We're standing in the front next to the god knows how loud sound system. I try to dance but everyone around me beings to change in frightening ways. This one character wearing a pink fuzzy suit looks like he has 4 arms and no feet and is cartwheeling around me laughing hysterically. People's skin starts melting off their faces and limbs, exposing multicolored bones that look very translucent as if looking through the skin. These skeleton ravers were being sucked into me and spit out behind as I got close, although I think I was just bumping into everyone like a dumbass. Just as a person would pass me I would see their bodies sprout limbs or start degenerating or aging rapidly in front of my eyes.
