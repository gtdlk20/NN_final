It was definitely worth the 30 dollars, I will definitely take more mushrooms in the future, and when I have an opportunity I will definitely order spores. This was far better than weed, and the idea of doing mushrooms in a group setting appeals to me immensely...I hope I can get a nice sized group sometime. Next time, though, I'm shrooming with my friend that got these for me. I hope its just as good :)
