T:3 hours, I cant remember much of the past hour in any detail but I am now lying down on the sand with my mind wandering many complex thoughts. At this moment I felt something move in my stomach, turned my head and threw up. As this occurs time is completely distorted and I feel myself stuck in a kind of Groundhog Day. I could see a constant flow of vomit coming from my mouth and I'm turning round and round in the sand. When I came to a stop my whole perception changed and I was on a bright beach with strong rainbow colours. This was now my purgatory as my mind was locked in this place alone. In my mind I had died and my new world was this beach. The time frame is unknown but an eternity or a second later my friend M pulled me onto my feet and I instantly broke out with TAKE ME TO A HOSPITAL.
