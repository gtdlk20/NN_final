Monday was going to be Ss birthday, so I gave him his shrooms for free and was going to smoke him out when they began to take hold. After he ate them it started to get pretty crazy for me. I cried and told   him how beautiful life is and how were going to be dead one day. I felt like I really knew what that meant. It was so so amazing. I felt great about the whole experience so far.
