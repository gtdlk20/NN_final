The most amazing part of all this was that it felt like time had halted; school didnÂ’t matter, homework, projects, stress, all of that was put on hold as I got in touch with what really mattered. The most comforting thoughts came from that aspect; that there was a reality waiting for me but for right now I can enjoy my break from everything; and if I ever got nervous all I had to think about was what a normal day was for me; my normal thoughts, interactions, multi-tasking, everything, whereas that night everything was separate; each thought could be digested and analyzed, each movement, each sound, each image, each touch of skin could be loved and obsessed over; and then always making sure to remember to take deep breaths of the surreal air which fueled my lungs and organs and brain and capillaries and each indescribably complicated and perfect cell throughout my body and that of every being on this earth.
