When we returned we realized the waiting was over.  A vehicle was parked in the driveway that obviously was the DEA gentlemen.  We went inside and sat back down in her room expecting to be handcuffed and taken away as soon as they went into the room.  The only surprising thing about them is that they werent dressed in suites with sun glasses as I expected the agents to be, it probably takes away from there ability to narc people out.  So instead of suites and ties they had Levis and T-Shirts.
