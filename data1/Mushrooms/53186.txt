Setting was a nice cabin by a lake and mostly perfect were it not for the dreadful weather outside: the night turned out gloomy and wet. The day prior to ingestion had been occupied by various activities and on the whole the day was not IMHO the best day. I would have postponed it by a week but the arrangements were carried out because three other people were attending.
