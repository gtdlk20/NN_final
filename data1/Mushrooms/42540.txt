For some reason I left them alone completely until the cluster started.  Kind of scared of them actually, not sure why, they had always been gentle to me in the past, even the time I took 3 grams (well, maybe not gentle that time, but wasn't a bad trip).  But my reactions to other substances I had revisited after that decade (such as MDMA), wasn't encouraging.  Seems my brain has shifted slightly with either age or that akathisia.  Pretty much everything induced anxiety in the first 30-60 minutes, until settling down into more familiar territory for a little while before wearing off.  Not really worth it. Would mushrooms be the same?
