R ate his half-eighth straight, while W and I cut ours up and put them in cereal.  Couldn't taste the mushrooms at all, a good thing since we didn't like the taste of them alone.  We finished the shrooms at about 11:00, and left my house at about 11:30 (T+00:30).  By this point I was already feeling that light sensation I'd felt the first time I ate them, and my vision was a bit distorted.  Colors seemed more defined and porch lights from the houses we passed seemed brighter than usual, meaning my pupils must have been dilated.  I was the only one feeling anything at the time, and because of this I was beginning to wonder if I was just imagining the feeling.
