But over those years I have had bouts with minor depression, short periods of deep introspection and doubt, accompanied by feelings of purposelessness. I motored-through these periods promising myself that someday I would find clarity. I am also a committed Christian and have accepted that these episodes may be my thorn in the flesh so I try to learn from them. Ill admit that I am not wired like most folks, in fact some would say I am a bit eccentric, but that doesnt bother me. Having certain gifts often entails certain deficits. Besides, these short periods of depression are not debilitating and are often followed by surprising bursts of energy and creativity.
