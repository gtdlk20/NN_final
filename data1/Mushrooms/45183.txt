I have smoked ganja many times, dropped acid maybe a dozen times drank since I was a teenager (the last one's proved to be the worst habit). After all the years of boozing it up, I longed for a 'spiritual' experience hoping I could kick my drinking so I read everything I could find about psilocybin, and shorty thereafter grew my first batch of shrooms, pf-tek style.
