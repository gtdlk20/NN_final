This is when the visuals really hit me. I was looking at the path ahead, the rays of sunlight breaking beautifully through the trees. Whenever I moved my vision, it seems my X and Y axes were inverted; instead of objects ahead seemingly moving left when I looked to the right, they followed to the right. I decided this was my perception of distance and perspective fading away, and enjoyed it happily. I then remembered that if I put my hands in my pockets, it would feel like my hands were submerged in water. So I did, and convinced that my pockets were full of water, I made sure not to spill any of this precious fluid drenching my hands. I lit another cigarette, and admired its beautiful purple glow. It was at this time that W decided to write down everything I was saying on his iPod Touch.
