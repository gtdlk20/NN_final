I looked at the clock before jumping in the shower it was 2:30 am. The shower felt like the best shower in my life I felt so clean. I felt so happy that none of the things I had visualized were true. I crawled into my blankets on the ground and realized everyting I had pack for the trip was out of my bags and scattered on the ground. My friend said that at one point they hid all the alcohol from E. And E went looking for it. So when E came to me asking if it was in my bag I yelled 'Where the fuck is it lets look!' then began to throw everything I brought across the room.
