It felt like my mind and body was being controlled by a malevolent spirit. I felt like I was superior to everything, and this whole world was a joke. At one point I stood up and walked around my room. My legs felt like they were robotic ,and I struggled to walk. I also noticed I was experiencing bad muscle pain. I picked a shirt off the ground, and started laughing at how small and insignificant it was in the grand scheme of things. I then started trying to rip it in half. I struggled hard to rip it for a little bit, getting pissed off at it. It felt like the madder I would get at the shirt, the stronger I would get. I eventually ripped part of the shirt, and the noise it made scared me. I turned off the lights and jumped in bed, trying to find the most comfortable position, because of my muscle pain. I stayed in that position for probably about half an hour, feeling like my soul was completely dead. It just felt quiet, empty, emotionless. All I could do was lie there and feel 'dead'. Then I suddenly got an urge to sit up, and acted on the urge. I still was having visual hallucinations but I didn't feel dead anymore. I actually felt like I was reborn. I started laughing, feeling so good to be alive. I felt like calling all my friends and family telling them how happy I was, but I decided it probably wouldn't be a good idea. The visual hallucinations and body aches went away gradually over the next few hours. I didn't have any bad aftereffects. In fact, for the whole week afterwards I felt great. I felt like it 'defragged' my brain, making it run little better, and gave me more mental energy. I think there also could be some residual long lasting positive effect on my brain.
