The next day, after Z & Y had left, my sister and I were discussing the experience.  It turns out that she saw the golden light behind my head just as I saw it behind her head.  I went on for awhile about the Rift and all the fun I had with it.  We talked about Y, who, as she left, still looked pretty shaken.  Apparently she couldn't sleep for a long while and was pretty scared through most of the night.
