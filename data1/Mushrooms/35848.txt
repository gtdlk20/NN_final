I was going to trip with my friends M and R. They had bought some mushrooms from the same person but only had an eighth to share where as I ate a whole eighth. The setting of the place we were going to shroom was in R's room but we had to be careful not to be loud because R's parents were still around. R's room also has a door that leads outside so we could wander around his property fine.
