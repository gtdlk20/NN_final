T +2:45  For some reason I was watching CNN and I remember the TV screen was very messed. It was as if there were maybe 20 pixels and they all blended into each other. The anchor woman looked so small and disproportioned. I felt extremely fucked. How long will this last? I asked myself. The time was about 1:30AM. I turned off the TV and threw on some more tunes.
