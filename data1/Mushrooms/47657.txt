Only a couple of weeks later Junebug broke some ribs and couldnÂ’t move much. Up in his room he had a cigarette, L and A kicked him out, it was a first offense in a no cigarrete house. L and A in the following days asked me to pick sides in a few more sly words. A friend wouldn't ask me to pick sides, I picked the friends that didn't. I haven't spoken to L or A in a long while. Me and Junebug still do drugs.
