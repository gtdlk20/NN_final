Understanding the music of J.S. Bach was something I couldn't begin to do when it was suggested to me that I should do so.  Mushrooms helped me.  I believe that most things just beyond our reach in a normal state are within reach under the influence of mushrooms.  I don't know whether it's a matter of improved focus, or abstract thought, or both, but I have noticed good results.  I find that muscular control is improved; muscles I didn't even know I had control of, I found I could manipulate.  Not to mention that music is interpreted at a higher level than merely the sounds produced, it becomes more of a language.  Certain music anyway.  I try practicing things while under influence, try understanding something (art, music, maybe even math), it works.  I use this golden tool, it's never too late to try.
