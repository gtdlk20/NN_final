There's a little to be said about the condensation problem on the cakes: occasionally, small beads of water did condense on the cakes.  This is not good, but unless the beads are really excessive (a millimeter in diameter or more), I'd recommend you just leave them alone.  A few tiny water beads isn't going to hurt the cakes any more than you dabbing around the pins with a towel or toilet paper. Just keep an eye on it, and try your best to control it.  One thing that will help is if you make sure that the plastic covering is raised a little in the center of the aquarium (like a tent) so that the condensation on the top flows to the sides of the aquarium rather than dripping on the cakes.  Also, if you are using an ultrasonic humidifier, I recommend injecting the misty air close to the bottom of the aquarium, well under the cakes.
