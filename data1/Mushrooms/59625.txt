We decided to walk home after that I think due to the people around us and the ganja that we were smoking we all started to sketch out a little, and sure enough all of a sudden I was nearly completely back to normal having to suffer the hour long walk home, but knowing that the mushrooms I had taken and stimulated parts of my brain that I had never used before, a totally mind expanding experience. I cannot wait to feel the same again, this time knowing that it will come to an end, and probably a little less ganja for me I think. It's a long way to mushy season but I cannot wait.
