Between three and four hours after dosing I was still tripping, both visually and mentally, but not nearly as intensely as I done earlier. As the rugby game came to an end (congratulations South Africa!) three hours into the trip, I switched over to Stepmom and settled down for an hour and a half of mindless, American drivel. But, however cheesy and sugary-sweet the film may have been, I was repeatedly deeply impressed with the actors performances, in particular Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandons. I seem to recall that I did not enjoy watching films  or, in fact, sober humans of any description  when I used to take shrooms years ago (one of my only lasting flashbacks, that sometimes appears after smoking weed and even occasionally when drinking, springs from a mushroom trip that caused me to see humans as extremely absurd-looking, even ugly, with protruding noses and greenish-yellow faces), but this time I found it thoroughly enjoyable and not at all disturbing, in spite of finding the people to be quite remarkable in colour and appearance.
