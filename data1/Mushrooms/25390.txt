I sat back down in my seat.  I kept hearing noises around me.  Kept seeing doors open everywhere.  I saw people poke their head in out of the corner of my eye and then jerk it back and shut the door before I could look at them.  I would stare straight ahead at the movie and see my friend J's head dart over and look at me, but when I looked at him he was sitting there silently watching the movie.
