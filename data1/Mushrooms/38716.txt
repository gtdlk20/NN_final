As we were walking back, the sky had started to darken.  The cars along the road had their headlights on and there were still Christmas lights in the small trees lining the streets.  Every small Christmas light that was wrapped around a lamppost, on a fence and in a tree had a small, beautiful halo around it.  All of the car headlights had slightly glaring purple halos.  All of the the headlights reminded me of the hallogen bulbs in new cars.
