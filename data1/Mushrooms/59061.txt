Later on the green hair guy came back. We hung out with him for a little until he had to go back to work again, he told us to stop by later in which we told him we would. Remember this part later cause this involves going out into the mall (which happened once me and Lisa got bored of the hallway, although that seemed like it was a really long time later to me).
