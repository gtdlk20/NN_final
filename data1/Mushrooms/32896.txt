We went inside and Z and K both took a little more mushrooms to keep the trip going for them. I decided to just relax and have a few beers. I couldn't smoke marijuana due to an upcoming drug test. I expected this to bother me a lot more on the trip but I was fine just watching my friends. We started playing one of our favorite games Fifa 2010, which felt so realistic and great. I was basically done tripping after my game.
