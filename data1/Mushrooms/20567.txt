I got back into bed and turned off the light. Within about fifteen seconds of lying down I felt I was no longer in my room for the first time in my life. I was looking birds eye view at a futuristic looking suburbia. Everywhere I looked streets were rolling out unfurling. I was doing it. I created roads, houses, lawns. They were subtracting and multiplying. There was no perceivable boundary or edge. I tried to look around and the scope of the place I was in blew my mind. I had never perceived such a great panorama of space before. It was impossible. Then I started to fall. I was unafraid though. I don't know why. Suddenly I saw a late afternoon sun that I hadn't seen before when I created the world. Red and amber clouds rushed past me. I felt the exhilaration and adrenaline. The sun was almost blinding. Suddenly at hyper speed before I hit the ground I was yanked back into the air. Back and forth, violently like a broken record, like I was attached to the cogs of some great machine. This went on for about thirty seconds, or what felt like thirty seconds then finally I plunged through the pavement like falling into water.
