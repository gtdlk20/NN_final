Before the experience started I asked God to experience something to help me on my spiritual path. I hung out with some friends and took one and a half mushrooms. About a half hour into it, we decided to go to the beach a few miles away. I found myself at the beach. The rainbow sunset was the perfect setting and I remember having an overall sense that everything was beautiful and perfect. I was happy and at peace. On the way back to my friend's house it felt as if time was moving at an incredibly slow pace. It was as if the ten minute drive was taking a half an hour, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and wasn't impatient at all.
