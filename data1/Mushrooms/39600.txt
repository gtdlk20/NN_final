1.5 hours after consumption:  BLG eaters and myself went hiking for a change of scenery.  One effect I noticed that was different from any other mushrooms I ever ate was uncontroled laughter, much, much more than from other shroom experiances.  The type of laughter I get from N2O.  Nothing was really comical about the woods, no one was even talking or telling jokes.  We were however all in hysterics to the point that people were falling down.  (I guess this is where the name BLG comes from).
