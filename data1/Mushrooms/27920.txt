This was a scary trip in some ways- searching for the mushrooms only to find that they weren't talking to me for most of the trip, and I never did figure out what The Noise was or where it was coming from. Overall, I learned a lot about myself and those I love and I don't regret the experience at all. I only hope that next time the mushrooms will be with me the entire trip- it makes all the difference in the world.
