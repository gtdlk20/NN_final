Back in the woods we had meaningful conversations like 'What is this? What is anything? Its everything. Whats that? There. Where? There. Oh that. This. There. Haha.' And of course it made sense to us. The woods began to freak me out, as they will later too, so we left into town. Again. I began to get the feeling Id spend the rest of my life walking back and forth. Anyway we ran into these girls that graduated last year who we hadnt seen in a while. We got in their car and went for a drive. First I couldnt get my seatbelt on and wasnt satisfied until I did. They drove and we talked with them as best we could. Driving was nuts. We were moving a million miles an hour at least and the wind coming in the window was wild. We went over speed bumps that shot through my entire body. The music in the car just added to the whole thing. I heard that 'build me up buttercup baby' song, and closed my eyes and the colors were flying at me. Orange, red, and yellow zooming all over. Then the tune changed and so did my visuals to wavy purple, red, and blue. They put on MSI at one point and it made my body feel all shaky and electric like circuitry.
