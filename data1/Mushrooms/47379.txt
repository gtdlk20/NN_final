I think there are lessons to be learned here.  Firstly, inform a friend of what you are intending to do.  To have had somebody with me, even if they were having the same bad reaction, would have been an enormous source of comfort and reassurance.  Secondly, and most importantly, if you are at all unsure of the quality of your substances then don't take them.  I would not wish anybody to have the experience I had.  The choice between wasting money on not tripping and wasting money on a hellish experience should be an easy one to make.  I unfortunately learnt the hard way.
