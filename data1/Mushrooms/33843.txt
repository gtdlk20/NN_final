T +3:15  Everything was still flat. I felt so weak. I was exhausted, yet I was still peaking. I just lied down, my mind filled with racing thoughts. I wanted to just think about life and how I could improve my own, that is of course, the reasoning behind this experience. I just couldnt get the thought of, I am messed beyond reason, out of my head. There was plenty of time for self thought in the near future so I just cruised, listening to Third Eye. What a great song. It put me into another world full of art and Aztecan rituals. I was just another entity floating through space. My life has no reason. The universe is infinite yet always expanding. How does my small life hold any significance in such a large space? What am I doing? Why do I worry about grades and responsibility when my life really means nothing? Am I just following instinct? No, we are continuously suppressing our instincts with notions of law and science. This was a thought process I had and wrote down. It felt very important, but to a sober mind it sounds cold and ridiculous.
