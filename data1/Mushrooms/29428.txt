The others were talking in the kitchen and I could only understand the word she several times, to know they were talking about me but otherwise completely unable to understand what they were saying beyond the door. I worried that I would be trapped in that room forever, or until a predetermined time when I would move on to the other places. I desperately wanted to go home and see my cats. I wanted to see places in the world I hadnt been, not to be insane.
