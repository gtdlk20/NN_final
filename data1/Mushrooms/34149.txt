I was still completely conscious and everything, I was keeping track of the time and could still see and shit. But shit started to get even more intense.  The fat chick life guard who I work with came to get me off the stand for my thirty minute break and I had a really hard time climbing down the stand, but I managed it and said thanks to the fat girl, and started to walk towards the bath room.  Walking was hard.  Everything I did I knew it was off key, like I was walking weird, talking weird, looking at people weird.  I was almost to the bathroom so I could take a shower to get all the sweat off of me from being in the sun and this guy name John walked up to me who talks way too fucking much.  So I was like o great.
