Looking at his cousin Y, I saw nothing and felt nothing.  With her there was no golden aura or light shimmering, not even horns.  Just nothing.  I could not have been looking at her for more a few moments, although I suppose I could have been staring at her for an hour and not known it, when she said to me, in a voice that hinted fear, 'What are you looking at?'
