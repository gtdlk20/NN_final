That was my second time trying shrooms, my third time was 2 days after that day, were we did mexican ones in a park and everything was really funny, yet I was doing more thinking about god and how could such a mushroom do so much to your brain! As of having a bad experience the first time I decided to eat those ones really slow and at certain intervals of time. My second time wasn't as intense as the first time but it was definitely amazing.
