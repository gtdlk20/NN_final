I entered a state where my mind was running but I was unable to move my body or do anything but lay there in total confusion. I was trying to piece together what had happened that night and why I was in this fucked up state. I came up with a theory that mushrooms were the whole base of our existence and that one day everyone would realize that mushrooms were the answer to everything. I was really starting to sketch myself out and I assumed I would never be myself again, I would just be stuck in this mushrooms dimension of confused thought.
