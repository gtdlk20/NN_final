After an hour of watching the movie I finally got bored and decided to move on. Three hours into my trip, I had finally finished the tea, and the entire world seemed to be flipped inside out. All around me, everything looked different. The grass looked grey instead of green. The sky looked more like a hazy light blue-grey instead of blue. Everything seemed to have a new shade to it.
