Last night I tripped on *many* (~20) dried cubes. It was really an experience... or was it? The whole trip was marked by a common thought: 'this is no different from usual.' I had the distinct notion that tripping was in reality no different from normal thought; instead, I was just more focused on normal things. I was as in awe of the LACK of color enhancement as I've been at the INTENSITY of color enhancement from my first trip.
