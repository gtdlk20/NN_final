I saw the never-ending path of evolution that the essence traveled, and I saw each of us as its stepping stones. I saw that the path we had built was so broad that it would take an eternity to try to travel it. I envisioned the endless amount of possibilities and directions within the path and witnessed the trails that connected them to each other. Some of the paths I came across were old, and dark, while on the other hand, some of paths were freshly paved, and brightly lit. I had stepped outside the confinements of the earth and was seeing things from a worldly view.
