- Sensory overload. Visual hallucinations when eyes open and closed, auditory hallucinations, every sound exaggerated and reforming into another sound, extremely sensitive to touch. Ex. S touched me lightly on the back and I couldnÂ’t handle it, too overwhelming, fearful of touch because everything was already so much. Sense of space warped. Ex. Was trying to figure out for the longest time how close the stick beside me actually was and eventually gave up.
