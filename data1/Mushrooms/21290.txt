- I was talking to myself quite a bit, out loud. Small comments here and there about the water or the spider. I was conscious that I was talking to myself and might sound crazy to other people, but had a profound feeling of not caring about people seeing me this way, almost wanting them to so they could better understand people with mental disorders without judgements. I thought this is what going mad is probably like, and it wasnt bad at all, it was kind of fun, but then there was a deep sadness that if Id ever stayed like this in the real world Id have to say goodbye to everything that Ive known and all the people in my life because theres no way I would be able to interact with them anymore. I would probably live in the downtown East Side of Vancouver with others who experienced life like this, and at least there would be some sort of community that would understand, and that was okay. Eventually toward the end I started to accept that I might actually stay like this forever, and I felt so deeply bad for N who would be the only one able to take care of me at that point (he was the closest person in my life), and how sorry I was for putting this burden on him.
