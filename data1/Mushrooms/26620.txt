About a week from yesterday, my girlfriend had just finished another day at the local junior college from which we were driving to her house from.  We were both in a very good mood- she had just received a decent grade on an English 101 essay, and I had just scene a wonderful movie at my Film class, The Four Feathers.  Anyway, to give you a little history on the two of us- neither of us are so called heavy drug users, Ive dabbled into just about everything once or twice, but nothing in the way of addiction, and she has tried MDMA, LSD, Cocaine, and DXM, and uses Marijuana recreationally (just as I do).
