It was a beutiful sunday and a freind and I planned on tripping mushrooms. We split a rather large cap and took some where around 2 - 2.5 grams each. I chewed my mushrooms very finly and chased it down with a little bit of orange juice. We then smoked some pot to curb the naseua to ensure we tripped well. We walked down to a public park near by the river. We sat and smoked more pot to some Bob Marley. I had a bit of anxiety due to the excitement of consuming mushrooms for my first time. We sat there and waited for our trip to begin. I noticed that every once in a while I would breifly see strange spider webs that had a supernatural shine to them. But I wasnt sure if it was anything.
