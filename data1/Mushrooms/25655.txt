12:25 A.M. - This is the point where we began to notice our connectedness in our trips. It felt as if we were sharing the same senses and feelings and we both noticed the same exact visuals. Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I noticed an extremely short person who had just entered the room. I tried to look directly at him but he had disappeared. I told TRIP about what I had seen and he replied quite simply Yeah, dont worry, that was only James  We both looked at each other and began laughing uncontrollably at this for about 5 minutes straight. Neither of us knew where that comment or name had come from, but it just seemed right for some reason.
