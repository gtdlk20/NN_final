[Then my Mother begins to speak to me again, Me Lying on the Bed wonders if this is my mothers higher self, as she is still alive.]The relationship between me and my flesh and blood mother is deep and complicated. Nevertheless, her love for me is unconditional, and I view her unconditional love as a fractal of Gaias. I am truly honored that in this life I had a truly loving mother.
