3:15 - Starting to feel first signs of mushroom high. My group and I get up and decide to walk over to the free art museum in the park. Colors are distinctly brighter than normal. We walk through a clearing surrounded by a flowering tree in full bloom. The feeling of peace and beauty is indescribable. On our way there we leave Z sitting in a field. He has consumed the largest quantity of mushrooms and is feeling both nauseous and extremely high.
