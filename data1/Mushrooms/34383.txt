I was alone in my house for the night, it was 4:30, and my parents would come back around midnight. I ate half of the 4 grams with some orange juice and waited at my computer for them to kick in. I had no idea what awaited me. About 35 minutes later I felt I was becoming seperated from the world, similar to being semi-drunk without the loss of coordination. I started to look at some of my digital camera pictures on my PC. As I stared at them, one of the faces in the pictures moved like one of those images that change when you look at them from different angles. Soon, I started laughing at nothing, which was a similar to being stoned.
