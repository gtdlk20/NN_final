As far as I was concerned, drugs were a key part of the formula for me right from the start; it was all just a matter of time. I had always been curious about how various drugs affected the body, and even to this day I will spend hours reading countless drug reports. I cant say enough about my mother or ever give her the credit she deserves. Shes given me more than I can ever describe, but she was also very strict with my sister and I when we were growing up, and I cant help but feel as if she was slightly more strict with meor at least protective. I watched many of my friends and peers go through significant changes in their lives while I never felt like I really did much of anything outside of school.
