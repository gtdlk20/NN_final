About a half hour later I felt this intense body high and an appreciation for the sounds in the movie. The movie itself was uninteresting so we put on Pink Floyd's 'Wish You Were Here' to get us tripped out. Fifteen minutes later I was looking at the carpet and trying to figure out where the ends of the patterns were. I look up and see patterns all over M's face and R is under his covers looking around his room. I began to become very annoyed by M because I felt that he was the only sober one (obviously he wasn't) and I went under my covers and just looked around the room.
