We had explored the forest for a good 2 and a bit hours and had our fun discussing the meaning of things. My friend B saw two of our other friends on their way to the forest so he picked up 2 bottles and clanged them together to get there attention, The 2 bottles broke and me and him broke into a fit of laughter which did not stop till the trip was over.
