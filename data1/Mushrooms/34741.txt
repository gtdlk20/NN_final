First we go into the other bedroom, which is silent and pitch black. I realized that in the dark, it didnÂ’t matter whether my eyes were open or closed, either way I saw moving patterns, peace signs colored in rainbow running up the wall, blue springs floating in the air with the dust particles. We go back into the original room and I am ecstatic to find that it is still the same room behind the door, although it has taken on a completely different appearance. We ventured out the back slider, after concluding that glass was amazing because light and nothing else could get through it, and onto the patio.
