At this point in time Im still nervous as hell but Im slightly more settled due to the fact, that I thought I had rid myself and my girlfriend from any true legal threat.  I mean sure we had a lot of equipment, and it was obvious what it was for, but there wasnt any solid strands of evidence, like jars full of viable substrate (which I thought at the time would mean definite intent).
