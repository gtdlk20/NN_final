Upon returning, I showered in the outdoor shower.  This proved to be quite an ordeal, as I was hallucinating vividly. It was almost frightening, but enjoyable.  I went inside and talked to my housemate and a few other friends that had come to the house.  I found this to be the most intense part of my experience.  My hallucinations now included geometric patterns, and I could not distinguish shadows and rays of light very well.  The room seemed to be backlit, when in fact the lights were in front of me. Social interaction was trying.  I felt awkward, and my verbal skills (which I am flagrantly overusing now) were diminished.  I could not carry on a normal converstation or finish a train of thought.  Someone briefly turned on the television, and the lit screen didn't seem to be attached to its surroundings.  I was also sweating profusely, which added to my agitation.  An old chair in the room seemed to take on a life of its own, developing humanoid features.  I found this very comical, but kept it to myself as best I could, because I was already uptight.
