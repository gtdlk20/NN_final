On that night I said goodbye to the Mushroom. I promised I would return one day. I promised I would never forget what I had learned and I would carry it with me wherever I may go. I am a changed person, there is no doubt about that. My appearance hasnt changed. My personality hasnt changed. What has changed is how I perceive the world on a personal level. My place in the world is now clearly defined for me.
