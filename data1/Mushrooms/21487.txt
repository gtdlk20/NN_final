I was afraid that she might harm herself because we were high, and asked what she was doing. She mentioned she was cutting fruit and could handle it.  I felt my mind slipping into space-time possibilities: She might cut herself, she might flip out and cut me, I might try to take the knife from her and cut her, or I might try to take it away and get cut. I opted for the space-time choice where she realized she wasn't manipulating the knife very well because she was high. At that moment, she became a bit fumble fingered (which I pointed out), and she looked a litle panicked, and so I suggested she put the knife down and come to bed. She told me it suddenly had gotten hot, stripped off her clothes and came to bed. Language was much easier for me now, and I feel I was truly past 'peak experience' at this point.
