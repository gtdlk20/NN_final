I found that I finally know who I am, I've grown up, and I'm still growing. All I felt was that the quote 'all the worlds a stage, and all the men and women merely players' means everything. I found that in life, all I am is a breath of love, and I float through life trying to share the love I have for life with everthing and everyone I can. All I am is a fairy, and my only goal in life is to live it and give love. For about an hour I lay on the floor, smiling and twirling my hair. I felt like I'd grown old and been reborn, a little girl again, innocent. My life up till this year was spent trying to grow up, and I found that I'd done all of the growing up I needed and finally I am at peace with myself and my life. I've known this before, but it seemed so much more important.
