These ghosts around me made me a cup of tea and set out the guest bed and recommended I go to sleep. I followed their suggestions, thinking I might as well see where it takes me. I must have been exhausted, because I fell asleep quickly. Two hours later I woke up and it was midday, upon which I walked around a bit more, had a conversation with the (apparent ghost of) my friend's father, fixed his television for him, went upstairs to the computer and logged into my hosting company's server. Thought God's pretty clever to emulate TCP/IP and reassessed the situation from there.
