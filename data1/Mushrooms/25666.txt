1:30 A.M. - I had transported once again to the bed which I had started on. We watched Alice and cried uncontrollably at its beauty. We didnt really understand why we were crying, we just knew that it was beautiful and the whole movie was what life was supposed to be like. The smoking caterpillar in the movie befriended us. He seemed like an incredibly friendly character and it was as if he was trying to communicate with the both of us. TRIP named this caterpillar Eastfall (named changed). We looked to his poster where the same caterpillar was and we greeted Eastfall with enthusiasm.
