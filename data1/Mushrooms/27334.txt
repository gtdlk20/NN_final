The ritual begins at 2:45 AM. I have been waiting 5 years for this moment right now.  I first became interested in mushrooms when I read about their use by the Aztec Indians in Mexico.  I'm in my friend's garage that has been changed into a hang out room.  It has chairs, a CD player, couch, and a pool table.  I have two dried grams weighed out.  I love the taste of mushrooms.  To me they taste something like raw potatoes.  I'm with three friends, R, C, and D.  D is drunk on 14 beers, C, R's girlfriend is sober, and R has taken 1.5-dried grams.  We are taking Psilocybe Cubensis mushrooms.  I can tell because they are bruised blue where the person that had harvested them handled them.  The Doors are on. R recalls the time in our 11th grade English class, when I did a presentation on Jim MorrisonÂ’s poem Celebration of the Lizard King.
