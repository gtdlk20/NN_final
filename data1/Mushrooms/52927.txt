My body would keep twitching as i lay in bed i kept trying to do different things to try to relax me but none worked, i would turn on music but that would be too much for me and i couldn't handle it. Once i shut the music off, i kept hearing my close friends talking to me, but i couldn't see them it was very scary. Its been about three hours of hard core tripping and it really scared me i decided to smoke a bowl to relax me, but then i just started to peak. I went back to my room and laid down again saying 'its gonna be over in a few hours just wait it out you don't need to call 911.' My mind was completely shot, i think i may have even died for some minutes or something. what i remember is trying to concentrate on one thing and it just wouldn't happen. When i looked at something my mind could like not comprehend what i was seeing like my mind and body were in two different worlds and they wouldn't come together. For the rest of the night i sat there praying and staring at the clock until 2a.m. when i pretty much stopped tripping. All i have to say is stick to the normal 3-4 grams of shrooms this was the scariest experience of my life and i will never eat that much shrooms again, just be careful, thanks for reading this, your druggie friend
