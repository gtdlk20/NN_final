T + 3:30 The next cap and stem go down smooth. I saved a little bit of a cap for later though. We went back outside for another bowl before we ordered pizza. Then 20 minutes later we open the door to another person. Our wide-eyed tripped out outfits don't quiet understand what he's saying so we give him the money and grab the pizza. I figured out that of the 5 senses some can be manipulated easier than others. Smell, taste, sound, touch, then sight. Meditation can help with the ability to change these. When listening to the crickets and frogs outside it doesn't have the normal sound it usually does. It made music and sounds I don't usually hear.
