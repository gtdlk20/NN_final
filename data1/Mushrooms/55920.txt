So my buddy N started to feel like he wanted to go outside for a smoke, either he was claustrophobic in the small place or it was too smokey in there, and we had a little conversation on whether or not we should go outside, but to me it felt like it lasted an eternity, and after what seemed like a while (but wasn't that long), the idea of being inside and being outside started to seem really really trippy to me for some reason (well shrooms). So when we went outside, there was this security dude walkin around, and we were talkin about how fucked we were, and for some reason that made me paranoid at the time and it didn't occur to me that hey it's new year's, of course we're fucked up, the security won't care. Then the security guy came and talked to N, and I couldn't understand what the hell anyone was sayin (the old 'bluhbumehengrenereh' sound that replaces people's words sometimes), so I got kinda worried we'd get searched. But it was all good. But that started makin the trip go downhill for me.
