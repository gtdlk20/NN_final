0:40: I stopped talking, no longer being able to find words to describe anything. This is very common for me on hallucinogens, I can't find anything worth saying so I say nothing. It beats babbling like an idiot. I stood up and walked inside, this is when I realised just how high I had become. Walking about five metres to my house's door was difficult. Lines of reference and perspective seemed warped, i.e. looking at the door it appeared as if the top of the frame was coming towards me and the bottom of the door was far further away. I stumbled inside. A few friends followed me in. I lay down on a couch and stared at a ceiling. My friends were all talking about how 'fucked up' they were and trying to describe it which is really boring: 'Dude it's like my mind and my body are in a cosmos of yadah yadah yadah'
