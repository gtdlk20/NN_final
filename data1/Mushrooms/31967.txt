The slow phlegmatic movement of my observable world brought about a disconcerting sensation. I looked towards the white clock in the corner of the room and thought to myself, my god I have at least 4 more hours of this. Right then and there the long arduous days of research, the late nights listening to Terence McKenna and all the personal experiences I read came roaring into my consciousness. I realized I had two choices, either I let whatever the hell is happening to me take over, or, I fight it and run the risk of a creating a disastrous trip.  I took a couple deep breaths and let it all go. I took a couple deep breaths and let it all go.
