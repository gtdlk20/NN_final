It all started really nicely and everything was pleasant. I got the feeling that I was in a very deep state of meditation, like my normal sessions but on steroids (or I guess mushrooms in this case). I started feeling a warm sort of tingling, or buzzing sensation spreading up my back and to the rest of my body. As I sat there, staring at a picture of Padmasambhava I have tacked up on the wall, the wall I was staring at began to morph a bit, and the picture of Padmasambhava also began to morph around. This phenomenon distracted me a very great deal but I continued to concentrate on the picture. As it moved thoughts started floating around in my head. Subtle suggestions that became traps I set for myself. I had a thought about the moving picture turning from a picture of peace to one of menace and sure enough the picture took on a very demonic look to it. The light from a nearby candle reflected ruby red in the eyes of the picture and the look on his face took on an evil grimace. I realized right away that this was just my mind playing tricks but it started giving me the spooks none the less.
