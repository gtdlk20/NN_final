We laid in bed face to face, and she asked me if I was ready to sleep. I said 'Soon', and let her drift off to sleep. I listened to her snore for a long time, and she occasionally woke up with a panicked start saying things like 'I forgot you were here'.  Approximately 6am, I was ready for sleep, turned my back, and eventually sleep came.  She woke up once during this time, and I recall telling her 'go back to sleep.'
