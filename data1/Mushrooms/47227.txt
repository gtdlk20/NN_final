My focus on the leaf was interrupted by a vision of what appeared to be an angel in the upper right of my visual field. This angel was drawn in the style on the medieval artists, leading me to the thought that perhaps the artists of that time were not just bad at drawing, but had actually seen the same thing as me and were merely recording their trip and contact with what they believed to be angels. This angel slowly morphed into two and they turned onto their sides and became 3 dimensional cut outs, these began gyrating back and forth.
