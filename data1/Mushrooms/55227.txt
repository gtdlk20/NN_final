I was overcome with sadness and the realization that this was a memory, and that I had seen this same fire, this same flame reflected in a copper fire ring, in another time.  I was watching it through different eyes, but the same because they had once been different windows to my soul. I watched the fire but did not feel comfort from its warmth, the reflection of the heat and light told me a story of when this had been a necessity, when I had been a slave to someone cruel, that I felt hopeless, with no future, no expectation of freedom or change.  I knew I would die, I knew this fire was someone elseÂ’s fire, that I had seen that reflection in burnished copper in another time, an ancient time.  A time when I had been a woman, and I had been property and not prized property, and the flames and the copper brought up a deep sadness and despair.  I acknowledged this memory, this feeling and I let it go, back to the stars, back to the fire and out of my memory.
