My friend and I started talking, and I just was trying to explain a simple metaphor about the moon. I said you don't choose to see the moon, the moon chooses to see you, like if you go outside and its cloudy you can't see it, if its clear outside then you can see it. He started saying a bunch of stuff about what about science, and telescopes, and how the light bounces off the clouds. Completely unable to grasp the concept of I meant when you walk outside as an individual on a day to day basis. Then all of sudden he started teasing me and acting weird. He was failing to understand basic concepts. He was asking me questions that he should of been determining for himself. He couldn't perceive the present moment, he kept talking about the future.
