I have used LSD a hundred times since 1989, with an 8 year period away from it in my late 20's/early 30's.  I have smoked cannabis daily through an odd array of 2-3 year jobs, including law enforcement, teaching, residential treatment centers, disc jockeying, steel mills, sales, restaurants and bar tending.  I have primarily been a musician though and I have been drinking since I could walk.  I have consumed entire half gallons of vodka.  I even tried shrooms finally when I was almost forty, twice I did maybe 2g's and got little to nothing from it.
