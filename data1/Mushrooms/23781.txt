I apologize for the lack of clear explanations of my trip, but this is beyond words.  There are no words that will ever do justice to a mushroom experience, at least that is my opinion.  No two trips I have had were ever the same, or even remotely similar.  That is why they never get boring to me.  I am always anxious to see what the next bag of fungus has in store for me.  I dont mean to put a drug up on a pedestal, but in my opinion it is one of the safer drugs to do.  For now, I would have to say shrooms are my drug of choice.
