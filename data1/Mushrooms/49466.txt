So there we were, in our apartment, safe, comfortable, and with a designated baby sitter for us.  It was around 11pm when we took the shrooms, chewing them up real good and letting them dissolve.  We then decided to watch the Sopranos just to pass the time and wait for the inevitable to come.  After about 30 minutes I started noticing in my peripheral visions that glow and somewhat growing of the surroundings.  But when looking at them directly it returned to normal.  About 15 minutes later is when it all started to kick in real good.  Our apartment was well equipped for our journey.  Having 3 computers in our living room, all having some type of trippy screen saver or desktop running on them.  It was a feast for the eyes.
