Flickers of light crossed my vision.  Colours changed without notice.  Think of an old television set that flickers from black and white to colour and back again, except it wasn't that simple.  Things flickered from 'negative' to 'psychadelic' to 'pastel' etc etc.  The sounds started to warp, echoes began occuring with too much frequency, much more than the normal 12 mushroom trip.  Echoes occured not only after sounds, but before as well.  Sometimes pre-echoes would build up and up, but then no sound came.  I felt wet and clammy, like I was melting all over.  My hair had a feeling of static.  Overall, physical sensation was bizarre.
