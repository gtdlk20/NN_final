T + 6:00 I decided it was time to eat the last cap for a little boost in the trip. Unfortunately it was a little over the edge making me feel kind of sick but it didn't give me a bad trip and I just stuck out the times when my stomach felt sick and enjoyed the rest. I went to the mirror and tried to go through it, although I couldn't get it to become watery and let me go into it, the mirror did suck in my hand and deform itÂ…very cool.
