Minutes past and we decided to go to my friends house where we would end up staying the night, and we got in the car the outside world was nothing I recognized.  Reaching my friends house the shrooms begin to hit me hard. I was now seeing colorful patterns everywhere and the walls were beating like a heart.  I stared in amazement.  I felt so happy, everthing was great and so colorful.  The room was decorated in black lights and fake cob weebs we saved from Halloween.
