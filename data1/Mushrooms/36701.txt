We tried to go outside for a walk and smoke some, but I got too cold and had to go in; something about the cold and the outside world was so frightening, I was even talking to my friend and suddenly realized he was scaring the shit out of me, I panicked as I looked at his eyes (wide with surprise) and had to run away, I felt other entities zooming around taunting and laughing at me and asking why I was so scared.  Parts of this trip were really terrifying, I knew I was losing my mind when I could hear and feel very distinctive beings around me; it was like being a schizo really.
