I do recall thinking that I had to teach myself to experience time in a cause-and-effect way again if I was going to come back to normal space.  So I began taking snippets of sounds that I'd heard previously, and putting them together in my head in sequential order. This was a long, drawn out trial-and-error process. But eventually I came back to myself in normal time.
