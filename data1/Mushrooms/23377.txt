I looked at my hand while it was morphing. While observing it, I noticed a red spot on my hand that almost looked like a blood clot that wasn't there before I started tripping. I asked my friend if it was actually there, he said 'yes.' This freaked me out. Suddenly, everything started to go haywire in my mind. All of my tranquil thoughts were disrupted. To make things worse, another one appeared 5 minutes later. My trip turned very bad very fast. The thought of death in such a beautiful state of mind was overwhelming.
