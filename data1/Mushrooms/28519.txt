The drive home was just awesome! I loved the driving rules and how everybody obeyed them (or the majority). It was like they were giving me a smooth, discrete guidance back to society. I drove (honestly: sober) and felt like I was being greeted by the traffic signs and the arrows and lines painted on the tarmac. Almost enjoying how the other cars overtook me and set the blinker to get back in the lane in front of me.
