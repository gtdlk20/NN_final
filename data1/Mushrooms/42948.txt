A battle raged on in my head for weeks as I tried to decide who I should take the drugs with, if I should even take them at all. I refused to be tempted to ingest this powerful psychoactive substance until I knew in my soul the time was right. I was unsure when that would be, but felt like when the time came, I would simply know. Fortunately, I had found while doing my research that dried mushrooms stayed edible for years, provided you keep them out of the light, heat and moisture. While researching the drug, I managed to find several reports from people who had admitted to have taken it alone the first time, and I was still even considering that option myself. I would indeed have to be strong minded to succeed in such a feat.
