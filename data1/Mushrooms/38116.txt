At this point the giggling subsides. We watch Simpsons after Simpsons and zone out to pleasant music. Everything seems warped and bloated. Stalin's ceiling bulges and swims like a thing alive. At this point I start to lose touch with reality. I see dripping blood everywhere at about 7 pm and I love it. At this point visuals are very intense. Both comrades are seeing streamers and the like. Stalin and I decide to go smoke a cigarette. Lenin remains in bed in a pleasant delirium. As we walk down the flights of stairs the dorm room becomes a sort of Aztec temple complete with crazy friezes, wall motifs, and a sense of mystery. I have a cigarette in hand but absolutely no idea what to do with the damn thing. To me every little human action is absurd. I have no idea what this piece of fabric they call a coat is. I have no idea how this piece of fabric is draped on my left shoulder and around my left arm. I have no idea where to go from here. Is this how a normal person wears a coat? How do I get this damn thing on? It all seems so absurd. So it went that night.
