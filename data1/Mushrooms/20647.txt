Normally, we either take such a statement for granted or dismiss it entirely. In our world of post-modern reduction, of course I am the universe. My experiences make my subjective reality, and so for all intents and purposes I am the maker of my own universe. But this is not what the entity meant. As it continued to playfully (but mercilessly) poke my face and repeat its mantra, it showed me things I could have never dreamed of seeing and that I will most likely never see again.  I cannot remember what these scenes looked like, probably for the better, but I finally understood how everything is alive, infinitely connected, and incomprehensibly hilarious and beautiful.  And then I realized, everything emanates from everything else. Everything is one, on every scale imaginable, and every single thing is a cocreator in the project of being. ItÂ’s truly a shame how easy it is to lose sight of these things while in the state of everyday, baseline consciousness. Either way, once I realized these things, my cosmic Watcher and Knower ended its dance and rather unceremoniously revealed itself.
