I turned around at the end of the road and headed back home.  After a minute, I took my shoes off and walked barefoot.  After another minute, what the hell, I took my clothes off and walked naked for a half mile or so, while constantly checking behind me for approaching cars.  It felt good to walk naked; I was cold when I began my walk but now I felt very comfortable.
