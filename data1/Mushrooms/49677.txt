I didnÂ’t want to be around people on other drugs. The people on E were too edgy and fast and the people smoking pot just felt too slow and stupid. I felt when I was tripping that I was finding areas of my head that had been dulled by pot and it annoyed me. I tried to smoke when I was on the trip but found it horrible. If I had remained in that frame of mind I never would have smoked pot again.
