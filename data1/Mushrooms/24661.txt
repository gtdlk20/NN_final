So as we journeyed down for what must have been a thousand years, I often had to grab J's arm and pull him along to keep us moving.  I tried to make small talk and light conversation with B, but to no avail.  Eventually, we rounded a corner and came face to face with an older couple, walking their dogs.  I thought about the the helicopters immediately.  Before the couple was in hearing range, I whispered to my friends to pull it together now, and just keep walking.  We did, I stopped and said something nice to one of the dogs, but kept walking.  B says that the man said 'be careful' as he walked away.
