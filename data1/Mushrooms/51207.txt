Around 7 o'clock, I dropped my 'shrooms, and started to welcome people into my house. The fun was about to begin. Once about 10 people had arrived, someone suggested that we hotbox my sauna, which we had done before, on numerous occasions. So, I cranked the sauna up, and we all sat around for an hour, waiting for it to heat up. During this hour, I downed half a 26er of Absolut Mandarin, and began to slowly drink down my 40 of Bull Max (much better than Colt).  Once the sauna was nice and hot, and I was nice and buzzed, we all headed downstairs and prepared our pipes and bongs for a night of heavy use.
