I had ordered a week before some magic truffles on the Internet. The specie is called 'Psilocybe pajateros' . I had ordered 6 grams of dried truffles. It was apparently equivalent to 15 grams of fresh stuff. Taking the whole thing would be a strong trip according the the seller. I decided to eat all the truffles at once, I have tried in different occasions to take half of a dose and then redose, but it has always been disappointing, lasting the comedown instead of increasing the edge of the experience.
