On a cold, sunny, December morning in 2013 while alone in my cabin on the shore. I slowly chewed approximately 4 grams of dried psilocybin cubensis. Within 15 minutes I felt a surge of mental energy and set about cleaning up, putting things in order, and banking the fire in the woodstove. It was 19 degrees outside; if I went for a hike on the island I wanted to come home to a tidy house and a warm fire.
