I had just recently bought a bag of Psilocybe cubensis shrooms (4 grams or a little over 1/8ths oz. total proved by two different scales) from a friend not 4 weeks ago. The shrooms are definitely cubensis strain, and a very light blue adorns certain parts of the mushrooms. This to me indicates oxidation of the psilocin, I first got them fresh (day old and dried) and did not see this.
