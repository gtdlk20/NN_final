I figured a night to myself was in order. I basically just want to write this down for my own personal memory since its still fresh and one of the most enjoyable mushroom trips IÂ’ve ever had. Now that I think about it I have never really done mushrooms on my own until last night. I have done acid alone on a couple of occasions when I was younger, but not in as calm and secure place as my own home. I had parents to worry about at the time. Could you imagine talking to your mom tripping out on 3 hits of acid?! Lol could anything possibly be more anxiety ridden and insane?
