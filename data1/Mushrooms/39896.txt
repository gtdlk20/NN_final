I think the oldest girl was in front on her own bike and the middle girl rode another bike with the youngest sitting on a back seat, her legs dangling off to the side. The youngest carried a vibrant flower. They looked like one chain of angels to me, riding away single file like they did. As they rode away, the youngest girl on the back of one of the bikes looked back in my direction and I saw a large eye in the middle of her forehead, her third eye, the energy eye. She was a divine entity; a pure, unadulterated messenger of life, a vessel for energy. And she carried a flower. I felt touched by divinity. I felt confirmation of a force of nature I had only vaguely defined before. I felt blessed by her.
