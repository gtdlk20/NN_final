After some time (how long I don't remember) I started to feel the effects. I first knew that I was feeling it when I went to light a cigarette. I had the cigarette in my mouth and I cupped my hands around (to protect the flame from the wind). When I attempted to light the cigarette I couldn't figure out how far away the flame was from the cigarette. My hands turned into a tunnel, and everything seemed far away. After several minutes I finally lit my cigarette. A few drags in, I broke the cigarette in half, unaware of how hard I was holding it. After another 2 cigarettes broke, I gave up. I decided to go into my friends computer room and just relax for a little while. This is when things got crazy. I looked at the computer screen and saw a picture I had made with MSPaint. I took a picture of a trippy looking mushroom I found online and used bright colors to fill it in. The mushroom was moving back and forth. This was a good experience, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Then my attention turned towards some pictures on the wall. 3 clowns. Yes... clowns. Each clown was in a different position, but they were all moving. The center one looked at me, waved, and winked. At this time I bugged out. I kept repeating, 'The clowns... the clowns!!! THEY ARE SO FREAKY!!! GET THEM AWAY!!!' Although I was freaked out, I found them very fascinating.
