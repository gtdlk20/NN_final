I stopped at the main drum circle and danced and watched the pattern change and watched people just let out the most intense energy through the windows of psychedelics. I saw people with their eyes closed and their mouths half open shaking their heads horizontally, seizure style, and creating the most amazing drum beat. It was just weird. but my curiosity got the best of me, so I went in search of the 'better one.' It's about a block away, I walked there the next day sober, but I swear to god it took me at least half an hour to get there, in a straight line with a straight pace. The dark looked darker than ever and at the same time, my vision was perfected. Peripheral imaginary movement consumed everything as I strolled on. I felt smart, whole, like I was on my way to an important ritual on behalf of my family tribe. Though I don't have a family tribe. hehe.
