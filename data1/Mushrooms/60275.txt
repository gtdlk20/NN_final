The colors of life, the sky, the way the music sounded - '...this message is coming to you. . .', I thought it was coming to ME.  My sense seemed to be heightened about 1000 times normal and everything had a slant of humor or happiness.  The boat. . Wow!!!  The sky, moon, air and water were all equally as warm to my senses as my own heart. As in the truck, everything seemed to be a new environment, a new place that I was very comfortable in/with, but experiencing for the first time.
