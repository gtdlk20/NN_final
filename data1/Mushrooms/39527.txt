Another noteworthy thing was that I grieved for my mother who passed on 7 years ago, and it was the most serene grief that I've ever experienced.  I understood that death was simply a natural part of life and that it will eventually come to us all and that my mom had completed her 'journey' so to speak, and it put me at peace.  In the 2 months since my mushroom experience, I've dealt with the grief of my mother's death more than I did in the previous seven years.
