That mushroom trip was the best experience of my life.  I must have built up tolerances to mushrooms, because we tried again two more times in that month but I never felt anything even close to that powerful night.  Never in my life have I felt another psychic and spiritual connection with other people like what we felt that night.  Next time I want to eat an eighth and see what happens.  I think if everybody could handle a mushroom trip and tried it, the world would be a better place.
