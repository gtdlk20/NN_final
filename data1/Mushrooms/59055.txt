Casey was smoking a cigarette by a light, with much intrigue I watched him inhale and exhale the smoke. He turned and noticed me looking at him funny, so he tried to bug me out (again)...he asked me what color the smoke was and what it looked like. I replied by telling him the smoke looked dense and brown instead of white and fluffy. I noticed there was a hint of green in the smoke. He told me that I was seeing what the smoked really looked like and that all the colors were tar and chemicals. I was grossed out at the fact that I could see the tar in the smoke, yet it was laughing so hard.
