So I made it to the park and walked at least one circle around the playground before I realized what I was doing. I was absolutely freezing at this point and Remember the Time had come on. I decided to cut across the 'wilderness'  between the park and my neighborhood in an effort to get to my car quicker. And I repeated to myself, do you remember when you used to run? Do you remember when you'd spend your nights out in the cold without a shirt running till your lungs burned and your legs yowled in pain? Those moments were quintessentially defining for me. Through running, I gained a chance to be alone with my pain and the core of who I was, free from the influences of friends, love interests, or family. I'd get to picture myself in my mind as I wanted to be and not who I needed to be to get others to like me. Running myself into exhaustion was a process that brought me into touch with a part of Zubair that I usually relegate to the nether regions of my mind. It brings out the Zubair that is quiet, reserved and carries a silent pain with him wherever he goes. A somber Zubair who wonders about life, hopes for love and feels the pain of missed chances.
