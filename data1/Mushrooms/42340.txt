Then, I remember M coming into my room and talking to me, I couldnt see him, but I knew he was there.  I remember him asking me if I was becoming one with everything, and all I could think was, if only you knew.  After about two and a half hours of this, I came out of this amazing state.  My friends all flooded into my room, with the lights off, and we just had a great time.  The energy in there was amazing.  But, something strange that happened was that I couldnt see anyones face.  I saw everyone with fiery auras.  It was kind of like in Starcraft, the dark archons.  It wasnt threatening or anything of the sort, just kind of strange.
