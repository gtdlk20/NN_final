With these feelings of love and happiness came a strong spiritual sense.  I was never a very religious person but this night I felt as if I understood everything about life, death, and God.  I realized that the time we have on Earth is nothing and our lives will be over just as quickly as they begun.  However, I was perfectly content with the fact that I too will die.  I felt as if I knew what was going to happen to me after I die even though I really had no idea.  I thought of Heaven and Hell and could actually feel their presence above and beneath me.  I understood how the universe came into existence but I could not explain how I knew.  I recognized the beauty of Earth and I realized what I had to do to get the most out of life.
