The first sign came at 9 on the dot when the tv began to subtly ripple.  The coming up, for me, is really all about anticipation and until 45 minutes or so I am fairly normal.  I have yet to puke but I always feel like I'm pretty darn close at about this point.  For the next hour we watched Elf and enjoyed the limited, and often overstated, visual hallucinations.  I have never found the visuals to be the highlight of a trip as the media would have outsiders believe.  And by outsider, I mean those who have never ventured into the shroom world.
