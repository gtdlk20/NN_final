I went into this trip, wanting to get more insight into a good way to live my life, which is focused on activism to help the Earth and itÂ’s inhabitants who are currently suffering. On my previous 3 trips, I learned so much about myself, western culture/consumerism, and my connection to the land, other people, and other species. On all three, my friends and I ventured around wooded areas during the height and then while coming down, local shops and residential areas. For this trip, I wanted to take a higher dosage, and mainly attempt to keep my eyes shut and ponder in a meditative state (still in out in a natural setting).
