As I returned to the room once again I now noticed that the breathing had stopped for the moment. Again I began giggling uncontrollably to the point where I actually had to cover my mouth with my own hands to keep me from just screaming in laughter. I again sat myself at my computer and talked to a few people online. I looked at the clock and it was 945 now. I was on my way to the other room to use the 3rd phone line as to not wake my mom. On the way to the room I was stopped by my wall mirror. I looked in it as if it was a portal. And at this point in time for me it was. I discovered right then and there that it is 100x easier to talk to myself when I can see myself talking back. I stood in front of my mirror (sat rather) and talked to myself for a good 20 mins. In this 20 mins I discussed where I was heading in life and how I should handle some issues at hand. Its amazing what the mushrooms unlocked in my head. It was like having a conversation with my brain but being able to use my reflection as a person to talk to. This was truely a spiritual situation. I finally wrapped up this convo and told myself that from now on whenever a huge issue comes up I would go to this mirror and very hard think things over before comitting to something. After all was said and done it was 1015.
