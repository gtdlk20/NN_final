When I was done with the cake I felt a little different, clearer, but I couldn't conclude if it was the mushrooms or just the anxiety factor. At this time, I started taking pictures of everything - myself, the left-over shrooms, my carpet... and I began drawing on my body (flowers, sun, etc) and changed into very psychedelic clothing - simply because I love looking like I'm tripping while I am. This was only the beginning of a series of body art and clothing changes, not to mention pictures. However, since it had been roughly 45 minutes and I wasn't feeling very much, and I knew the dose I took was relatively low, I decided to eat some more. However, this time I just picked up a handful and swallowed them with some o.j. I tasted them but it wasn't too bad.
