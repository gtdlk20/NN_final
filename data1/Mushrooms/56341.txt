The night started on a wafting boom. My cousin had previously bought the shrooms and we were both excited about taking them, since this was the first time for both of us. My cousin hadn't even tried marijuana before, let alone a psychedelic drug. I admire her courage. Though she said it wasn't courage, just curiosity and shrooms are easier to take in public.
