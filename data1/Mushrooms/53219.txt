POST-TRIP FEELINGS: I have experienced a regression back to adolescence on an emotional level [Oh no, not again!]. My feelings have ranged from depression to elation, initially with a period of about half a day of each. I have also noticed unusual responsiveness to different hormonal levels, and have occasionally responded to music with unexpected vigor. Fortunately, after a couple of weeks and a few teen-like stunts, I seem to have become my normal (?) self again.
