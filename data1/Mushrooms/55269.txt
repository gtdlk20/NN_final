As we were walking, the walls were making faces and I felt like I was in an absolutely wicked and interesting state of mind and felt that the world was just bright and beautiful. As we reached our room I started to feel really mashed so I thought we'd go and lie on our beds for a while, as I opened the door of our room, every single thing seemed to be moving in the room, it was hilarious! The lamp was just dancing and the pillows were all dotted and light in the room was so bright, A started repeating the word 'shrooms' the whole time and just laughing! He kept on telling me on how this is so fucking good! We were laughing our asses off for I dont know how long (It took us quite some time to figure the time).
