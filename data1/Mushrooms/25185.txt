As I held this note, I shut my eyes and had visualisations of stripes of blues and reds in wave-like formations, each with a row of little balls slowly moving along from right to left. The balls alternated with various words, none of which I can recall. When this became too heady, I opened my eyes to find my hand resting on random groups of keys, which gave me more interesting and dischordant notes. These sounded so organic that I felt I was inside the music. As a musician I would usually avoid dischords, but these didn't bother me, even though I was holding down five consecutive keys.
