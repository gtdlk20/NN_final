This is also why I approach the psychedelic experience from a full spectrum of explorations, including scientific, chemical, psychological, mythical, mystical, psychic and spiritual angles.  Yes, the molecules do their thing but the psychology and the personal mythical narrative is how we experience those chemicals.  We are spiritual beings looking for meaning in and through experiences and the analytical science alone is not enough to fulfil our deep internal desire for mythical underpinning to our physical experiences.
