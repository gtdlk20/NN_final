I almost stopped to consider the implications of what my desire to be like Michael Jackson entailed, but then the song ended and Who Is It began to play. At this point, the trip took a turn for the worse. I knew it would, but I reminded myself that if Michael could get through these feelings, I could too. I immediately began to think of Justina as the song started playing, but the lyrics don't correlate exactly. In the song, the girl promises they'll live forever as one. I never got such a promise from her. I almost stopped the song because I was frustrated that it wasn't addressing my scenario specifically and that was what I so desperately wanted right then - someone to examine and distill the details of my relationship with Justina for me.
