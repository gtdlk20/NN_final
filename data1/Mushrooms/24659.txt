We determined that we were lost, but B insisted he knew where we were, and since he was the most familiar with the area, we lined up behind him and placed massive pressure on the poor boy.  I knew we were all lost, including B, but there was really only one way to go, and we were just being paranoid, so we should just lighten up and keep walking.  So B is leading us, he doesn't say much, he looks very serious and sad, and ocassionaly he dodges an invisible tree branch, or stops to regain his balance, or simply to stand there with his mouth open, seeing things that I never even asked about.  J is behind me and he stops repeatedly, often screaming very loudly and stating that 'they were climbing up his socks'.  I think he had some pebbles in the fibers of his socks.  He spits, sees the discoloration from the orange soda, and tells us that its blood, and also that the Yeti is behind him.
