From my research, Sclerotia are roughly 70% water by weight while mushrooms are around 90% water. Dry sclerotia are 2/3 as potent as dry cubensis fruits, while fresh sclerotia are twice as potent as fresh cubensis. This is due to the fact that sclerotia contain 3 times more dry matter per quantity of fresh material.
