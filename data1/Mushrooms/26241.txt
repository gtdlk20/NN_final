Upon the return to my room, the anxiety continued to build. I tried putting on different music--didn't help. I had no idea what to do, but I knew I wanted it all to stop, to end, to just fade away. There was no solution though, except to crawl into my mom's arms, crying, pleading for forgiveness and asking the heavens why I took mushrooms. I almost got up to do this when my racing mind came to a halt.
