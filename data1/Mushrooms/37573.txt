The trip was an incredible experience. Even when the police had harassed us, I felt very little paranoia, and was completely comfortable with myself and my surroundings. Although I have not tripped since this experience (due to time/money/school/etc), I wish to do it again in daylight, for the visual patterns were only apparent when I went inside in the light and the only time i got to to see brilliant colors was when the cops stopped us. I hope this report is useful to others.
