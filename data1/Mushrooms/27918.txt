This time the mushrooms were there. I immediately sensed their presence, and was filled with their omnipresent love and warmth. They were happy and goofy and being with them made me giggle. They tried to show me jokes- my mother-in-law's existence, for example, was shown to me as the product of some kind of Cosmic Silliness. I told them that my husband was planning on tripping soon, and they replied that they looked forward to seeing him, but they seemed to find that hilarious too. They also told me that I should apply for a certain job, and gave me the idea that my working there would be highly amusing to them. I didn't quite get the jokes, but I giggled anyways (it was impossible not to). I asked the entities why they had pushed me away earlier and they said, 'You needed to think about that stuff by yourself.' I came out of this last trance at about 11:45 chuckling and full of love and happiness.
