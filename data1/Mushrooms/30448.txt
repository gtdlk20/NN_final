We talked about all the people in the world, and how so many of them live their life each day separately, and well never know or meet most of them.  Yet they keep living in their own world.  And we were sad that we cant just go up and talk to anyone.  And we were sad because so many people seemed so great and so nice, we felt like we were missing out.  This travesty dawned on us for a bit as we went on about existence.  Then we eventually just layed down and enjoyed looking up at the rain of color (leaves).  We took the yellow bouncy ball and threw it up into the sky and as it distanced from our hands it blended in each time with the assortment of the yellow until it came back down.  It seemed like it was all moving in slow motion.
