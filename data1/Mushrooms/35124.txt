So after watching all this unfold in front of me for about an hour, it began to drift away and soon the fan was making it's normal noise. I sat up in bed since I hadn't moved one muscle since it began, and had the urge to talk. What happened was utterly insane. I said 'Jing Jong Parvey' and began to speak but I was not talking in words. It was just a jumbled mess of letters and all the different sounds that my human voice could make. Not only that, but I was flailing my arms and legs about. It was like I was going complete nuts. But it was fun.
