Halfway home we pulled up to a Pizza Hut.  At this point we were all realizing how incredibly strange everything was... There was no longer a sense of 'gee everything is so pretty,' rather sub-lingual communication between the four of us was getting constrewed (in other words, we were peaking for sure).  The waitress (a waitress at Pizza Hut??) must've thought us to be absolutely insane because we could barely manage a sentence, plus our pupils must've been incredibly dialated.  Besides freaking the waitress out, the Pizza Hut experience was very metaphysical.  One of my companions finally managed to spurt out a well-articulated order with specific instructions on how to cook the crusts w/ cheese... He really suprised me.
