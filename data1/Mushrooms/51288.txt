The intensity seemed to come in waves. By this time the physical sensations were very strong and I was feeling a little uneasy. I was ready to come back down. I could tell the physical effects were starting to be a little less intense but the mind-expanding effects were still in full effect. The screen was still moving and letters would change shape and it was hard to read words. I wanted to pull up a program out of My Documents and the since of me seemed so selfish I did not even want to have a My Documents folder on my computer. I also realized that synthetic drugs as well as alcohol if used to get drunk was a form of senseless self-indulgence. I then laid down on my bed and closed my eyes ready to take another journey into the mind.
