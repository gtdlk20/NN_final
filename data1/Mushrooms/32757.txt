After only about 15 mins I felt the effects kick in. The room got lighter. I was sitting on the floor with my back to the sofa and noticed that Neils side of the room was yellow due to a yellow lampshade that he was sitting next to and my side of the room was red due to a red lampshade near me. The table in front of me started morphing and became elongated. The speed of which these effects came on startled me slightly. I remember we went into my garden and I was feeling pretty much as shroomed as I had ever been before but knew things were gunna get a lot wilder. I had the distinct feeling of being on a roller coaster that was making its way up the hill and could sense that it still was only a few measly feet from the ground with a long way to go. We went inside. Neil wasnt feeling the effects yet. I remember him saying these mushrooms are really mellow and I nodded my head in agreement as it seemed the path of least resistance and least concentration needed. All my concentration was now focused on the man in my head telling me Dan your fucked mate.
