Arriving home just after dusk, we exited the car and walked over to the barn in our yard. No need to go inside the house and face the 'rents. I had begun closing my eyes and saw distinct trails of colour. I would open my eyes and see the faint image of those trails in the dark surroundings. At this point I decided to call a good friend of mine with my cell phone. He had tripped for the first time on shrooms the weekend previous and we discussed the effects.
