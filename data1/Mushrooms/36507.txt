As we walked I explained to Wayne that we all have numerous lives each one a mask of who we really are to impress others. How we act with our parents, our teachers and girls. I told him that concrete is evil because it covers life and blankets the world with death. Throughout the night I ranted and babbled about things I didnt think I thought about. I talked to everyone I seen and ended up at a patch of grass. In fact the first patch we had seen on our journey. I pointed to it and said Look, look at the energy, its aura. That my friend is life. I stood there and told my two companions we should sit here for a while.
