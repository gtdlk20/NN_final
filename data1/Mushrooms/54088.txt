After some time passes I decide that I gota make the best out of the rest of my trip and talk Akmed into just going with me out side to chill with me while I smoke a bong load by my pool. This was a very good idea cause when I finished my bong I was trippin balls again and was just spacin out on the sky and Akmeds trip came back and was happy again.It was so beautiful, the sky seemed to turn into a crazy futeristic tunnel that as I staired it took me through it.Then wejust chilled in my room the rest of the night till dawn. Akmed also wrote down what he said would be a hit song someday on a piece of paper then we all passed out.
