It was a humid summer evening and I could see the last few rays of the sun shimmering off the light mist near the forest. We walked through the fog and into the forest, noting our oneness with nature, and writing down everything that came to us, much of which dealt with pirates. D began furiously hammering out nonsense ramblings in his notebook and the most fucked up part about the forest was that when we came out on the other side, it was suddenly dark. We sat on the damp grass and contemplated such things as war, poverty, and what to do with our lives. We then wandered the streets like the mind-fucked little weirdos we were, pausing to investigate shiny things such as mailboxes or street lights.
