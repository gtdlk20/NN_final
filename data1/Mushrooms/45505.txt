Sometime after this I started to get more and more confused until the point that I had no idea who I was or what anything was. I remember I kept reciting the names of my 2 friends, the name of the dealer we had purchased the mushrooms from and the word 'mushrooms'   over and over again I repeated these words in my head. I was stuck in a thought loop of total confusion. After I realized I couldn't figure it out and the thought loop finally stopped I remember I kept on thinking 'fuck it'. I was no longer going to worry about what was happening I was just going to lay there and let it happen. I finally came out of this crazy mushroom trance and woke up at about 4:30. I was still very high and i tried to put some clothes on. I found the most random clothes around my room and put them all on totally wrong. I tried to log onto my computer but I couldn't figure out the password, nor could I figure out how to work it at all.
