I had been working at Safeway as a courtesy clerk (a nice way of saying bag boy) for some time, and this strongly affected my trip. A requirement of the job was for me to greet every customer I came into contact with, and offer help in finding different products. Most customers seemed annoyed rather than grateful for the offer. I began to feel as though I was a voyeur prying into other peoples lives. I felt like I was slowly becoming yet another one of Safeways countless products. Customers would not treat me as another human, but as a nuisance barging in upon their pleasant little sheltered lives.
