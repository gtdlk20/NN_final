I felt energized and positive beyond belief. Every person I encountered was beautiful, another me. I could feel so much love for strangers. Attractive women no longer appealed to me sexually, I just saw them as beautiful beings, a platonic love. I clearly remember feeling sad as well throughout the day because I knew that what I was feeling, the aftermath of the experience would fade. LSD taught me that. I had a difficult time thinking about my experience the whole day without breaking into tears. So I put it out of my head often, yet I was sad that the memories would fade, that this feeling would fade and I would once again become a half-asleep program in the matrix. I was sad that the memories would fade, that this feeling would fade and I would once again become a half-asleep program in the matrix.
