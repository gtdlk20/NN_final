Yet another amazing point in the trip was going outside to the post office with K and J. For the record, he took 1.75 grams, but was already almost completely down. We walked outside, and as they continued walking down the path, the snow on the rail caught my eye. I knew that they continued walking, and I knew that they would make a big deal of it, but it was just too beautiful to pass up. I could see, intermingled in the snow, beautiful patterns and sparkles popping in and out, and a general sense of fluidity on the surface. When we came in and sat in my dorms lobby, just a little room the exact same size as a dorm (it actually was a dorm, but we used it as the lobby this year) K made some pop corn or kettle corn or something he got from my room.
