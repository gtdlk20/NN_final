I wen't to help them however I was too scared to handle the grater it was too loud and too noisy, I kinda look like I was cutting human bones. So, I stoped and sitted on a wooden chair and just listen to them gossip about other people, this made me really happy and got me in the right mood, so I started to clean with a broom a part of my backyard that was too trashy, this also made me happy and realise that I don't need to be confined in a room to have a nice experience. All this time they didn't notice that I was on something, not even my wife (I told her later and she didn't belive me haha).
