Once we got out we ran back upstairs refusing to use to lift for obvious reasons of not wanting to be trapped inside a small steel box. Once upstairs we headed outside but stopped at the close up tanks. These were a collection of 4 circular tanks with magnifying glasses over them allowing you to get a close up of the creatures inside. The one that grabbed our attention was the one containing Moray Eels. There were about 10 of them all wrapped together in what looked like a nest of maggots. They were absolutely revolting but it was impossible to look away. The front one looked like it was advancing towards and threatening us, while another smaller one looked like it was being crushed by its friends. Once outside we stopped by the touch pool. Feeling the slimy scaly surface of the stingray was creepy but at the same time very exciting. This particular situation was even better since we were the only people over 10 who actually wanted to touch what was in the pool.
