IÂ’ve spent a fair amount of my life in the woods and knew of an area within walking distance which was exceptionally beautiful, with some lakes, some woods and some more open hilly areas and thought it would be a good physical analogue to see if I could make the whole journey there and back in one piece. It was the day after my birthday and I was feeling extremely optimistic about the day and my life.
