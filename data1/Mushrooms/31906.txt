As we got onto the train, we both sat at the back of the carriage and totally absorbed into the seat. The softness and comfort that I felt was totally overwhelming. Glancing down at my watch I tried to read the time, but the Roman numerals looked foreign and odd- they appeared to be nothing I had seen before. I looked back up at my friend, who had multiple faces separating and colliding with each other. I found this humorous and simply laughed. The longing for a warm, comfortable place to relax was too strong and so we decided to head to our friends house. The train was tolerable at this point, however as more and more different people filled the seats in the carriage - I started feeling incredibly anxious and uneasy. Looking around at all the different people on the train, I realised how insignificant and small I was, how I am just a tiny human on this huge planet and began questioning my physical importance. I thought about death, about what the experience of dying would be like and the afterlife. I longed to die. I longed to see if there was more to leaving this earth, was there really an existence of heaven and hell? I was totally immersed in my thoughts.
