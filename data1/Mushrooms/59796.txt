Hit after hit, I would lay back on the trampoline and stare into the sky, which was purple and my eyes (so dilated) could see every star and any and all interactions in the sky. The trees in his backyard were incredible, I layed back, looked up and through the small spaces between the leaves I began to have hallucinations of color and pattern for incredible length. I could look into some of the plants and see acient rituals, or people dancing, always in vivid rainbow colors. I lost track of the voice inside my head and my true voice, at most points I didn't know whether I was talking or thinking. And I became aware that at some points I was whispering some pretty nonsensial things. It was truly the most wonderful and entertaining experience I've ever had.
