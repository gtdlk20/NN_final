I became very uncomfortable and could not hold still.  I began thinking that I had eaten too many mushrooms and that I was going to go insane.  I tried to eat something, thinking that since I had fasted for 16 hours prior to eating the mushrooms that putting some food in my stomach might diminish their effect.  Eating was an extremely difficult undertaking.  I was overly aware of each little movement of my jaw and teeth.  It took too long to chew.  I started to feel nauseous and gave up on eating.
