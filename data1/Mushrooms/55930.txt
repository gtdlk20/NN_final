These were some fucked up shrooms. That's not a normal trip, I've never heard of anything like that happening to anyone on shrooms, maybe it's just my weird mind in the state it was in, interacting with all those little things that were goin on, transforming them into perceptions of something very different. I've done quite a bit of shrooms before, every time other than that one, I've handled em very well, had amazing times and loved every second of it. This was a weird trip.
