I've recently helped a friend set up his own terrarium, and after calling around, he managed to find a couple of 2nd hand stores that had humidifiers for less than $10. They were the rotating-cone type of atomizer which may not be as good as an ultrasonic, but were suitable for the job. So shop around, a humidifier is worth the time and expense.
