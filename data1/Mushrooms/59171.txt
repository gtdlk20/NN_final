I began the night thinking that the mushroom gods might not be favoring me on this particular evening, and if they weren't they soon changed their minds. My fellow trippers and I ate the mushrooms as soon as we got them. I ate three grams, as did my friend Kancer. This was at about 11:45 pm. Betty and Veronica(not their real names) each ate one and a half grams. The mushrooms kicked in really fast, I could feel them starting within twenty minutes. At the half-hour point I was well on my way, as was everyone else. We decided to make our way downstairs to smoke some herb. We smoked a bowl and sat listening to 'We Can Dance' by David Bowie. We noticed that Veronica was missing, it turned out that she went out somewhere. We went upstairs and tripped out a bit, and Veronica returned fairly soon, She went out with another girl and picked some flowers. We went back downstairs to smoke more pot, now joined by two more people. We smoked a bowl while we sat their with our thoughts, spiraling through the universe and its fantastic possibilities. I remember having a discussion about colors, and if black and white are colors, and if there's such a thing as an anti-color.
