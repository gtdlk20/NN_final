At this point we knew we were in for something amazing. We began throwing couch pillows at each other and catching them, one in each hand, like it was happening automatically. It was as if my reflexes were improved drastically and seemed to be working on their own. Dee and I began to run around to different parts of the room examining and concentrating on things. When I would concentrate on something visually, every outline in my entire visual field began to become wavy and almost look as if it was melting. I also began to notice intricacies and patterns I had never seen before in things from the way his room and the things in it were built, all the way to different designs in the wood grain of his pool table. I ran over to a mirror on the wall and looked at my face. I had a brief thought that I looked more animalistic for some reason, almost mousy. I stared at my reflection until the shadowing and even expression and outlines of my face began to change and distort, this gave me anxiety so I ran over to the couch and sat behind it with my back to it. Dee came and sat next to me and began talking about how this is the most fun thing hes ever done. As soon as I could agree with him I turned my head to look above my shoulder and the couch looked as if it was the size of a skyscraper. Either that or I was extremely tiny. I stood up and Dee and I both dove on opposite ends of the now normal sized couch. It was almost as if me and Dee were having all of the same exact hallucinations and experiences at the same time. It couldnt believe this was really happening.
