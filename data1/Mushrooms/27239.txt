At this point, I was only seeing major visions while my eyes were shut, but they were very interesting.  I then began to think, instead of just sit and imagine images.  I had thoughts only of realization.  I saw myself as being an intelligent, grown person.  I felt I had realized how much I have grown, and thought of some of the things I thought as being very wrongÂ…such as leaving my girlfriend.  Listening to her, I had realized that she is a very wonderful person, and cared for me even when I was tripping (something she was against), and even while I was broken up with her.  About an hour or so later, the major tripping stopped.
