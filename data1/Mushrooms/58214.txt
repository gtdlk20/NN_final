Nothing too special happened, no gnomes running around or feeling like I have powers to control time or anything, besides it was a low dose but when mixed with the Marijuana it gave me a very nice outlook on things.  Since then I can now always see the world in a more beautiful way and appreciate art, mainly paintings a lot more even when sober.  I am very glad I did them.  It wasnÂ’t for another 2 months that I did them my second time, at a higher dose.  I will write about that too, and it will be a much shorter story.
