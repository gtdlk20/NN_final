What I took I am still not sure about to this day, but it has no resemblance to any psilocybin trip that I have heard of and is a lot closer to the LSD trips that I have heard of.  Of course many people say that the trips are very similar.  I had done shrooms once before with a friend and had eaten an eighth of them then as well.  I smoke marijuana a little more than occasionally and was intrigued with tripping.
