After that I pretty much had come down and was out of the experience completely but O was still having his experience. While he was having his experience I felt his thoughts, I felt his emotions, and I experienced every aspect of his trip that remained. When he went to the bathroom I felt something was wrong so I went to check up on him and found out he looked in a mirror which I warned him about. At one point I felt love and compassion and I later found out he was thinking about his girlfriend through his trip. And when his trip took a detour into darkness I felt that as well when his trip took a detour into darkness I felt that as well. We experienced the same thoughts at the same time and it was incredible.
