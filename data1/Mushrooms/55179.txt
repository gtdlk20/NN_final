Now is when things started to get good. At the part where Dorothy is being interrogated as to whether she is a good or bad witch, I seemed to know I was on to something. I left my room to use the bathroom, and while there I realized I was most definitely tripping. The whole concept of space bent a little bit, and it was hard to judge distances since things moved a little bit. Looking at the rows of brilliant lightbulbs over the mirror, I could see kaleidoscopic patterns in each. Looking in the mirror was more fun than anything else, though. I looked at myself and watched me turn into an old man, and then into a hairy, ogre-like thing. Finally I stared at my reflection long enough that I became nothing but a series of pastel and neon colors collected together in the shape of a man. The whole room took on this aspect for about a minute before it changed back.
