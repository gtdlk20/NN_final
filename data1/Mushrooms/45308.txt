T= 3:00 - Now we were full on tripping. We were watching a waterfall, and watching the bottom was very trippy. I was thinking very differently about life: like how everything, I am experiencing it for the first time. I told myself that everything was always different, and that an individual life is worth very little to the entire universe. Two of my friends decided during this time to smoke a bowl of marijuana, and I joined them for this. JP was fine with just tripping. The marijuana increased the intensity of my experience. I remember talking to JP about a whole lot of nothing, and ending the conversation with, That being said, those trees look pretty ill, which shows my appreciation for nature during my experience. I remember JP saying that he hated the car. I agreed. We left the waterfall after an hour and a half.
