I layed down on a mattress, and stared at the wall. I immediately noticed all sorts of psychadellic patterns, similar to the stoner artwork you've probably seen all over the internet. Before I never really understood how someone could come up with those intricate, beautiful and detailed patterns, but after taking mushrooms I sure as hell understand! Anyways I stared at the ceiling for about a half hour. At this point my emotions took hold and I once again became very scared and uncomfortable, and decided I needed to talk to a close friend.
