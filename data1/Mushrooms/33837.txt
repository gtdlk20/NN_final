T +1:30 Â– The lights go out. The trip takes a turn for the good and I feel far more at peace than I did an hour earlier. I hear voices in my head. They scare me to an extent but are comforting. They have a divine feel to them. They sound wise and at ease. They gave me advice and comforted me. I now think of this as simply my subconscious coming to the surface. Everything passed to me from these divine spirits I already knew. This makes me feel rather divine and omniscient.
