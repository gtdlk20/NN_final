So were still waiting, and waiting and waiting, mixed with a small car trip that we were forced to go on with my girlfriends mother to pick up her sister from high school (she didnt trust us to remain at the house by ourselves).  That was about as awkward as hell.  The trip included a huge argument between her and myself on the ethics of calling the DEA on your daughter before knowing anything about what you were doing or even before consulting her, or even calling them at all and keeping it a civil matter.  I still think she wanted her daughter to get some jail time (my girlfriend and I still may, we dont know yet), because when she discovered that we had voided ourselves of legal technicalities, she blew up and started to throw things, scream about how she wanted me dead, and how I was the route of all evil, etc.
