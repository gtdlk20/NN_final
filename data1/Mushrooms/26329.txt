9:00pm - Everyone is still laughing and things are starting to become more interesting.  I found a box of colored markers and just looked at them for a little while because they were pretty.  A sketchbook was on the floor and all the images inside were really interesting.  I started to visualize what they might really be about and to see words in the images.  I then decided it was time to get up and walk to the bathroom.  I still didnÂ’t believe that visual distortions and hallucinations actually existed and was soon to change my mind.  I stumbled across the room and put my shoes on to go downstairs.  The stairs took a long time to negotiate and I noticed that my hands moving looked kind of strange.  Kind of like in a fast running strobe light where I would see several ghost images of the edges of my hands blurred out to the sides.  The doors on the long hallway seemed to do this as well and the hallway seemed like it extended and got longer.  The textures in the bathroom were intriguing and even the rust spots in the commode were interesting.  They seemed to get up and kind of swim around and I remember thinking they were fish and that I was urinating into a pond.  On the walk back I had to stop and stare at the large wooden doors at the bottom and top of the stairs.  The grain in the wood was fascinating.  I wanted to touch it because I could see rainbows and all sorts of colors in the wood.  The grain seemed to pop out at me and flow around.
