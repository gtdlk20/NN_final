I leaned over to my sister and said to her, grinning and giggling uncontrollably, 'I think I've found an alternate universe.'  Demonstrating, I looked over to the right side of the universe, and then swiftly looked over to the left, pulling my head through the invisible barrier.  I was like a parent who, hiding their face behind their hands, expects a baby to be suprised at their 'sudden appearence.'  It was really just an inter-dimensional game of 'Peek-A-Boo'.  My sister nodded and smiled knowingly, looking comforted, I think in retrospect, at the assurances that her brother was OK and having a peaceful, happy time.  I played with the invisible barrier for a long time.  I certainly never expected to encounter anything like it.
