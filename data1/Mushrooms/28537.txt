I finished the pumping-up of the tire and we set off to the party which was situated right at the banks of a river, some 2 ks out of the perimeter of the city. At one point, we had to cross the street taking an underpass. I drove a good deal in front of S. and found (or I thought at least) where to cross and indicated that she follow me. She waved back that she understood  and drove away in exactly the opposite direction. I was quite stunned for a second and a strong wave of nausea ran through my body and for a second I thought Huh, what is this? and remembered that I had taken some tiny 3 shrooms. They were way stronger than expected - nothing of the just that it tickles a bit kind.
