Previous to the experience, I had done shrooms once before, to the tune of around 3 grams. It was a trip, to be sure, but it was mostly just recreational - I didn't learn anything from it really, and only felt emotionally and physically exhausted afterwards. The reasons behind this are many, poor setting, no sitter, ingested over a LONG period of time, etc.
