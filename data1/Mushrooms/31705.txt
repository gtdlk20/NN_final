Its a friday. I was at work and randomly started to think about trying 5 dried grams in silent darkness. I am a huge fan of Terence Mckenna so I was very interested to see what he was talking about. I had previously done shrooms many times but all 3g or lower. Also previous mushroom use has been purely recreational but recently I began using them as the tool they really are.  So while I was at work I decided tonight was the night I try 5 grams. I finished work, grabbed 5 grams of mushrooms and heading for T's house. In the past all my best psychedelic experiences have been with J so I asked him to trip sit and he agreed. The setting was perfect. J and I got to T's house and all hung out and smoked some herb. T had to leave for work which was perfect because I needed his room/bed to trip in. After T left for work I consumed the mushrooms, smoked a little more herb and laid down to wait for it all. J was sleeping on the floor during the trip, although I could not see him his presence made me feel at ease.
