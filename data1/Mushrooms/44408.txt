When the vibes finally begin to clear, we sit cross legged facing each other. My friends says he felt like he needed to go through that. It was an ego death of sorts. The cognitive dissonance between what was happening and what he thought was too much. We stare at each other and all of sudden this zen like aura encompasses the room. My friend transforms into Lao Tzu, sitting like a zen master, in perfect harmony, the room is no longer there, it is ethereal light surrounding everything, the vision subsides.
