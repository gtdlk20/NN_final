The fog went away about 10 minutes later and I decided to just walk with no destination in mind, hoping to find something to apply my deep psychedelic complex mind to beneficially. My brain became exruciatingly scrambled, I basically had a mystical experience, the memory not accessible now as a sober man. I felt I was removed from this reality like a game piece is removed from the box and I was just existing in this synapse between alternate realities that seemed like an eternal state, maybe it's death, maybe I glimpsed the vaults of death.
