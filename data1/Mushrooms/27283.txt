This is an account of my first true psychadelic experience. I had done mushrooms 2 times before, but both times I only had about 1 mushroom, and didnt feel anything at all. Last night, my friend Bill bought 2 ozs.  Of mushrooms. I ate 1/8, must have been about 7 or 8 shrooms. We then went on a journey for orange juice, and came back to the house. There we watched T.V. and waited.
