A bit of a preface: Some of you reading this may disagree with how I chose to spend this trip. The duration of this trip took place overnight in my room at my parents' house over some video games and music and cats. I understand that it's advised to go outdoors or trip with close friends but when it comes to drugs for me, especially psychedelics, I much prefer the solo route -- the introspective route. For me, it's important that my setting is impeccable, comfortable and undisturbed. The downside however is that if you get lost in your head, you're at the mercy of yourself to find your way back.
