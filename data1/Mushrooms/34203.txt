The room started elongating and the ceiling was a theater of rainbow color swirls. People's faces started swirling into themselves and 'B' turned green. I kept on thinking about what they thought was going on in my mind, and how much of a wack-job I must look like. It was amusing to think about that. Then the room lost all verticle and horizontal properties, so I closed my eyes. And I saw these rotating Hindu Swastikas on the back of my eyelids, growing bigger, and bigger with a technicolor, ROY G BIV backdrop. It was a beautiful moment.
