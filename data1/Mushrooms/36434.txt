T+40mins A bunch of people are still downstairs watching TV, blaring music, and playing cards, but myself and a few others, including the inhabitant of the house, all go upstairs to the quieter more controlled environment of his room. We all sit and talk for quite awhile, watching a bit of South Park, listening to Dark Side of the Moon etc. My friend who owns the house, we'll label him K plays guitar for awhile as we all chat, and he asks me if I'm feeling it yet. I tell him no, and explain that I ate just before I arrived at his place.
