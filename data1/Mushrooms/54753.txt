I see now a beautiful scene.  Aliens are here on earth, although they are not so alien.  They are us, we are them.  They love us, and we love them.  We share the sacred mushroom together.  I see primitive men collecting mushrooms.  I see them consuming them.  I see primitive men growing mushrooms in the wilderness, providing them with food, water, performing rituals to worship them.  They truly are a gift from God to these people, and to myself.
