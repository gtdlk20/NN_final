T +0:30  At this time I feel absolutely nothing and anticipate another failed attempt. I want this to be an epic experience, a turning point in my life, so I vouch to take two more 1.25g doses instead of just one more. I do the same as I did with the first 1.25g but with 2.5g at once. I swallow it at 11:11PM as I love this time for its the only time you see 4 of the same number on a clock. A knock on the door, its my mom. This makes me very nervous as she just caught me a week earlier smoking Cannabis in this same fashion. I hide all my stuff under my bed and let her in. She says good night and leaves. I was relieved nothing happened yet this set my heart in motion. I feared this would bloom into a bad trip later on. I relax myself, slowly.
