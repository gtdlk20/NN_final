I got bored with the TV and decided to take a shower. That was awesome. The bathroom instead of being kind of cheap and dirty (a cheap apartment bathroom), it was colorful and luxurious. The sound of the water and the stream of it splashing around was mesmerizing and I did not want to leave. The tub was plain white plastic with glass doors, but became a large tiled shower with lots of room and was very beautiful. I however got a bit paranoid thinking I was in the shower too long and the neighbor below would think it strange. I certainly did not want any neighbors checking in on me in this condition. So I ended the shower and went back to the TV to find out more about me, but it was no longer about me.
