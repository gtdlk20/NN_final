-- U.S. law prevents me from using harmless psilocybin, yet allows folks to legally intoxicate themselves into a blathering stupor with an addictive, poisonous substance: alcohol. What's up with that? All it takes is one psilocybin experience to appreciate the disturbing double standard here.  I really have to tip my hat to the Dutch for their rational approach to these issues.
