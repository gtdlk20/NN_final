I began laughing nervously as I looked over to my friend , wondering if he had began tripping to. It took me by total suprise when I saw my freinds face had skeleton bone patterns moving all over. It was suggested that we smoke more pot but I was going to crazy from my surroundings to gather my thoughts to get my pipe and pot out. I was in awe of my freinds face melting away. I eventually managed to load another bowl and we smoked. My arms looked like they were under kalida-scope vision and I saw mesquito bites on my arms dancing around. My veins in my arms began to change and make diamond patterns.
