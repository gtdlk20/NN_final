There were little rainbow hazes around the candle flames which was really pretty.  I laid on my back staring at my ceiling and saw some vague designs start to form.  That was where the trip started.  Of course it was not what I was expecting, it wasnÂ’t always a visual trip except during the height of it and when I would gaze at something.  It seemed to flow from an emotional trip to mental to visual and back again.  I would feel an emotion rise up with a certain memory and I would feel it so intensely as if I were experiencing it again which then would shift to a mental trip where I would then contemplate the emotional and come to realizations about that time in my life or that experience, it shifted between these two for a while and then the visuals started to happen more intensely but only when I gazed.
