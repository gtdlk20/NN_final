All in all I say it was a learning experience. I learned that I should never ever shroom again with drunks. And that doing harder drugs like crack and such who lead to a horrible and disgusting life like I had envisioned in the hotel room. From that day forth I only smoke weed and do shrooms on occasion. I am not going to let this bad experience deter me from doing shrooms I think they are awsome but I now use extreme caution when using like anyone should. Thanks for reading!
