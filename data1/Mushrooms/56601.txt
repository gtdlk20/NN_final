After a few minute of enlightenment and euphoria, I can only describe how I started to think as rapid realizations and thoughts about life. I started to ramble on about Why am I me? Why are you you? What do you think being a dog is like? Why do we get the privilege of being human beings? I also felt like everything else in the world that I had only read about or seen on TV, such as foreign countries and everyone in the government were all just made up or something. They just didnt feel real.
