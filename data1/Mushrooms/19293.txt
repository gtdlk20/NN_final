I felt almost like I needed to puke, and I mentioned this. Miel suggested I just puke in the bath tub, and we would wash it all down. Alice suggested I just puke over the side of the tub. I insisted I would rather puke in the toilet, like any sane individual would. I got up, thinking I was going to puke, but the sensation went away. Again, I felt the inevitability. I would have to puke, and finish my bath, and make love to Miel, and everyone else would have to eat the snow, and Cory would have to acknowledge his existence, before the trip could end. I laid back down in the bath, happy that for the moment at least, I didnÂ’t have to puke.
