Back in the black light section he was playing with all of these toys and making our visual effects seem so much better. While we were playing back there, the green hair dude came back over. We asked him if he can steal us stuff and put it in the hallway so we could pick it up. He agreed and stole us some ozzy osborn figurines and a strobe light (I loved that strobe light J).
