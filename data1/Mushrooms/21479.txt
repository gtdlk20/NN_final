Now that I was back to myself, I was 'loose' in space time.  I got up to go to the bathroom, and my partner called out that it was 4-something am, and I was glad for the frame of reference.  I started imagining that I was flickering along alternate points in space time. At some times, I was in 'normal' time, in bed listening to the house while tripping on mushrooms.  At other times, I was in an old girlfriend's bed. At others, I was at home.  During each slip, there were alternatives, such as me imagining a timeline while tripping that I was shot and killed by a robber, and another where I had always lived at this house.  I felt it important to remember and hold onto mentally the 'correct' time line, or there would be dire consequences.

This was difficult, though, as my high mind was very curious about the others, but I worked diligently at not being distracted enough to explore them.
