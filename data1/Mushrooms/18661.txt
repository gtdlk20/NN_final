I do remember imagining that I was on an operating table, half 'put under', as is done in a lot of operations these days. (That is when you are still semi-conscious, while they cut you open.) So I was imagining that even though I was not rationally thinking through all my therapeutic concerns, 'work' was being done. This is in line with modern research on psychedelics and neuroscience which is showing that psychedelics may facilitate neuro-plasticity and a rewiring of the brain. Meaning even while not thinking through my depression, the medicine was working to heal it by slowing down the overactive blood flow to the control centers of the brain.
