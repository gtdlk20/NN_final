Back at the house and after walking around the woods this mind state continued but got a lot worse. I became separate from my mind. Thinking back I suppose this is the ego loss people talk about but at the time I thought I had gone mad. My mind was thinking itÂ’s own thoughts and I was watching it think them? This continued for a while. Neil was on the phone talking to some people he called and was saying that he was fucked but I thought he said I was fucked? This lead me to believe that he had come round to watch a DVD or something, only to find me completely nuts and he was ringing for help or something!! I forgot I had eaten the shrooms and panic set in. It was like my memory was only 3 seconds long and I kept forgetting who I was, what I was doing and what I was about to do.
