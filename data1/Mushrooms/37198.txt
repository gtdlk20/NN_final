We had begun our quest for mushrooms Friday, the day before, but due to problems with our friend being too high to answer his cell phone, spent the night eating Dexedrine out of boredom and consolation, consider it a sort of licking our wounds. It was I, my girlfriend Carissa, and our friend Wally, in a grinding teeth stupor, awake and disappointed, thinking that the mushroom thing would never happen.
