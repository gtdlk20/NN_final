We noticed a clearing and upon arriving at it we realized it was the perfect meadow. Small grasses, wild flowers, beautiful bugs, everything we could ask for.  By this time we were feeling it so powerfully that we could barely stand. We sat down and talked to the bugs. I spent about 2 hours looking at the clouds, which were making pictures, swirling and rolling like an ocean. Colors were bright, and everything was extremely over-stimulating.  Ugly things were beautiful to me and the (real) bugs crawling all over my arm were not a threat, but my friends.  I remember talking to a bee, saying, 'Look at you over there bee.  Just doing your job so wonderfully and polinating like you should.  How great!'  Or something bizarre like that.  The small hairs on my friend's face were crawling all over and they made me laugh.
