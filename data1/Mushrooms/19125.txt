This cracked my companions up hardcore. They laughed, and laughed. Although I did not laugh at the beginning, the laughter quickly became contagious, and I found msyelf laughing hysterically, deep belly laughs. The hilarity of how silly my own and others laughter sounded right now only triggered greater howls and wails. Monkey, who was chilling out in his room down the hall, commented to us the next day that our laughter hadnt sounded like normal laughter, and that it rose and fell in some kind of wave sequence patterning.
