I got up and strolled off down the gently winding, soft grassy path. I spotted a red squirrel, sitting up on his hind legs staring at me from across the field. He hopped off into the tree line. I sat down again and gazed across the stunning beautiful stretch of Earth before me. The engine was revving and the wheels were rolling down the runway. Trays in upright position, seat belt fastened. The landscape- the curves and soft turns of the grassy hills and the lines of pines and maples that rode atop them suddenly seemed inflated- as if a giant had blown air into the world.  The sky seemed to have closed in some and the dramatic bands of clouds seemed  well  closer to the tree lines. And the trees themselves seemed to be calling my attention This is how it is when there are no droughts or man made interferences  we flow- easy breezy  harmony. This is how it is suppose to be.  I felt somewhat dissolved  as if I were blending in to all around me.
