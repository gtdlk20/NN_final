I found myself up on a small hill on the other side of the lake and walked down to a part that I saw but had previously seemed inaccessible. I felt great about the journey I was making and saw migrating cows on the side of the lake I had sat at while coming up. It was very raw and natural, like I was getting to see something people normally wouldnt see from a place people normally wouldnt find. I had a semi-dream like vision, kind of like how I zone out when driving but still see the road etc but am focused on some internal imagery, of a girl I know. The symmetry of her face and her in general seemed so effortlessly beautiful and whole. Her beauty and beauty in general appeared to me as self-sustaining, like a water droplet on a lily pad which is held up and spherical by its own water tension. The migrating cows and the area had the same delicate yet unmistakably powerful feeling.
