It was the last day of our Spring break.  We would start the long drive home that night.  I got up early and caught a train to downtown Miami by myself.  My plan was to eat the last of my shrooms and visit some museums. I got off the train and went to the bathroom where I ate 2.5 grams of mushrooms. I then ate breakfast in the station while I waited for the effects to kick in.  After about 30 minutes, I still had not felt anything.  I left the station and sat in a nearby, small park, while I waited for the art museum to open up.  There were hundreds of butterflies that I had not noticed until I sat down in a wide, grassy spot.  They were neat to look at, but I couldnt tell if the mushrooms were having any effect or not.  I was intensely and furiously analyzing myself, hunting for any effects of the mushrooms, which in retrospect was a bad idea.  It was probably part of the reason I didnt experience much to begin with.
