I still have access to memory. Now I have to keep moving, if I stop moving my mind exaggerates it and I start to de-animate into stone. It is a rule that I must keep moving about. There is far more significance in everything now as they all evoke emotions, whatever I imagine of what I am seeing; it represents all those things simultaneously. It may be that my brain is devoting all its power to only a few things at once. I certainly lose any sense of self whenever I am enraptured by something.  Laying on the bed, I feel like my body is being split into two, but its such a pleasant affair, like Im shedding a cocoon. I am constantly fighting being heavy, the more I think about it, the more it becomes the new reality.
