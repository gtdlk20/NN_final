As for what I was going through mentally. I began thinking of the universe, and I slowly started breaking down layers and layers of actual existence until I got to the lowest form of life, atoms. I went through every chemistry and physics class I had ever taken in around thirty minutes. And after thinking of all the molecular science, I went on and convinced myself, that the world we live in, the existence that I had survived in for so many years, wasn't real. This was a hard thing to come to terms with for me, it was a very profound thought, and such a shock to my system. Existence was nonexistence. At this point I had probably been peaking for around 2 hours, 2 hours of no control over my own reality.
