We decided we needed a change of scenery and went to a room with couches and a record player. We initially put on The Who's Tommy but realized we didnt want to hear it and put on a Jimi Hendrix album. We layed on the couches and watched the show. It must have been around 4 am and I was having the most intense visuals I've ever seen. Full closed eye patterns and kaleidiscopes. The whole room was rippling. There was crown molding running along the top of the walls and when I stared at it, it actually turned into pipes that looked like they were pumping some strange green liquid all over the house; very strange. This was the only time I even came close to freaking out and it was simply becuase it was 4 am and if I closed my eyes in order to sleep I could still see a spectacular light show.
