So, 12 days later, on Xmas eve, I decided to try something new that I got, psilocybe cyanescens in powder form.  I measured out carefully about 2.4 g, which the dosage calculator on shroomery said was equivalent to 3.6 of cubensis.  The vendor said 1g is nice, 2g is strong and 3g is the limit.  With my own foolishness and feeling of despair about life (despite being lucky in many ways- I did not feel it), I wanted to go a little further.
