I was back in my excited phase, but still convinced that maybe I did something weird. I was obviously starting to come down, but I wasn't going to remember what sober was until morning still. I almost became erect, it felt so good to lye down on a comfortable, inflatable mattress with 20 blankets on it and a propane heater next to it and smoking some of the best pot. She had some very tasty goods. We talked and I tripped her out because I was so high. She comforted me and made me feel welcome and I felt so loved I secretly expelled a few tears when she wasn't looking.
