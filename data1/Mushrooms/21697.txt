Unconsciously the most significant world I had travelled to was an infinite expanse of swirling and interlocking colors and fractals with no real definition of time or space. I was not even some sort of physical manifestation within this world, just another part of the endless swirl. While I was there I felt like everything had already happened, I was currently experiencing the past, and there was no such concept as present. It was here that I felt so insignificant, that I had reached a higher plane of existence, that because I was here, it didn't matter if my body died or anything. I would consider this the peak of the trip, whenever it happened. Other subconscious experiences were incredible. I travelled into a wild world of my imagination, seeing fantastic creatures that defy description. In here I had a physical manifestation of a muscular man with a prism for a head. At one point I battled a great horned fractal beast with a rippling sword made of tessellated diamonds. I also had a period where I entered the game Oblivion and though this world was not nearly as psychedelic, everything still had a rainbow sheen to it. Recent memories and dreams kept popping up, completely distorting my perception of time, and I vividly relived happenings from earlier in the day/the night before, along with being able to freely explore psychedelic versions of my dream worlds. It almost felt as though I was lucid dreaming. At one point the room fell away to reveal a vast cityscape inhabited by faceless white people in work clothes.
