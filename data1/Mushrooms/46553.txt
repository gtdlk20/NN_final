My stomach was starting to not feel so great so I turned and layed down and stared up at the ceiling.  There was a round light that I came to focus on and watched in amazement as inside of it I could see images playing as if it were a mini tv screen.  I watched a family seated for dinner, and then my father appeared at which I laughed hysterically because I knew that he knew as he looked down on me.  Next the Tom Cruise version of War of the Worlds came on and I could see the little scouts exploring throughout the house.  I then closed my eyes and entered into a whole new world.  I went flying across the canyons of Lake Powell and even went snowboarding, it was all so vivid.  The best part was that I could control it all, whatever I wanted to do or go see, I could, I just had to think it and believe it and there it would be.  As I lay there the rest of my friends finally came upstairs.  I was looking at them with my head upside down and asked enthusiastically how they had figured out how to walk on the ceiling.
