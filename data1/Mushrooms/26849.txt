I had heard that onset took approximately 20 minutes.  This time passed, and it felt like nothing was happening.  So I got up and walked around my house; That's when I realized that everything around me was very, VERY out of proportion, in the tactile sense.  I looked down at my hands, and they seemed very far away, and my sense of gravity became highly distorted, almost to the point of vertigo.  I walked from the living room into the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror; my pupils were dilating and constricting at a very rapid pace.  I then walked back to my room and lay down on my bed again.  I put on my headphones and began listening to Shpongle: Tales of the Inexpressible, as I looked up at my ceiling for a while.  That's when I began to see patterns, great, glowing monstrosities crawling all over my ceiling like Celtic strobe-lights from heaven, changing colors at a furious pace.  The designs and colors changed frequently, but they seemed limited to the focal point of my vision; whatever I was focusing on, the patterns appeared upon.  When I looked at my hands, my fingers started to change size and shape, and the glowing patterns where there too, crawling across my skin, and dancing underneath it, Celtic and tribal at the same time.
