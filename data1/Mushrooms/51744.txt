My thoughts were very circular and repetitive -- which can be tedious to bad on LSD, but seemed fine in this context.  I thought about the sexual frustration that comes with only using alcohol at clubs.  I realized that without the futile expectation of nookie, I could have fun and still appreciate the people around me in terms of attractiveness, i.e., looking, not leering.
