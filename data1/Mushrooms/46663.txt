I don't know for sure how far I was gone for, but I started preperations at around 12 AM, and when I came to, it was still light so a good few hours at least. I don't remember a great deal of the trip, but I experienced total ego-loss and disassociation, and became a liquid. I could feel myself (although I didn't recognise 'self' as a concept) dissolving and moving like a liquid, although I was, at the time, flat out on my bed. I remember trying to turn myself inside out, and seeing all my bone structure, blood vessels, and internal organs in a liquid fluid pool somewhere, just existing, at some strange dimension or point in space, so far from humanity that the ego, self, life itself were just inconceivable.
