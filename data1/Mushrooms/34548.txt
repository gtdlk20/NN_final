We set out to explore the back areas of the massive fields we have at my beautiful school, wandering along paths and streams until we got to a very suitable brook area that was covered by some trees. I took out a boombox that I brought so that we could all listen to music but talk to each other at the same time. I reassured everyone that any nausea they were feeling would pass and that relaxing and exhaling slowly would work wonders. We sat around underneath the beautiful pine trees and waited to feel the first waves of energy, a feeling of warmth I have learned to be comfortable with.
