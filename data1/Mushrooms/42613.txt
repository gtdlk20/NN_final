When I re-entered my room, I noticed that my cat had waltzed in behind me and made himself at home as he is one to do. I went over to him, sat down next to him and held him in my lap. This instantly cleared my head of any negativity that I brought upon myself. By simply holding my cat -- an instinctively loving, genuinely innocent, sentient creature -- my entire trip did a complete 180. I held and played with him while coming down and gave a sigh of relief. It was over. I didn't die, I didn't lose my mind, but I did come out of the trip with much more respect for the mushroom.
