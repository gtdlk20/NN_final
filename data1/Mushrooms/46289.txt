After this encounter Tim, Cathi and K decided it was time to leave since they were bored of AQWA even though Esther, Dylan and I werent. Since it closed in half an hour anyway it wasnt too big a deal although I did still bitch about it slightly. AQWA really is an amazing place to trip at. The environment that the animals live in is so alien to us its like being on another planet which the various fish, rays, lobsters and eels are its inhabitants.
