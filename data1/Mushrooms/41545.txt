I took about 3 grams of my homegrown mushrooms on an empty stomach, I just chewed them up and swallowed them and after the higher energy come up I then lay down and closed my eyes.  I first had many fast moving visuals in the beginning and then things slowed down and I had more of a continual vision that started off as more of a feeling then turned into a visual landscape. Slowly I begin to rise above a large landscape that appears to stretch off into an infinite distance. The landscape is not of trees and grass but of different and complex shapes, patterns and colors that all blend together.  This pattern included what seems to be hills, valleys and protrusions most made up of the pastel colors of blue, green and rose, the sounds I could hear were like thunder with a lot of buzzing and zapping and it all seemed to be very much alive and continued on and on into the horizon.
