I knew that I had eaten too many, but I thought I could handle it. We started to leave the beach and I felt really weak, it could have been from lying down in the sun and not drinking water. Time was going by very slow. When we finally got to the car I felt totally lost. I was tripping hard off music and voices. Sometimes I couldn't understand what my friends were telling me and music seemed to be mumbling. I had no clue where I was or were I was going. All that was running through my mind was tons of questions with no answers.
