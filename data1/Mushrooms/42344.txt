I have been shown something that I was not expecting.  I went into it with the wrong attitude and the shrooms decided to throw me into exactly what I wanted to see and even further.  I was not prepared, but, I plan to try it at some point again.  Thinking I will go over to one of my favorite nature reservations and find a quiet place for meditation, then most likely some exploration afterward.  But, this experience was the single most amazing, yet most terrifying experience of my life.  I have been humbled because of this experience.
