The water was getting cold, and I swam to the opposite shore.  There was a little outcrop of chair sized rocks, and nobody else there.  I knew that this was the perfect place to explore now that I was peaking (~+2:50).  I plastered my cold body against the biggest flat rock, feeling the cold leave my skin.  The sunlight dancing across the little wavelet tops made everything in my view sparkly, and the ledge I had just jumped down from (for the third time) was beginning to take the shape of a frog.   Across the water, I watched my friends.  Syph was perched on the birdshit rock, contemplating waterbugs.  Sugar was wandering in the woods down different paths, and Clock was still milling around the bags in his usual fidgety fashion.  Dummer was a rock downriver from them laying flat in the sun, attempting to take a light nap underneath the sunny skies.  A sparrow flew by overhead, and I watched it go, so fast that it left a streak that went off into infinity.
