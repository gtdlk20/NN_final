I further freaked out because I thought I was going to cause an electrical fire for some reason so I turned the fan off. I attempted to reach for my phone, which was my sense of comfort and connection to safety. I couldnt find my phone in the dark and I felt so lost. (I didnt have cellular connection anyway because of the concrete ceiling.) I was thirsty and wanted the cooling sensation of water, so I felt around for the water jug, and as a poor, scared child in the dark, I let the water pour into my mouth. I heard the noise of chains outside, which I believed was someone opening the property gate. I laid there and thought, I did a bad thing. I know it was bad. They can take me. I keep doing this. I need to be locked up. I know Im crazy. After several minutes, I opened the door and leaned on the door frame to accept my capture. I saw red flashing lights outside reflecting off the fence. I stood there for about a minute, waiting and dreading for them to come, but no one came. I gathered the courage to walk up the stone stairs and I peeked around the house and discovered that the lights and noise was from the neighbors property. It was a tow truck with flashing red lights, loading up a car. The lights and sounds of the chains still kept freaking me out due to my short attention span. I still wasnt sure if someone was coming or not.
