Friend #2 stood up at one point and suggested that we move to another location; however, none of us wished to leave. We felt too attached to where we were. He was fine with this, but told us that we should at least stand up. Friend #1 and I stood while Friend #3 continued to sit. I felt like I was walking for the first time in my life. My knees buckled, I stumbled around, always losing my balance. Once I finally composed myself, #2 ran down one of the paths. We stood there amazed at his speed and soon he was out of sight, but I could still feel his presence. While he was gone, I pulled out the rock from earlier and stared at it. I could feel great energy emerging from it. The three of us still at the camp gathered around the rock and silently touched it, feeling the power inside.
