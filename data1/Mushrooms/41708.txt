Somewhere around that time I wanted to heighten my trip even more and since I still had about a gram left, I just picked some up and ate them, dry. I felt very connected to nature. The rest were just sitting there and I didn't know what to do with them so I organized them by separated the caps from the stems, then ate the caps and left the rest of it there for later, or the next day, as I never wanted my trip to end.
