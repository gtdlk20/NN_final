I stayed in the same spot for a solid 2 hours.  I became deeply emerged in my own thoughts and thatÂ’s when I felt like I had reached nirvana and achieved enlightenment.  Everything in the world became connected.  I felt a connection in which I could not explain between emotions, objects, actions, places, people, time, ideas, and anything you could imagine.  I was overtaken by extreme feelings of joy and love.  I felt a deep companionship to a few good buddies and felt that they had to know.  I told all my close friends I loved them and called a few more just to tell them.  I had a strong urge to just hold someone in my arms.  I felt a strong love for Emma and called to tell her.
