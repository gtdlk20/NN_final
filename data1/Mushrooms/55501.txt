It seemed as if half an hour had passed when track 2 had begun, at this point I had some major halucinations, first my room began stretching, second my room turned into what seemed to be a black universe covered in green lines (Like in that simpsons episode where Homer goes behind the book case and discovers the 3rd dimension). I was fascinated and having a fun time. Every single minutes went by amazing slow though. Time was at an all time slow for me. I was unable to sit within one spot for long, I tried moving around but it felt like my legs were melted into the floor, and had to walk on my knees. After about a half hour passed (in real time), the black universe within my room had been replaced with purple and pink symbols, somewhat like that scene in The Matrix where neo begins seeing everything as numbers. This was totally awesome
