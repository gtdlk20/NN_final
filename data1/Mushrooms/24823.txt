At this point, more lucid thoughts began to creep in.  It was around this time that one of the strangest experiences of the trip occurred.  I was thinking in a fairly lucid manner.  However, in spite of my feeling of thinking somewhat clearly, my mind apprehended the most bizarre notions.  I cant easily get my mind around those notions at this point, so I can only point at what they were.  Basically, I was able to see that D and I were in a house.  But the time and place of that house were entirely alien to me.  It was clear to me that the time and place we were in, had no reference to the time and place of my life as I know it.   I specifically thought about my family and Ds family, and I realized somehow that we were in an entirely different place and we could not return to where we had come from.  It crossed my mind that we were tripping, but I was convinced beyond doubt that tripping was now out of the equation.  We had gotten to a place that we were not going to come down from.
