I decide to take them. They were baked in chocolate, and it was my first time. [I had eaten 3 (yes, 3) mushrooms picked from my backyard when I was younger and less intelligent (little brown mushrooms), and thought I had felt effects such as euphoria (I laughed a lot at nothing), vivid colors, and slight closed eye visuals (thought I saw a spider crawling underneath my eyelid before going to sleep; I wasn't that tired). After taking this 'real' dose, I do believe it's possible I may have experienced real effects that first time, however it seems highly unlikely due to such a small dose. Probably placebo.
