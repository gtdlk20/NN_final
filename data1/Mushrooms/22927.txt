So I finally did retreat underneath the covers, but I immediately realized how cold I was. I started violently shivering and for I don't know how long I kept telling myself, 'Just breath. Just breath.' over and over again. After a while I added to that, 'Stay awake.' I was afraid that I was going to fall unconscious into sleep in an effort to escape from the pain. I'm still not sure if the pain was caused by being out in near freezing weather for over an hour or if it was just a byproduct of the drug. Regardless, I began telling myself vehemently to stay awake. I retreat to sleep in order to escape from every other discomfort life throws at me. I was not going to waste this trip - which I expected so much from - by pissing it away on a dream.
