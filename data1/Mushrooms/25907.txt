T+0:00 - I dosed with 5.3 gram at a little after 8:30pm on a Monday.  I had not eaten in some eight hours.  As McKenna suggests, I did my best to clear my conscience.  Fortunately, things had recently calmed down in my life after a period of severe upheaval.  This had a lot to do with why I was so driven to do the heroic dose.  I wanted to get another one under my belt before any other unforeseen travesties should occur.  Also, I was hoping for a bit of healing or reassurance.  I know ayahuasca would probably have been better for that, but I also like the matrix of information the mushroom tends to drop one into.
