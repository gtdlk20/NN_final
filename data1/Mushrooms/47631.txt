I like mushrooms. A lot. The reason being every trip is like a gift, its always different. I learn something new everytime, usually about me but sometimes about a friend or a place.

And a very low hater presence. As a sort of house warming we decided to bite some fungus along with JunebugÂ’s girl M.
