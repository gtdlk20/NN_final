Then we had to celebrate the rest of 420 by buying a 20 of fire ass weed. My friend came later with a 50. We were smoking out of bowls and blunts. We even hot boxed an expedition. I actually smoked myself sober, or at least I felt sober. I had a bad headache so I went to bed. I woke up this morning feeling pretty good, still with a slight headache and exhausted. And that was pretty much my trip, it was the worst/best trip ever. I'm still trying to figure out what made my trip bad, the dehydration or too many shrooms.
