I left my room and walked into my living room where J was lying there staring at me. He told me he thought he died and I told him the same thing. I went into the bathroom and decided to look in the mirror. That was a bad idea considering what I saw staring back at me scared me a whole lot. I can't even remember what I saw in the mirror that night but I do remember it being one of the scariest things I've ever seen.
