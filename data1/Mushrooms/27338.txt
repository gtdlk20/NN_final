My lower back and legs feel kind of numb.  I smell Oldspice.  The smell is so strong it seems as though someone has sprayed some in the room.  We are listening to Phish's 'Farmhouse'.  I'm not seeing any CEV's or OEV's.  More talking about the use of cocaine at Ivy League schools.  I feel like I'm really stoned or almost a drunken feeling.  Reminds me of the time I ate 2g of schwag on some Leary Biscuits.  The plywood in front of me looks rather orange.  Also the dark brown hair on my arms and legs appears to be black.  Then I say 'Reality Check.  I have eaten mushrooms'.  R thinks that I am about to freak out.  I keep having abstract thoughts such as about close friends and family of mine.  D says to just go with the trip.  R, C, and I are talking about highschool, tattoos, and people we know.  C talks about how she was homeschooled for a few years.  We all talk about school and how it should be changed.  R, C, and I all went to the same middle and highschool.  I pay attention because after all I want to be a teacher someday.  I tell R and C that intelligence is nothing without the drive and motivation to work.  I notice several patterns.  A Polynesian pattern in the rug that looks like one of the tattoos the men wear on their faces.  In the Magic Eye books R and I see faces in the patterns on the pages.  I see Spanish faces R tells me he sees African faces.  The faces I see are very Picassoesque.  They remind me of the faces Picasso used in the painting Les Demoiselles dAvignon.    I think this is because of my immense travels in Spain and seeing paintings by Picasso.  In the foreground of one of the pages there is a tiger.  It has red eyes.  When I am sober its eyes are black as midnight.  R looks in the back at the answers.  One of them is Beethoven.  We talk about how incredible both he and his music are.  I wish I had brought one of my dad's classical CD's.
