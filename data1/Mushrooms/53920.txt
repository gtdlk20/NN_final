Take faith in the goodness of people, go create things, give to others altruistically and dont get caught up in the silly details of existence. Fashion and bank statements just do not matter. Shrooms have given me a glimpse into that vast, pulsing energy that we are all a part of. We are all just vessels, channeling it. I'm so glad for this realisation.
