This particular report is what I consider my first true trip, though I had ingested liberty caps from the same batch twice before. For some background, the first time was only one mushroom and had been largely unremarkable, save for some increased visual acuity and pattern recognition. The second time was about 1.5 grams, though this was eyeballed, as once again I hadn't bothered to weigh out an exact amount. This trip proved to be full of thought loops, but overall ended up being very positive and useful in that it familiarized me with the mental space. I should mention that this trip, along with all of my others save for two, was done alone. This is simply my preference, as I find I just worry way too much for my friends or get too caught up in conversation whenever we have tripped together.
