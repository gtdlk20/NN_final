This is where I stepped into the super dimension. I cant find anyway of saying this to justify what I saw but It was as though our 3 dimensions became insignificant. The room seemed to unfold in dimensions I cant describe. It was the equivalent to me peeling General Johnson off of the front of his album cover that Im looking at now and seating him next to me in our 3d world. He could still see the place he came from but it now looks like a flat, lifeless piece of nothingness compared to our world. He cant even perceive how he used to fit in there. Hes fucked up man. In my case I was peeled from the fabric of our 3d world and flung into this other place. What was in there? I dont know. Weird moving colours. The colours were amazing. It was like the effect of shitty CGI in a film. Everything looks clean and clearly alien to the rest of the picture.
