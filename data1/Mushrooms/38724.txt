I found myself shivering and twitching.  I had a smile that wouldnt go away and I couldnt relax my eyes.  My hands were sweating.  I was wringing my hands and squeezing my fingers.  I thought, my name is Manon and I have taken a drug.  Im in control though.  Why am I shivering?  I dont have to.  Im in control of my situation and Im going to relax and be warm. With that the chair wrapped its cushions around me and rubbed my shoulders gently.  I was warm and happy.  I couldnt stop smiling.  When someone looked at me I giggled uncontrollably.  This is the best drug in the world because Im in control.
