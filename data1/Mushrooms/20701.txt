In my 20s I tripped a few times on what turns out to be fairly small doses of magic mushrooms. For a long time I had no access to them until my brother in law Adam came up with about 8 grams one day about 3 years ago. He and a friend brewed up 2/3rds of them and saved a third for me to eat giving us each about 2.7 grams of dried mushroom each. The effects were as I remembered; turn up the color control on everything and a laugh riot of a night lasting about 5 hours. A general feeling of wellbeing afterwards and what I use to call a mind enema. The flushing out of your brain of those sometimes overwhelming  anxieties, compulsions and worries that we cant do a damn thing about, but that we let affect us, and perhaps a little insight or reminder about what is important the people you are travelling through life with.
