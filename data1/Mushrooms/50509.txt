This and the darkness scared me enough that I started wandering through the woods frantically trying to get out.  Instead of exiting as I came in I ended up in a huge open field, where people were walking their dogs.  There was more light here, so I was less scared.  By now, my trip was getting incredibly vivid, so much so that I got intense visual distortions even while I was walking.  The grass looked beautiful, and the remnants of the sun shone through a black silhouette of trees in the far distance.  It looked like a red water color bleeding into a blue, and then black, sky.
