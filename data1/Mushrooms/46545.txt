When I returned to the living room I sat next to Carly, and felt like we should never be separated.  She asked if we could please never move and I commented an how I was thinking the exact same thing, we were so warm and cozy.  At one point someone spilled a glass of water all over my feet, and I was simply thrilled at how good it felt.  However, some time after, I came to another specific idea, I was getting hungrier by the second, and if I didn't somehow get food, I couldn't be happy.  I came back from the kitchen with a package of Ritz crackers and began munching them.  The entire stack disappeared pretty quickly so I went to get the whole box and continued eating, thinking how funny it was that I could eat so much, so quickly.  Throughout the whole time I was in the living room, it was really difficult to form speech, and a lot of the time I was simply uttering strange noises and beeps, having thought that I had been reborn and needed to learn a new form of communication.  Stan and Caitlin were laying down looking up into 'The Universe' and I was amazed at how alive and colorful it had become.  It was rotating almost like a disco ball.
