The humid air goes along 1 inch PVC tube around a couple corners and into the aquarium.  Actually, the PVC tubing punches through a clear plastic furniture covering which is over the aquarium.  The covering is cut a minimum of two inches bigger than the actual aquarium top.  I taped one side of this covering and pulled the other over the aquarium.  The loose side of the plastic covering flap is held over the aquarium by a rubber band which stretches around the aquarium (actually it was a string of rubber bands tied together).  The humid air is released close to the floor of the aquarium, rises up around the cakes, and somehow escapes through the small imperfections in the plastic covering draped over the aquarium.  I did not and do not recommend you make holes specifically for exhaust unless you really have the plastic covering on tightly.
