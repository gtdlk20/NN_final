About an hour and a half later, I was peaking.  I hadn't opened my eyes in a while because of the visions, and that's when I heard the voice.  There was a man in my head!  Or so I thought.  He told me many things.  What I remember most though is when he first spoke to me.  He said, 'I am the Shaman.  These visions are a gift from me.'  I wasn't scared of the voice.  In fact it was very comforting.  I talked back to the shaman, but in my head.  I called it speaking to him telepathically.  I don't remember much about our conversation, but when I 'woke up' from the trance and opened my eyes I felt so happy.  I felt like I belonged in the world and I finally understood why I was here. I felt like I belonged in the world and I finally understood why I was here.  It was a wonderful feeling.
