After about an hour, we were sitting around chilling out, listening to music, attempting to talk, and it was really kicking in. When I closed my eyes I would tend to completely space out with hallucinations. For a while (it seemed like an eternity, but it actually couldn't have been more than 10 minutes), I kept picturing myself in this game show, with a bunch of flashing lights, which was quite pleasant. By this time my friend and I couldn't talk very much, we just sat listening to the music, occaisionally talking a little, and both of us completely spacing out for a few minutes at a time.
