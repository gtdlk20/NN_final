Generally - the key I think is the phrase 'slightly better'. My outlook on life - slightly better.  My depression - slightly better.  My self image/esteem - slightly better. My view towards my wife - slightly better.  My hope for the future - slightly better. My appreciation of beauty and the little things in life - slightly better.
