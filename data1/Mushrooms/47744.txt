Then I finally came to grips with everything.  I realized that I should just accept the shrooms, enjoy what they can bring, and wait till the wear off.  I watched Saturday Night Live, which definitely helped out.  Phil Hartman was the host and it was a very funny episode.  I didn't want to smoke any more weed yet.  I just chilled out and watched TV, but the visuals were still very present.  Then finally around 4:00 pm  I felt I was almost ready to drive and get something to eat.  But first I smoked, which only brought the visuals back, but I was no longer so disoriented and was in control completely.  So I drove even though I was still kind of seeing things, but I drove fine and driving seemed like a video game.  I got back and ate, but visuals were still present.
