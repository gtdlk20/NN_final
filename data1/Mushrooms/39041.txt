All this went on for 30mins - 1hour, then the energy I was feeling flow through my head took a steep incline over a period of about 5 minutes. What I thought was already a massive 'thing' communicating was dwarfed by something so HUGE that it felt like the universe itself or larger compared to an earth sized object before.  Both of these objects can only be described as being empty space, but they were somehow there, somehow occupied by something that was communicating with me.
