Kancer sat and beat-boxed, while I thought about myself and how I can better my life and the lives of those around me. I realized that I need to stop being so serious about pot, and LSD, and mushrooms and harmalines and whatever, and not be so spiritual about it all the time. I realized that I need to enjoy things more and have some fun. We soon decided to continue, right after a train crossed the bridge. We continued in silence until we got to the bridge and started to cross it. We slowly made our way across, stopping frequently to admire the water or the sky or the city stretching out before us. We eventually got to my house just a few blocks from the bridge, and it turned out the journey only took half an hour. We went downstairs and smoked out of my hookah and talked about all kinds of subjects while we listened to the 'Aqualung' album by Jethro Tull. Eventually, my girlfriend got home, at about 4:00 am, and we gave everyone else a ride home. Once we returned home we smoked a bunch of weed and listened to Jimi Hendrix's 'Are You Experienced?' album, before going to bed. I woke up the next day and began writing about what might have been the best trip I've ever had.
