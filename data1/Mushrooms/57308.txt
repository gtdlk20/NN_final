I wasn't hallucinating much with my eyes open, but when I closed my eyes I saw the most beautiful things.  It's so hard to describe.  I saw colors that could never be recreated in nature.  I saw strange visions like butterflies flying behind my eyelids with thousands of blinking eyes in their wings.  I remember being overwhelmed and wanting to cry with joy because it was so beautiful.
