My friend talked more, as I looked at him, he began to turn into glowing light. He was glowing the most brilliant light I had ever seen. I could see through him. His face looked like that of a pure angels. The air glowed around him. He was a shiny being glowing through eternity. The brilliance of it all cannot be equated into words.
