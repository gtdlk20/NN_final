Since we were now quite clearly tripping hard we decided to go to the Ship Wreak Coast tank. Along the path down to it there were more tanks. The first one virtually prevented us from moving as soon as we saw the Cuttlefish in there. It was hardly moving at all just hovering in mid water with its tentacles lowered down and its skin slowly changing colour. It looked so wise, like a shaman or wise man. It even seemed to have a human face with its tentacles being the beard.
