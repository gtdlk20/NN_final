We quickly rode our bikes to a store to buy some tarp so that we could lay on that without getting too dirty.  That took us 20 minutes, by now I was starting to get visuals and I knew that we needed to hurry to our destination before I got so bad that I couldn't ride my bike.  When we got to the entrance of the park, it was 8:15 or so.  This park is amazing, the ground is covered in moss and the trees are very 'spooky' on the flat ground.  By this time I couldn't ride my bike so we parked them and started to walk up the side of the hill.  This was very hard, the ground was mossy and moving like a ocean of algae.  When we walked up the side of the hill, I thought that I was floating and falling at the same time.  We finally reached our destination at 8:30, exactly one hour after our supper.  We laid out the tarp and laid down.  This time we didn't talk at all.  I don't know how long we laid there, I started to here bongos down by the river and people singing in japanese.  I closed my eyes and let myself drift away to teh abyss.  I started to get hallucinations like I never had before except my first time.  I saw only white with spinning colors and sounds of monkees screaching softly.  My visuals slowly changed into a large with room with fantastic translucent colors swirling and chasing around.  The monkees and bongos started getting louder.  I knew that it was time to leave the abyss before the sounds got out of control.
