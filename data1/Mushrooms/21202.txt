At some point I started to have a gastrointestinal disturbance in the form of some really bad gas pains. I remember rolling around on the couch dealing with that, hoping it would pass soon. I went to the bathroom and took a seat on the bowl. The gas pains became so great at one point that I thought I was going to pass out. This is something that has happened to me before on occasion throughout my life so I didnt really get too scared by it but it wasnt pleasant. I laid down on the floor so that I wouldnt fall down if I lost consciousness. Eventually the pain passed, I took a huge shit, and felt relieved.
