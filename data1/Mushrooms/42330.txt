I would like to now say what my intentions for this trip were.  I wanted to experience something completely mind blowing, something mystical.  I wanted to focus my attention on my theories and beliefs, to show myself that I am heading in the right direction with my ideas.  That is not exactly what happened.  I was disrespectful, and the moment one doesnt respect a substance, thats when one is in for a ride.  The house was open that weekend, so I had decided that I was doing something.  Originally, I was told that the shrooms were a no go, so I was thinking a high dose of dextromethorphan, or possibly a contemplative trip on 2-CI.  So, basically, I wanted that spiritual experience then, but that is why it didnt happen.
