I got up and attempted to empty the dishwasher. I took the plates out and put them up, and stopped to look at one, which seemed to have a peculiar alternate dimension to it that I could not access. I stopped emptying the dishwasher, because I could no longer deduce if the dishes were clean or not any longer. So I decided to stop the task. At one point I looked at the wall by the stairs which had a penciled picture of myself at seven or eight years of age. The picture appeared to float placidly and energy seemed to flow through it. At the time my mind was at complete peace.
