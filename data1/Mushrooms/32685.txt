About 10-15 minutes later I really felt like I was in another dimension. The walls started breathing, and the floor was kind of moving. My hands felt like they were stretching. I was not afraid, but very interested, and surprised that they kicked in so quickly. I decided now was a good time to call Lauren. I called her up and I think her aunt or a friend picked up. 'Lauren?' I said. 'Uhh no, hold on.' I heard her say that the phone was for Lauren, and it was someone who sounded very stoned. I found this very humorous.
