I can only describe what happened next as an open umbrella flipping inside out.  I realized that since my actions mattered so very little, I was essentially free.  I could do *anything* I wanted to, if I really wanted and was willing to deal with the consequences.  I could do whatever I wanted to with my life, and nothing anyone said would make me think otherwise.  Drinking water felt like I was filling my body with life.  Smoking cigarettes felt dirty, and I promptly quit.  We sat outside breathing in the fresh air, and I felt not only content but joyful.  The world is so simple and all the answers are right in front of our noses, and I realized it for the first time.  All you have to do is be.  Everything was beautiful and I was filled with love.  I wanted so much for everyone to be happy and feel the way I felt.  I had thought that it was part of my nature to be pessimistic and cynical.  Turns out, somewhere deep down, struggling to break free, is a love that I didn't know I was capable of.
