T+05:00ish - We reached W's house after many hours of distracted walking.  We looked at the clock and couldn't believe it was only 4:00am.  We had figured it must have been near sunrise!  We settled down in the living room, tired from much physical activity.  W put on a cd, Overnight Sensation by Frank Zappa, which somehow didn't impress me much more than it does when I'm sober.  I found I was able to tune out the cd and play a guitar beautifully, even though the guitar was bending and twisting and my fingers were growing and shrinking.  Somehow I managed to pluck the strings accurately and my mind was able to produce music of an unusually structured nature.  The other guys weren't paying attention, as they were busy spacing out on other things in the same manner.
