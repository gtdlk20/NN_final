We also found out that the lucky number for us was 3 bowls, after the 3rd one I felt a strange feeling, not like a high on pot, its closer to a hash high, but its still kinda of different, such as in my case I saw a radio tower with blinking lights, and when the light would blink it sent out rays in every direction of red light. Then I went and looked at the stars, and they seemed brighter and more real then usual, there was also a sort of pale redish green/blue halo around the sky and some of the brighter stars.
