Usually I like to keep my eyes closed because opening them makes me feel somewhat dizzy and nauseated, but this time I feel like I was able to get above the swirling and I emerged into this space of crystal clarity. The lights were dancing and Jimi Hendrix on the wall was a three dimensional mosaic doing his own undulating dance, but the previous swirling in my mental space was now totally still. I could see everything. It was like being a child, looking around at the room in wonder. The world was enchanted. I felt like I was in a crystal bubble outside of time. I thought I'd never need to blink again. Aldous Huxley came to mind: Now, this is how one should see!
