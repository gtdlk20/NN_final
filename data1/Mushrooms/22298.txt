I ran to the top but as I went over the crest I saw the neighborhood I was once a part of, I was in disbelief. THIS WAS NOT RIGHT. There was not supposed to be any sort of reality. And what a strange reality it was, street lights bent, cars flew through houses, stars fell.  I fell to the ground and wrapped myself in the blanket as reality started to rush back into my brain.  Reality came in waves the same way the effects of the mushrooms come in waves, as Beck said 'You just have to adapt.'  Jeff sat down next to me with the flashlight.  I buried myself inside the blanket and remembered this is where I had eaten mushrooms.  I remembered that before I began hallucinating it was day time, so I thought that the night time setting I was now in was just a hallucination.  I poked my head from the blanket and it was a strange orange dawn like place, it was night no longer.  But as quickly as it came it went, and I realized it really was night.  Jeff shined the light on me and it was comforting.  I took my arms out of the blanket and hugged my brother.
