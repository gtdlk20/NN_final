7:00-The start of the peak of my trip. The world was like some kind of circus. All I could hear was what sounded like clowns singing 'The mushrooms,The mushrooms,The mushrooms' over and over again. Almost in a mocking sort of tone. Cars looked like hideous monsters and trick or treaters looked like axe murderers and goblins. I was having a blast because I knew in my head that it was just the shrooms. The lights from the houses looked like I was in some kind of video game.
