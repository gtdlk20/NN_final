I personally recommend mushroom tea as my preferred method of ingestion. I've tried them fresh, dried, cooked, and in tea, and above all, tea is the best way to go. What you do is bring a cup of water to boil in a pot, then add the powdered shrooms. Turn the heat down to low and simmer for about 15 minutes. Stir the shrooms around as it steeps so the psilocybin and psilocin diffuse throughout the water. After 15 minutes, pour the mixture through a tea sieve to strain out the pulp (we like to call it the slurry). And what you have left is a steaming cup 'o goodness. Add sugar, honey and/or milk to taste and drink away. It doesn't taste too bad, although the color and smell may not win any awards. If you drink it on an empty stomach, it will hit you *fast*. In fact, when I first did 2 tsp of shrooms, I had major visuals in 10 minutes, and auditory hallucinations within 30 minutes. (After an hour, I met god...) The GI tract is much better at absorbing water than it is at digesting solids, so the effect is both immediate and powerful.
