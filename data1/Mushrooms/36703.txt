I finally recognized that these voices were really mayan gods; they sent me signs in the forms of visions of mayan cities and symbols that made me conclude this, there were thousands of them at a time that would tell me whatever.  These gods of the Mushroom decided to show me what I really was, they stripped me of the person I wanted to be and put me back as a baby, telling me to grow up again, I saw what I had been (living on the edge, drinking a lot, realizing I was comparatively lightweight now) and didn't like it too much, that's when I totally lost touch with myself.
