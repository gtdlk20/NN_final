Well, it was my birthday, April 8th.  I had started off the day doing volunteer work, let it be known my best friend had just gotten into a big car accident and was in the hospital, and my sister had told me she had a present for me.  After 5 hours of dodging cars and getting sunburnt, I went home.  There was a package, a square tin, filled with tiny mushrooms.
