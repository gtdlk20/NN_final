Oct 14  I forgot to write yesterday that I birthed the final cake of the original batch.   Theres not much else happening with the cake in the fruiting chambers, they are growing fuzz all over them, but thats about it.  Of the second batch, I have 10 more jars with growth, only one jar has yet to show growth, but Im sure its going to start soon.  Im starting a third batch of twelve jars today.
