I felt the strong urge to be alone. I told my SO I was going upstairs. I went up into the master bedroom, where no lights were on, and I layed on the end of the bed on my stomach. I felt like I was melting and I let myself wrap my arms around the side of the bed. I was relaxed now. The mushrooms intensified my self-talk, my thoughts were composed of what I should be thinking, and I was doing an exceptional job of keeping myself relaxed and levelheaded for the trip. This was the peak of the trip. Beside the bed and under me was a plastic bag. I had noticed it before tripping but it looked so different now. It appeared to me to have two faces, and to move slightly. Everything in the room looked so alive. The radio and its buttons shifted and morphed, and the face stared at me.
