As I laid there on the bed, with my eyes closed I was being shown beautiful fluorescent worlds, of different hues like reds, blues, purples and yellows. The imagery was mostly lined which formed amazing psychedelic visions. I couldnÂ’t believe the amount of visions I was getting. So strange and alien they were. I could tell I was seeing glimpses into possibly another dimension. The forms were always changing in imagery and colors. They were absolutely beautiful and felt very Sacred. This felt like total liberation for the spirit and it made me grin the whole time. I felt very grateful and thankful of the mushroom for letting me see into other realms of the universe. We rolled a couple joints that night of potent cannabis that we passed around and smoked.
