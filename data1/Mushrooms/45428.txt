The dose was a bit less than 10 grams wet weight. I chewed them up very well. They didn't taste bad. Kinda nutty with a bit of citrus. About 15 minutes later, much to my surprise, I started to throw up. I suppressed it and went for a walk in the back yard, but to no avail. In another 15 minutes I lost control and puked.
