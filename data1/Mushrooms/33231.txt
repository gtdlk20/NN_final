As for what I had heard of the valve of consciousness opening up  or any kind of positive enhancements or beauty  none at all  just dark ugly dismal and stupefying. It may be early days, but from that sample trip, I am discarding my mushroom growing interests for now. The stupefied and groggy effect made my mind up for me. I doubt that strong chemical is able to produce the lighter, clearer states I feel in heightened natural awareness. Quite the opposite. So I suppose in that sense its a useful negative contrast. It has got me thinking that I can do a lot more for myself with some regular meditation and Chi Gong.
