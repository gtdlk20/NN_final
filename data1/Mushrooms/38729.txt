 I heard whipped cream and Nick inhaling.  Then James inhaling.  Margo sat up and said 'Whats that?'  James gave her a balloon and said 'Here, inhale this.'  Margo said 'What is it?' and without waiting for an answer inhaled it.  She layed back down.  Then she looked at me and my balloon.  She stared and I could tell she wanted it.  'Thats the coolest balloon Ive ever seen.' She said.  'I know, but its mine.' I said.  Then everybody had a balloon.  Margo blew hers up and let it go, flying around the room.  We all became silent, even though I was on the brink of maniacal laughter.  I was still smiling uncontrollably and gnawing on the end of my balloon and squeezing my chair.  I took the balloon in both hands and squeezed it a little.  I was amazed by its resiliance.  Suddenly the rubber squeaked and everybody jumped.  I started laughing and apologizing profusely.
