I moved from the grass back to the stoop, where I met up with another group of friends, people whom I'd gone to high school with and with whom I was much closer. They wished me luck on my trip and made me feel more comfortable than the group I had been tripping with. I offered to smoke with them and they obliged, and we started back towards the construction site behind the residence hall. The third girl on mushrooms asked to join us, having been temporarily abandoned by her sitter. This ended up being a serious issue, as once we'd settled down to smoke she began to get angry phone calls from the sitters back on the stoop. One of my friends labeled it the 'phone of negativity', and from there I could see the girl start to get anxious. She demanded we go back to the front, but we were waiting for another person to arrive before we began smoking. Here's where things started to break down for me. Of the guys that I was there with, one, B, started to talk on meditative techniques in order to calm the girl down. B is a very spiritual person and has always intrigued me with his ideas on life. However, his talk started to freak out the tripping girl to the extent that she walked off, alone, towards the front.
