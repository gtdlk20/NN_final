We walked the few blocks to his house. I swear that the traffic and the rain and our footsteps and the sound of the leaves moving in the wind was in sync. Everything had a natural rhythm to it, and A noticed it too. Yeah, it was definitely the drug making everything seem that way, but it was beautiful. Everything conversed with each other in harmony, in music. We walked up the steps to his door and I turned around to see a small orange leaf waving goodbye to me from the tree outside his window. Of course, then I found that all the trees were waving goodbye when raindrops hit them.
