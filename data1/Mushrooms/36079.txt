This time, I had just a little bit of mushrooms left over from the previous experience. I estimate it to be around a half gram. I chewed it up around 6pm and held it in my mouth for a minute or so, then swallowed. They really don't taste all that bad, they certainly don't taste great, but theyre bearable. After dosing, I ate a bowl of soup with my mom and couldn't finish it even though I was pretty hungry prior to eating the shrooms. I told my mom I wasnt hungry anymore and headed upstairs to my room and put on some comfortable music.
