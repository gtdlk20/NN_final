Now a word about dosageI started my experiments with about 1.5 grams of dried shrooms (Psilocybe cubensis) and slowly worked my way up to my ideal: 2.2 grams.  I consume the shrooms in a tea approximately 45 minutes before class begins (to avoid digestive discomfort).  I take an amount that is just shy of what would give me light open-eyed visuals of the Persian carpet variety.  Once the open-eyed visuals start, I find the coordination and balance aspects of my practice too difficult.  Conversely, I find there is very little wiggle room between an optimal dosage and too low of a dose that barely benefits my practice at all.  I have been patient in experimenting, and the benefits from an optimal dosage have astounded me.  A good yoga/shroom day can make a struggling beginner yogi like me feel like I have just received a class from the Buddha himself.
