Eventually found our way back and found our friends. Talked a bit and wandered around the house. Went back to sleeping quarters and as effects were beginning to dwindle talked with companion and then had some of the best sex ever both of us agreed. Went to sleep feeling somewhat confused at all of the information gathered, but very satisfied and enlightened. One of the best nights ever and the positive effects are still with me everyday.
