We eventually came to a little basketball court, whereupon looking at the concrete floor, I saw intricate Roman mosaics all around. However, I was longing for the sweet feeling of fresh grass under my feet, and we walked to a nice big patch of grass in the middle of a little park. As I walked onto it, it suddenly lit up in a bright red glow, but I told myself that grass should be green, and it immediately changed to an amplified version of the beautiful, natural color that is grassy green. We found a nice spot in the shade and sat down to listen to some Grateful Dead. I noticed I'd sat down right next to a little slug, and proceeded to look very closely at it and talk to it. While looking into the immense fractal landscape developing in its wrinkly skin, I complimented it on what a magnificent and gentle creature it was, before it told me I should focus on the music coming from my phone. I looked over to see 'Fire on the Mountain' emerge from my phone in pink, blue and purple clouds of synesthesia. W then told me to look over at the trees across the pond, and I did. Instead of regular sunlit trees, I saw Van Gogh-style paintings of the same trees, trembling and rippling as if I was seeing their reflection in the pond. Maybe I was? Maybe I was actually inside the world of pond reflections? After thinking long and hard about it for about 2 minutes, I remembered that it didn't matter, and that I should just marvel at the immense beauty in this psychedelic landscape I'd been introduced to. W told me we should walk the long way back, so I said goodbye to the slug, and we started walking along the road.
