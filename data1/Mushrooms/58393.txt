I am close, but I have slipped here unperceived. Insinuated myself into this. And my mind and the mushrooms conspire to send me a message, for my notebook, for my gun: Man was not Â–I was not-- born for impotent rage, to be emasculated by a dull Mormon wife and the courts that see men as perpetrators and deadbeats. I am here goat-eyed watching this as-yet-not-martyred buck slope to the water like a streambank, exactly like a buck drinking while the world and its inverse pivot around his velvet nose and his crown rhymes with the trees. I am here to think clearly about what I can barely engage, and to make a big decision.
