As luck would have it, the South African rugby team was introduced by an African tribal chanting choir, whose harmonious thrumming sounds drew me in in a way that few other types of music could have done at that moment. As the voices washed over me, visions of faces the colour of ebony floated before me and morphed into infinitely long, wide ribbons, intertwining and shimmering from blue to red to purple to yellow.
