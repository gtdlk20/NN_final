I tried the shrooms a couple times taking only a fraction of a gram each time just to be safe. Each time I was given a sense of clarity.  I would turn of my light and stare up at the ceiling and get light visuals. The easiest way to describe these visuals would be 'like looking at TV static with 3D glasses on'. Not because the static looked 3D, which it didn't, but because the static was all red and blue like 3D glasses.
