After about an hour of waiting and feeling nothing, we started to become disappointed and doubt that anything would happen. However, about an hour later, sometime between 12:30am to 1:00am, I noticed I had lost interest in what was on the television and had been admiring the shape and architecture in the moldings on Dees wall. Dees family is a seemingly wealthy family and it was shown vividly in the beauty of this molding. The molding was pure white on a light brown painted wall and zigzagged in a stair like pattern across the entire length of the room. The room was dark and unilluminated and the shadows that the television light was creating on the wall from the molding danced in a pattern that was familiar, yet as I was seeing it now it looked especially beautiful, I couldnt take my eyes off it.
