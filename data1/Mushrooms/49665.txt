We went for a wander at that point, because I get urges to do that. Greendaves house has wallpaper straight out of the 60s and 70s so watching it on mushrooms can be seriously rewarding. The room we sat in had brown green orange and a beige-ish colour scheme of wallpaper with flowers. I was expecting some movement from them but all I got was the flash of a pattern in bright light every so often. Closed-eye visuals were more insane. They centred on what looked quite like the side angle of cartoon stairs, repeated infinitely, crossing each other and moving. Escalator-like in a sense. Colours were predominantly blue and red.
