I also felt very drained and had to lie down, and all the energy I had earlier just left me.  I also realized that my trip had almost completely gone.  Before J's panic attack or whatever it was, I was still tripping good, and after that it was just gone.  In my past experiences with mushrooms, I've never crashed, it just sort of wears off slowly until you go to sleep or whatever.  I wasn't upset that the trip was gone, but kind of relieved actually.  I felt like I made an incredible journey in just about 4 hours, and neither of us could believe it had only been that long since we first ate the mushrooms.
