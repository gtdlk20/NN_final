Whereas on the 2018 experience I basically fainted (completely dropped off) after the peak of the beautiful part of the trip, on the 2019 experience I stayed with the trip throughout.  There is one difference, however, which was that on the earlier trip I asked on that very peak of Cosmic fractal beauty: "Why, if there is such incredible potential for creation, am I still having to load the dishwasher?" The mushroom then decided to answer the initial question / intention going into the trip of: "Show me the beginning of creation". The colours disappeared, the room darkened, the mood dropped to below 0 degrees Kelvin.  The beginning was about to be shown to me and it was clearly a state in a realm opposite to the explosion of colour and light.  The beginning of life is a seed lying in total darkness, underground, waiting for rain to fall and for the temperature of the soil to increase before it struggles its way up towards the surface, into the light, to grow and bloom and become a magnificent flower, plant or tree.
