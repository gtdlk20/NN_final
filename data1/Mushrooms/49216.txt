I couldn't talk to my brother about it...he was completely sober and playing video games..I tried calling friends, but I couldn't even say anything to them....I told my parents I felt crappy and went to my old room and laid down in the dark. I don't know how long I lay on my bed, but it was probably at the worst part of the trip. I would lay there, kicking and punching the bed and gripping the sheets with white knuckles as the emotional, mental, and physical pain swept over me. I cried for the first time in many, many years, and I didn't even know why I was crying. I had nothing. NOTHING. I had no identity, no family, no friends...there was no good in the world, no good in my life, only darkness and emptiness. I can't express to any of you in any sort of language the extent of this feeling, nor can I express how terrible it really was. I doubt many have felt this pure feeling of despair before, and I hope that none do in the future.
