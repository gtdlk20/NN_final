Conclusions:  Smoking pure Psilocybin felt very much like I've heard people describe DMT, with a slower comeup.  Although my dose was definitely too high, I have gained from it even more than from a normal trip.  That reminds me:  Has anyone ever noticed how the real realizations only come in the part after the trip?  How would it be to take only very low doses of shrooms every few hours for a few days?
