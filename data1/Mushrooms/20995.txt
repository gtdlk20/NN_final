What I refer to below as "the medicine" was 3.1g of Psilocybe cubensis prepared as a drink with cacao and honey. I drank about 90% of it, got a strong intuition that that was the right amount, and stopped. I watered down the rest and took it as several microdoses over the next few days. (See "Coming home to waking life" below.)
