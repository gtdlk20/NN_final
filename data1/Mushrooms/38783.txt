Finally, at the peak, I experienced a particularly interesting effect. While looking at van gogh's self-portrait displaying his bandaged ear, I felt a very strong empathetic bond with it. It felt like his spirit was preserved in the painting, and was projecting to me a powerful sadness. Not entirely unfamiliar (I have had problems with depression), not entirely unpleasant, it did remove the previous euphoric feeling. In retrospect, I would put it down in the 'positive effects' column, but it was disturbingly intense.
