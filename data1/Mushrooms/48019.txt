Once we reached J's things continued in a similar fashion for a while before the trip dropped us sharply back to earth. We felt drained in every sense, physically and emotionally. The trip itself had lasted 6 hours although to us it could have been half an hour or a number of days. We retired to a bedroom and our separate beds and began watching T.V. we were still experiencing residual effects including a clouding of the thoughts. At this point I also started to experience decidedly painful stomach cramps this could be put down to the fact that all we had eaten in the past two days were magic mushrooms. We had little food in the house and so set to devouring a multipack of crisps (chips in the US). After about two hours my stomach cramps became unbearable and I took a paracetamol. Soon I was vomiting violently despite a lack of food to vomit.
