I had to pay $40 for a half a quarter ounce, which seemed a little steep to me, but I wanted to get messed up at camp.  Interestingly enough I went to pick up my bag of mushrooms in my old elementary school parkinglot. The caps were surprisingly small, and a beatuful golden color.  In the times I have experienced psilocybin before, it was with Psilocybe Cubensis, so I was a little bit suspicious of the way these blue meanies looked.  The smell is unmistakeable, however and I was happy to have these in my possesion.
