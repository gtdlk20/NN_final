Even though I had a bad trip, I didn't mind.  I learned a lot about myself from it, and I'm still planning to do them again soon. [In a week, in fact.]  What I love is the fact that since so many people were tripping and so many different things happened, everyone has a different perspective and story to tell.  That's how you need to look at bad trips though - as lessons learned, and not just as bad trips.
