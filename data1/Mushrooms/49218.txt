Eventually I made it through after a shower and some tea...and I felt.....very strange. I felt as if I had survived a disaster...like I had died and been reborn. As I came down from the trip, all the values in my life gradually began to be restored, but these values were now much higher than they were before the trip. Maybe it was because I had a whole new appreciation for them. Anyways, I felt sooo relieved, and had a great talk with my mom about things I had been wanting to talk about, (family junk) and with my brother. It was like I was finally doing the things I always wanted to do, because I had a sort of near death experience. I felt a new found love for life and everything in it, as well a whole new appreciation for my own life.
