I guess its called Philosophers Stone, because it makes me feel reflective, not recreative with the giggling and wanting to act stupid and all that. I think its good for (seemingly) deep talk. But maybe all this is because my mind set was leaning towards the pondering, the problem solving, than towards hedonism and mindless fun.
