We drove out to the coast after he finished his morning class (around 11am) and parked on the cliff. There were more people out than I was expecting. We hiked down a trail to a little old abandoned schoolhouse and ate the shrooms there at the picnic table: 1.98g each, him a big cap, me a fat stem like a twig, on empty stomachs. He didnÂ’t think it tasted too bad, and we washed it down with some orange juice. I was excited to show him the real deal, not just the little taste we had had on his first trip. Then we hiked down the trail to the creek and clambered over fallen redwoods and boulders to make our way up the creek bed to get away from any other hikers. We spread out a big blanket and opened a beer and poked around the creek a bit while we waited for it to come on.
