It was a normal Saturday and we hung out at his house for a little while until his parents left.  When they did leave we went downstairs and made ourselves some peanut butter and shrooms sandwhiches.  We munched down happily as we went back upstairs into his older brother J's room to trip.  Since I'm a good 40 lbs. lighter than P I felt the effects sooner than he did.  At first it was a slight tingling in my hands that pulsed through my spine.  Thankfully we took some Dramamine before the shrooms so I didn't feel that sick.  As the body trip became more powerful I felt my mind and body clinging to reality.  I quickly laid down on the bed and let everything flow through myself.
