I slowly come back to a near reality.  I hear sounds in the room, they don't sound good. I open my eyes to see my partner purging into her safety bucket, she is feeling rough. I rush to care for her, fresh water, fresh shirt, and a cleaning of the bucket.  There are so many swelled mushrooms in that bucket.  The cats run frantically about the bathroom, sure I am insane.
