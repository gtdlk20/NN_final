Oct. 1  I still have ten jars with growth.  There is still no sign of contamination in any of the jars.  By my inexperienced guess work, I would say that there are 4 jars that could be ready for the terrarium within 5-10 days.  All but one of the jars with growth has shrunk dramatically.   Ive decided in the last couple of days that it would be easy for me to expand this experiment from 12 jars to 48.  Ive made all necessary calculations and it will cost me an additional $149.88 to expand my operation by four fold.  Ive begun gathering the additional supplies and sent the order in for 10 syringes and to more spore prints so I dont have to wait for the first flush to start the new jars.  Two new strains will be added to the mix, Tasmanian and PES Hawaiian.  Both of these strains are supposed to be very fast colonizers as well as abundant fruiters.  The stated colonization time for the Tasmanian for ½ pint jars is 13 days.  I dont think Ill be able to get the jars colonized that fast, but it will be a little faster I hope.  Ive come to the conclusion that the strains I have now colonize better at higher air temps inside there box so I have begun trying to keep the temp between 84-88.  Everyday I become more and more proud of this experiment.  This is going to be a BIG success.
