I got up and asked Muse to call Kid A. I talked with him on the phone for a few minutes, but I dont recall what was said. I remember he told me not to freak out, and Im pretty sure I told him that I can do whatever the hell I wanted. I then gave the phone back to Muse who told Kid A all about my mushroom trip. I went to go lay again on the floor, and bumped up against a cardboard box with my head. I touched the box with my hands, and in my confusion uttered, what the hell is this, is this a part of me or what, I dont get it. I believed that it was a part of my skull that I had never noticed having. But in the end, it was only a cardboard box.
