After this the weirdness of the trip started. The haunted walkways opened up and the first one we went to was called the Carn Evil. It was a carnival themed area that was full of weird things. The first thing I thought of when I saw the entrance was The Circus Circus in Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas. It was by far the trippiest place I've ever been in my life, And it happened to be when I was tripping. The first thing I saw when I walked in was a midget dressed as a clown riding a tricycle. There were also clowns with knives, and even someone walking like the girl from the exorcist. It seems like this would have scared us, but we were having the time of our life. We were laughing the whole time, and even turned around at the other end and walked back through. We kept saying to each other how awesome it was to trip there and agreed that it was the only way to go to an amusement park.
