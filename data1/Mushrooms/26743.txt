Â“This is an incredibly fascinating species. My god. Having been raised and brought up within its society has been an incredible experience. But that is what life is, an experience, it is pure, and continuous until death. Death ends the experience and takes the experiencer back to the all aware god. God is infinite. God is eternity. Eternity is not a concept understandable to human beings. We just can't. We name things simply because we try to quantify our own existence, try to explain why, try to give meaning to our seemingly dull lives. Life is not dull. Life is the greatest trip of them all, because it is so filled with experience. Life is pure experience.
