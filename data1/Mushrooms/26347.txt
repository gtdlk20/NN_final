1:00am - My girlfriend and I decided we were really tired and that a good nights sleep would feel really good so we returned to her room alone.  She was asleep quickly but my brain was still racing.  I spent 45 minutes chasing strobing lights around my eyes and my imagination was screaming at light speed.  I saw a porcupine shape and revolved it into a spiked ball and realized I was the ball and suddenly saw myself getting acupuncture in a doctor's office.  I shifted around unable to sleep.
