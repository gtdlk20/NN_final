I am certain that this amount of mushrooms could have some very serious side effects on some people. I would not recommend this dosage for most people. However, it was a fascinating experience and I did not have any lingering effects after a good nights sleep (the next night). I always remembered that I had taken mushrooms and that the world as I had previously known it would return. Toward the end of the trip, I did experience the feeling that the trip was over and I was now in a new world. This was probably the most uncanny part of it since I felt like the effects had worn off, but I was still in that world where the TV was all about me.
