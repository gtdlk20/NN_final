When we got back, I felt a small miracle!  It was good to be back in safe territory.  I was glad I hadn't had to confront anyone about trespassing.  I felt very drunk - we collapsed in plastic chairs and relaxed for a while.  We went in the house and spent some time in the dark, which was beautiful.  I decided to take a bath.  I turned on the hot water.  The lights haloed in rainbows.  I was coming down, but still had a ways to go.  I stepped into the tub and crouched down.
