It was about 9:30 p.m when I received a phone call from Trevor. My heart skipped a beat. He had found shrooms and was on his way to pick them up. After hanging up, I was consumed with a bittersweet symphony, bitter first, sweet later. Remember when I said that the weeks leading up to this event were filled with research? Well, I had promised myself that the next time I would do shrooms it would be while I was camping because after reading about a hundred reports, I had convinced myself that camping + shrooms = complete unison with nature. And that is exactly what I wanted. But on the other hand, we had found shrooms! I couldnÂ’t believe it. I was about to embark on a journey that had no boundaries. A journey that would cause me to be shifted and lifted. A journey that did not care if I started it in a forest or in my house, because little did I know, I had a one way ticket to complete and utter craziness.
