Anyhow, I checked our best known shroom field (a racecourse) expecting to come away with few, if any, mushrooms. For the first ten minutes, as expected, I found nothing. Then I found shroom heaven, about 30 clusters of shrooms, all close together so that they formed one giant cluster of well over 200 liberty caps. I went into a picking frenzy, but was still careful not to uproot the shrooms and I left about half the shrooms I found to let them grow for next time. With my unexpected psychedelic bounty, I went to a friend's house to start tripping.
