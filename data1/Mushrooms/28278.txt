10pm: driving down the road I'm lost in trains of thought, and as if a boulder hits me in the back of my head I finally understand the meaning of God and for the first time truly 100% believe in him. He is not God in a sense of a person, as many would believe, but God is an entity, and throughout uniform energy that flows throughout everything. He is the sun, he is happiness, everyday of the week, love, sadness, the life in all living creatures who roam this earth. Or at least this is what I believe.
