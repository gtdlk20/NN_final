My sense of hearing didn't seem to change at all during the whole session. My vision shifted back and forth between fairly clear perceptions of my surroundings in waking life and abstract visual interpretations of the music. When I saw my sitter, my bedroom wall, etc., they were familiar but distorted in space, as if my brain simply refused to do geometry right then. My sitter asked later whether the shifts had been correlated with opening or closing my eyes, and I don't know. My kinesthetic sense, even in relation to my eyelids, became confused early on and didn't come back until right at the end.

That is, each moment felt connected to the one before it, but I couldn't organize a series of moments into a timeline.
