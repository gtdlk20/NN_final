Eventually, I realised that not only we are all from the same family, but we are from the same family than plants, grass, rocks, and all the rest. We are all made from the same chemicals stuff, neutrons, protons... Evolution of species and reproduction from a same species is only transfers of molecules... We are all the same thing ! The 7 billion people we are, are the same person. We are all GOD. GOD is inside of all of us. And GOD is pure love. I don't know how the idea of God came to me, but it did, it was pure evidence.
