So basically, what we are thinking of as aliens are just highly evolved humans.  They can somehow speak across time and space, and in a mushroom trip we can too.  If you look at the world, He is right, we will destroy ourselves. The creature that ingests psilocybin seems to be reconstructed into the image of this 'Other.' That IS evolution, in human's case anyway.
