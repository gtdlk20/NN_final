After this I got out a lollypop, one of two Id brought because I love them while tripping. Unfortunately as I was eating it K asked me if I had another one which I told her yes but I wanted it for later. Unfortunately K wouldnt take no for an answer and immediately started asking can I have it, can I have it over and over again while backing me into a corner. Eventually under this pressure I surrendered my second and last lollypop. In my currant circumstance I had no clue how to deal with someone who wouldnt take no for an answer.
