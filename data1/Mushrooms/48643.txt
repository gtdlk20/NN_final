Before i go any further I'd like to add that my high dose experience was about a year ago, it was on 4 grams of mushrooms and 3 grams of Syrian rue, this experience was very frightening as I had never done such a dose. After that mistake I decided I needed to do alot of preparation before I did such dose again, and that i would do only a pure dose of mushrooms, without the maoi because the maoi seemed to bring a very serious trip that I don't think anyone should have to deal with unless they are very experienced. Mushrooms are nothing to toy with!! As I'd hope most of you know. well anyway onto the journey.
