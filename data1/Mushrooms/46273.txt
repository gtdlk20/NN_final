About halfway along the path things began to turn a little weird. Every animal in the tank had human faces on them. Whole schools of fish looked exactly the same. The same dull, blank and soul less face looking like they wouldnÂ’t hesitate to hurt us if they could. The Sharks looked like frankistines monster. They were ugly, dangerous but ultimately kind and misunderstood. It was strange what is by all logic harmless (the fish) seemed dangerous and although physically human was nothing like this on the inside, almost like a zombie. While the sharks which are dangerous were on my side.
