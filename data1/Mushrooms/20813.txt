After 40 or 50 minutes, I donÂ’t quite remember, I began to feel the onset characteristic of mushrooms. My experience with mushrooms was limited to two or three times, and at a low recreational dosage. My experiences with LSD, on the other hand, were quite numerous and at relatively high quantities. I felt confidently prepared with the familiarity of what to expect. At least with the five senses. I felt the familiar tingling, the anticipation of what was coming.
