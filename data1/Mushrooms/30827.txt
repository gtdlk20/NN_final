I truly had 'a blast' haha! I am more conscious than I have ever been in my life and I just needed a kick in the pants to get out of my self pitying slump. Yes I would do it again, yes it was scary. I never want to be there again, but I did the right thing. I got myself out, and I'm grateful for the mushrooms helping me to do so. Life is truly, truly beautiful.
