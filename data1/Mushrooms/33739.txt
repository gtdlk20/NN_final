As we continue to walk I understand that our journey has been both a literal and metaphorical one. A has shown me around the park and made me laugh. But he has also shown me what a good mushroom trip is about, and more importantly what a good life is about. The entire trip has been an illustration of the perks of each path. I saw the group of kids from our school, getting drunk and smoking weed. While they were probably having fun, ultimately their lives and choices are less satisfying. A has shown me a more grown-up, serious way of living, and at the time it is the one that I chose.
