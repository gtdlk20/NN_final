Well, just thought I'd drop a quick line about some experimentative tripping I've been doing lately.  I've always found mushrooms to be a sort of unlocking mechanism when it comes to developing personal ability, whether it be learning to do something new, or simply bettering my understanding of something.  Learning to skateboard for example; all the critical milestones were passed while on mushrooms.
