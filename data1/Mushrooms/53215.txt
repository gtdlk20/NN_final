When the CD came to an end, Orb was put on. It did not have the same effect on me as Meditative Music had had. By this time the peak of the trip was over, and the others started talking and playing with trip toys (ie. throwing them at me). By concentrating, I still tried to recreate the intensity of what I had just felt in the music, but with limited success.
