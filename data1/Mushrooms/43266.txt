So gimpy fails on his mission and forgets to tell us of the time however I am thankful as I stay in my desert island fighting with my pillows while conversing about the organisation of some fake university with my good friend Rocko. I am getting to know them both more than I knew them before. However as my high comes down I am realising something, I wasted my buzz. Both my friends are like ''whoa'' and ''wow'' while I am disgusted at myself for having wasted such a potential of a trip.
