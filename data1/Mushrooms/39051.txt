The answer was quite astonishing.  This alien intelligence that I was communicating with told me, using thought and visuals, that what we are thinking of as 'God' is really this universe sized alien life that I was communicating with.  The mushrooms are what opens the doors of communication and what REALLY governs us as a human species.  I was told that the mushroom use is to be a new religion. This battle between good: mushroom experience and evil: suppressor of the mushroom experience, is what we are thinking of as the Armageddon, or the 'holy war' that is said to happen in the End Of Days.  I was also told that the Government would suppress this religious belief at the consent of the vast majority population, for the government quest for world power depends on this suppression.  'He' assured me that every time there has been an opportunity to be saved, there was a small percentage that does get saved, the rest were always misled and worshiped the wrong god, each person believing strongly that he/she was worshiping the right god.  The minority religion has been the one saved during biblical times, generally being suppressed. I was then showed visions of men ruthlessly following the wrong leaders, visions of Hitler and his followers,  visions of Bush, and his war in Iraq.
