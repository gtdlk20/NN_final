I walked around in the small park in the back of the flamingo for 2 hours until I ran out of cigs. I was much calmer by this point and felt it was time for a shower when I got back to the room almost everyone was asleep except for M who kept asking me dumb questions like 'How was the shrooms?' 'Why were you freaking out man?' I felt like hitting him in the face and saying 'I had a bad trip thanks to you asshole!'
