I have not mustered the courage to go back there yet, but have had several sessions of a more moderate character after. The strange thing is, I get back in to that geometric universe every time. Even on low-end doses, then off course in a lesser, more manageable degree. But every time I have been able to enjoy and cope with it better and better, and the creatures seems to take less notice of me.
