At this point I remember bits and pieces. It was like I was diving through levels, perhaps layers of my mind. Many of these levels were levels of fear, possibilities, and realities. They seemed to make themselves apparent to me as a possible reality. I would briefly consider them, even experience that said fear. Then I would dismiss them with variant degrees of difficulty leading me to the next level or possible reality.
