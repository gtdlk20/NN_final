After half an hour I was having the best visuals of my life. Everything was really looking bright and beautiful, and things were moving, breathing, pulsing and flowing, especially complex patterns. If I focused on any object, like a T.V., it would breathe and morph, only slightly, but this hadnÂ’t occurred on my first trip. I also saw incredible sparkles and star patterns in my near periphery vision, often on white surfaces, which disappeared when I looked directly at them. Complex fractal patterns of bright shimmering colours were also visible, again often in my periphery vision. However the best visuals I got were from a patterned sleeping bag. The vine like pattern seemed to grow and move, like in the film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, where the flowery vine like pattern on the floor grows, except for me it never the left the sleeping bag, unlike in the film where it crawled up the walls. It was the coolest thing I have ever seen though.
