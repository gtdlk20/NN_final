Just as a comparison we tripped on the same mushrooms about a month later (approx the same dosage), but this time without smoking any.  I found that I couldn't get the same body high (even with the help of pot)as before.  The mushrooms began to kick in about 40-45 mins later, but up to that point was pretty boring (sitting around and waiting).
