Finally, I managed to sit down and relax and just sit and observe the changes that were taking place around me. Looking at the colors and textures of the paintings, fabrics and such that were around me gave the appearance that I was sitting in a giant, fantastic gem.  After a few hours, however, the variety of color and patterns became annoying and progressed to the point of being hideously offensive.  The garishness of every piece of furniture around me was like an assault to the senses, they were so intensified.  Unfortunately, the powerful oceanlike wave that was coursing through my body prevented me from being able to get up and walk. My speech was really slurred, and all sound and color seemed to be moving to the rythm of this wave.
