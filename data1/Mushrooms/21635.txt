I never told them about the mystical events that took place that night, fearing that they would think I was crazy and might do it again. My face hurt and I found out that my nose was slightly broken and I had a mild concussion. Dee was a large muscular person so I wasnt surprised about my injuries. I just wished I could have remembered him hitting me. When I got home I went to my room and just sat on my bed, still in disbelief. I began to cry because I was scared and didnt know how what happened to me was even possible. There are so many questions I have about that night that will never be answered. How were we able to understand each other when we were speaking over each other at the speeds we were? How were we able to know exactly what each other were thinking with out putting those thoughts into words? How did I know his mom was going to walk through the door just seconds before she did? Why did those thoughts of everyone being one come to me? I have read that the same thoughts happen to others under the influence of the substance. Could there be a message encrypted in the chemicals somehow?
