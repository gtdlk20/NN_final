There were tons of people in this room.  And with my man basically telling us the story of his life, plus many sub-stories, I felt like I didn't even have to talk.  That turned into me not really knowing that I could talk.  I didn't mind though, at that point I was contently observing everything around me.  People's hair changing pretty colors, faces flattening and expanding, eyeglasses waving on faces, people in pictures talking mutely to each other.  Soon I had no idea that I was a human.  I sat there occasionally giggling when I caught the eye of my tripping lover, just knowing he and I had this great connection at the moment.  It was almost an out of body experience, but I felt like I was a being just using this body to see things out of a human's eyes.  It was just unreal.
