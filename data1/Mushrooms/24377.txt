I was alone.  My grades were bad.  I was being so weird.  I could never be a good person.  Squeezing my eyes closed I sobbed without crying.  Desperation, I had to stop feeling this way.  I felt emotionally pained and feeling like I had screwed myself out of ever being a good person.  I had disappointed myself and countless others.  My stomach was in knots.  I tossed and turned.  A feeling of hopelessness surrounded and crashed on me like a wave.  I couldn't escape my faults coming down on me, one after another after another.  After another.  I sometimes wimpered 'Please stop, this has got to stop.'  This room had become my own awful prison cell.  I was scared and alone.
