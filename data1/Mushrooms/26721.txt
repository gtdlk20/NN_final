8:15 P.M.  Me and D smoked a cigarette and while on the patio of our dorm, a large expanse where we would all go to smoke, two people came to join us. They knew D and introduced themselves to me. One was a girl I had seen before, and something about her was off. I felt at times that I could sense something more then was shown to me visually and audibly - it wasnÂ’t paranoia, but a peace of mind, knowing that this girl hides so much from the world. All her pain is manifested in this strange behavior of masks. In fact, her face looked like a mask at this point, and I was certain of all the lies. Me and D parted and I went up to my room and turned on my computer. I sat there and the heat of my room began to increase the effects of the mushrooms. Time was pretty much meaningless at this point. I could look at a clock 10 times and have a million thoughts and ideas, and still, a minute had not passed. The time dilation was very intense. I went online and it was pretty difficult to read anything, as it swam around in my vision, so I decided to check out the visionary arts vault. The picture which was new that day was this: http://www.erowid.org/culture/show_image.php3?i=art/artists_e/erial_steeringtowardheaven.jpg  .
