Not accurate at all. Much easier with the eyes open. This will be so STUPID to read later... but its fun right now... which IS the point, isn't it? WHO DO I expect to judge me? Or do I judge myself,.. this is silly... but this is getting at something important I think I am understanding this whole trip thing now... it really lets you look at things in a straightforward way,... the music is fine... but the ability to type and to reflect on what is being thought is FACINATING!.................. I can't abstract too much. I feel this need to type evething.
