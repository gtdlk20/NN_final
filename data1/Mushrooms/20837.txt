I have to stress that as I go through the various perspectives that I experienced, it all happened simultaneously, all at once. I, me, he, she, it, us, them, you, wethese terms are useless in describing an experience with the One. I will refer to the various perspectives by their names to avoid the pronoun confusion. This lasted for roughly 3-4 hours. The dialogue I had between me and the entities was partially one sided as I could not discern anything other than a strange sound that emanated from the speakers. Me Lying on the Bed listening to The Inner Mes responses was how I was able to discern some of the dialogue. It should be noted that only Mothers voice was comprehensible to all my perspectives including Me Lying on the Bed. She also produced no words in my minds or verbally. I am still not quite sure how I understood her, maybe it was Heart language, since Truth is its own language.
