I went back upstairs to my room, and lay in bed. As I focused on my bedspread, I thought back to the very cool game experience and saw it play out faintly, but noticeably, on my bed. I could see the track form visually. It was a very pleasant experience. After this, I decided to draw to see if anything creative came out of it. Nothing really so much, so I moved on to gather any insights that may have popped up, as I heard mushrooms could help with this. I got out a piece of paper, and wrote down about 5 things that my mind told me in this place of peace and harmony.
