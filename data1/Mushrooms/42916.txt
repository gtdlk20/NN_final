Ive heard stories of brave souls tripping on airplane flights. Ive never really considered myself claustrophobic, but I dont think I would never be able to do that. Im sure if I could muster up the courage then itd be one hell of an experience though. Maybe thatll be my next idea for a book. I just feel like the very understanding that theres no escape if something did go wrong would be enough in and of itself to cause a disturbing trip. Thousands of feet above land isnt exactly an environment I would call relaxing, but thats just me.
