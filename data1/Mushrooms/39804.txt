T and I are relaxing listening to some music, making a plan to hike to the nearby park and go for a stroll.  I decide it would be a good idea to see how things turn out before making a public jaunt, so we decide to hang back for a little while in his apartment.  I'm beginning to get my first alerts that something is happening.
