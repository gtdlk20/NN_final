The first sign of the effects occurred within about five minutes. My left leg started twitching up and down, and then my right leg joined in. It was as if I stayed awake for several days while eating nothing but coffee beans or something. A lot of excitement in my lower body, mostly legs. Then we started to notice eyes in the wall, which were actually knotholes, but they all looked like eyes or faces. It was pretty cool, but not intense at all. Suddenly, I fell out of the chair, started laughing, groped my head and face, rolled around on the floor, grabbed things and tried to put them in my mouth, all at the same time. No visual hallucinations yet. As I was rolling on the floor, C gave A a tape recorder, so as to record his experience. I had an otherworldly feeling, and I couldn't stop laughing, but I could hear A talking into his tape recorder. 'So many dots,', he'd say. 'Look at this card, dude, it's a five of clubs and it's everywhere.'
