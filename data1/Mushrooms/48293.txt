I did all this quite quickly, and as I did, I felt very strange. Thoughts were screaming into my head to move faster, and try to remember everything. I did, so I was happy, and I went to bed. It was now midnight, and I felt a bit scared, because the shrooms seemed to be working again, and the colors had returned, and I had started to see things morph again. In the dark, it didn't look like much, but it freaked me out because it looked like things or people were moving around my room. So I turned the hall light on, and tried to go to sleep. I found it very difficult to try to go to sleep, and I felt very restless. I started tossing and turning. I eventually started talking to myself, and I felt like a genius.
