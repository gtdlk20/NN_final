I remember at one point looking up at one of those young athletes on the diving platform and remembering what it was like to be that age and have trained so long and hard for an event, and then feeling my body uncoil and do its thing, as a simple, fixed, action.  Then, I pushed off the wall and went into a beautiful and graceful butterfly.  I visualized myself swimming, with the peaks of the waves around me swirling in psychedelic oranges, yellows, and reds.
