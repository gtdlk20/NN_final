We woke up the next morning and Ace was able to tell me now, with more clarity, what he had experienced the previous night. He said that he had lost all identity and didn't know what his name was, where he was, if he was a man or woman, who he was with, etc. He told me I would have a very hard time getting him to try mushrooms again and he got rid of the rest of his stash pretty quickly after that. I quite enjoyed myself that evening, on the contrary, and have tripped 3 more times since then with great results. I've tried convincing him that he would have a better experience if he changed a few things from his first time such as, eating before taking the mushrooms, eating something WITH the mushrooms, being in a calm/ non-public setting, and not eating so much of the mushrooms. Lesson learned I guess.
