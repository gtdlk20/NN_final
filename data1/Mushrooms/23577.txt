I spent at least twenty minutes longer there, talking with the trees and occasionally with the deific force I had heard earlier.  They told me of the devastation wrought by the miners, of course, but they also explained many natural processes.  They showed me images of beings who directed the growth of the area, tall entities of colored light who walked easily throughout the land.  They were on a higher plane than other humans were, and that I was on in my altered state.  Theirs was farther from the physical -- too far to influence it directly -- though they could interact with the nature-spirits easily enough.  I learned much in that short time.
