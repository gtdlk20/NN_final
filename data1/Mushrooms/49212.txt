Funny enough, all this took place back at my parents house, which is a very positive environment for me. I have a very close and loving family, and when we all get together for the holidays, it's always a pleasure. My brother was around and so were my parents. I actually had to sit at the same table and eat dinner with them while trying to act sober during this horrible trip. Maybe it was partially because I had to hide the fact that I was tripping that my trip became so horrible...I don't really know...
