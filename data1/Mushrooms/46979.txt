As I looked out the windows at the surrounding trees and plants I began to feel a vast amount of appreciation for them.  I was both ecstatic and amazed that something like a tree could exist.  Just the fact that it was there was like the greatest thing ever.  I looked to my left and began admiring the dumpster that was there.  It was a plain, brown, garbage dumpster.  But I noticed all the little scratches, nicks, and marks on it.  I started to wonder 'How did each individual scratch get there? And what was the person who put it there like?'  I began imagining the people who could've done that, and I was fascinated by them.  This wasn't represented visually at all, but rather on a more subconscious level.  Kind of like daydreaming I think.
