At about 2 hours I felt peak effects start.  A type of anxious anxiety was present as feelings of returning home again, back to this special isolated world somewhere not yet discovered by most people.  Everything appeared to be staring back at me.  I went outside to smoke again and the clouds seemed to form faces in the wind.  The trees seemed to be trying to grab me with their branches. They appeared to be somewhat more life like as the branches appeared as arms, the leaves as hair, and a face forming on the trunk. These visions were amazing. The mushrooms seem to bring out the living spirit from everything around.   Sounds become apparent during this time also as very subtle voices were present, but there source unknown. The sounds aren't really able to be described in words, some sort of vibration going through your head. After smoking, we all listened to the beatles. As I sat on the couch, I felt like I was sinking into the cushions.  Kinda like the couch was flowing around my body.  Music was a very important factor for this experience with mushrooms. Songs involving keyboards or mood synthesizers, or even good light guitar playing were perfect choices.  Made the mood more pleasant.
