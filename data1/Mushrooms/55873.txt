My other experiences were with the irish liberty caps, of which I would take about 100 each time. The trip continued from before and this time I found the life path of me and some other people I know and followed it into the longterm future. I could not see incidents of the future but I knew who I would still be friends with, who would take a different path and I also got a glimpse of some of the more influential people I am to meet. I have no real expectations of any of this to come true but I would not be surprised if it does. I will go into more detail on all of this some other time. At the moment I am cultivating some mexican mushrooms in my home. They will be all ready in about a week and I look foreward to the next revelations of the map of life.
