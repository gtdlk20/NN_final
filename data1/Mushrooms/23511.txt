I lay on Dave's bed, and observed the smoke from the incense for a long time. It was beautiful and fragrant, and it seemed to continue forming mushrooms, resembling liberty caps, with the symbol for infinity near the base of the edge of the gills. I murmured that I saw mushrooms in the smoke, and Dave laughed a little. I was content with watching the incense burn, and did so for some time. Yon was fairly high, and said very little. By the look on his face, he was enjoying himself. The vibes from these friends were excellent, and I allowed my mind to wander, as I waited through the come-up.
