I also saw many other things that night, including one that really spooked me for a minute. I walked to the livingroom to turn on the heater, when suddenly the couch stetched out of proportion and I had the crazy idea that it would tear open and my parents would've killed me when they came home on monday. I leaped onto the couch screaming 'Remember the Alamo!!' in a very intense manner. But fuck, I was a man on a mission. ;-)
