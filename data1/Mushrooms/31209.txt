Stage 4.  The three of us had all decided to lay down in this really random vacant cement lot in the middle of our neighborhood. I started to get these really fucked up ideas of religious views and meanings of life, and I grew to hate mother nature. I had convicted her of being the devil and I was paranoid that she had tricked me into eating the shrooms, using them as her home-grown vessels to my brain where she'd steal my infinite knowledge so that I would be like the rest of all the human beings. So for about 20 minutes long I was engaged in combat with her in my own head. I went into convulsions, my limbs throwing themselves all around the lot, my body contorting itself in ways unimaginable, i was crying and laughing at the same time, repeating over and over, 'I won't let you win, you fucking bitch.' I was going through emotional warfare, rolling all over the place, slamming my fists down and trying to regain stability. After I felt I had won... I flipped over onto my back... opened my eyes, and took a deep, long breath. I looked up at the sky, pink clouds were swiftly rolling in over the navy blue night sky. It almost felt as if it was a sign... the clouds being my force overpowering hers... For the next 30 minutes, everything anyone said to me, or anything I did, I was bold. Jess would offer me a cigar and I'd tell her that she was working for mother nature and was trying to infuriate me by offering me stuff, as if I couldn't do it on my own. I told her I was disgusted by her and that I didn't need her pathetic bullshit. I was God. I then climbed into Jess's car and locked the doors, claiming it as mine and NOT mother natures. I said I would use the car as a steel shell to contain my thoughts and my energy, so that I could fight against her once again.
