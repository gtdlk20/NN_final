When I made my first spore syringe, I used a spore print about an inch across and added 50 ml of water.  I filled one 14ml syringe (that's all I had) and inoculated a set of ten jars.  The result was INCREDIBLE! The jars showed hard-to-see signs of germination on the third day.  Within 24 hours of this, however, the jars EXPLODED with growth in each of the quadrants.  These were big spots the size of a quarter or more in 24 hours! Many of the jars colonized fully within seven days after germination.  I lost only one jar to contamination, and this was because I was storing the jars next to something that I later discovered was molding.  I did not use an aquarium to keep the jars at exactly 86F like the first time, yet the germination and mycelium growth was MUCH faster than the when inoculating with spore syringes PF sent me.  I assume this is because my solution was so much more concentrated and fresh than the one they sold me.
