When we were coming down and started to go through our experiences my friend told me that he had dissolved into everything, but my little rules to remind myself where I was helped him too. He had the feeling that those things had kept him from dying and he was glad I did it because that way he felt that he had stayed sane. We also had the same visuals from the concert like the young Robert Fripp and some closed eyes visuals were the same although the form was different (he saw coloured visuals, I experienced being there and knowing where I was with an absence of colour or form) the essence was the same.
