After a time I heard my mother come home, this was expected, and I perceived it to be a problem I would have to deal with. My heart pounded and my mind shifted through thousands of thoughts. This began the bad part of my trip. I turned off my music player, and turned on HBO to Antz, which I found considerably unentertaining. She yelled down that she had gotten me a cake for my birthday, and all I could say was 'cool'. Feeling immense guilt for not thanking her. Then she either yelled down that I could have a piece or something about the vomit in the hall. I presumed it was the former and not the latter, and invited her to cake. She replied 'No that's just weird.' I began to panic.
