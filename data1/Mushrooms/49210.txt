Happiness in life is measured in the values which we hold dear, correct? This means family, friends, hobbies, the world around us, everything that is positive in our lives that drives us to keep on living. Well all these things, everything that gave me a reason to live, were RIPPED from me. They were taken away, and I could not find the reasons why I was living. I believe I felt the purest form of despair...I was feeling horrible physically, emotionally, and mentally, and I was depressed to an extreme I have never felt before...I was trapped in this hellish spiral, falling down down down to a bottomless abyss from which I couldn't escape.
