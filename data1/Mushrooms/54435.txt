I came up with a proposal to get out of the Hell of the eternal loop; to go into the fractal, so to speak, into a dream, an illusion, of normal life.  To embrace the simulation, to refract the Self so that it can forget what it is and possibly never find out again.  To be allowed to close my eyes, go to sleep and wake up the next morning, blissfully unaware of the torture awaiting in that zenith of truth, the pinnacle of logic.
