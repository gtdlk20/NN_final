Around this time, perhaps 40 minutes into my trip, I started to fully experience everything around me.  I sat down in a chair, and noticed that my arms and legs were no longer controlled by me unless I fully concentrated on moving them.  My arms, which I could only describe as being possessed, would occasionally crawl up and down my chest and wander around my face.  I honestly could not tell what they were trying to accomplish.  I had visions of them wanting to strangle me, but I wasn't worried about that happening.  It was quite amusing actually, and I got quite a kick out of watching my arms wander around like lost puppies.
