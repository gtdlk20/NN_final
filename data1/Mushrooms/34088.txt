After that I blacked out. Which I didn't realize until what I am roughly guessing to be two minutes later when I woke up jammed between my bed and my nightstand. I no longer had any urge to vomit. I got off the flour and climbed into bed. This is when things got really painful. The easiest way for me to explain what I was feeling as I layed in my bed was a Black Hole of my mind. Everything; my senses, my memories, my emotions, my thoughts, were all just melting together in a puddle of mud that was my life. Everything I saw was beautiful and colorful, but in my mind was the single most painful experience of my life. Random thoughts and memories. All my thoughts were in the voice of Johnny Depp as Hunter Thompson from the movie.
