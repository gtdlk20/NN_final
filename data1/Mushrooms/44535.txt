As is generally the case with exercise, the trip was pretty short and by 3:00 I was landing.  My theory is that hard work increases total cardiac output, meaning that more blood will be filtered through the kidneys and the liver.  However, it was an amazing experience, and I hope that I will be able to experience it again one day.
