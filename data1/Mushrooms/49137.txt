I took about five grams of shrooms then chopped them up into almost a powder. I then boiled them in water for about ten minutes, added some tea flavoring, and funneled it all into a one liter soda bottle. When we got to Bonnaroo I filled a cup with ice and poured the one liter bottle into the cup (yes, I made cold tea, it was VERY hot).
