Often when mushrooms first start kicking in, I find myself unable to keep my eyes open. So I went into the bedroom and laid down. I closed my eyes and fell into a world where I was no longer anything but an entity. I felt like I could go anywhere and understand everything. I was not sure if I would be able to get back to the real world or not, but that didnÂ’t worry me much. I had decided that I would completely give in to the experience and not be afraid. I traveled around in this world for a while (seemed like a lifetime), maybe 20 minutes. I then realized that the beer was making me have to pee, so I entered a kind of elevator and arrived back in my bedroom.
