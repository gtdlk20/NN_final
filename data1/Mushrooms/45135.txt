Wave after wave keeps hitting me, each time I feel out of breathe and overwhelmed. After an hour or so D tells me to come outside. I feel as if there is a line seperating my body. I look out and cars are splitting and I am getting very intense visuals. I tell D to give me his jacket, but can't figure out how to put it on. I see a man riding a bike and think its security and decide to walk back in. BOOM!
