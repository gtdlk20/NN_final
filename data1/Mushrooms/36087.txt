Overall, I was shocked at how much of a trip I got from only about a half gram. The lessons I learned on this trip I still carry with me (2 months later), and I now am always careful to thank people when they are friendly and nice. I also try to be more kind to other people, and most of all, I don't take anything for granted anymore. When I sit down to the dinner table and look at the wonderful meal I have in front of me, I am *truly* grateful. These mushrooms really changed my outlook on life.
