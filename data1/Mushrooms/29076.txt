Eventually everyone else returned back from the festival, and they asked what the hell had happened to me earlier. I told them how I ended up eating 6.5 grams in total, and there was no way I could have ever made it to the festival with that kind of dose. They had an amazing trip on their own at the festival, which I was glad to hear. Though I was also somewhat sad that I missed out on it, especially because I had missed a band that I really wanted to hear.
