I had tried mushrooms once before when I was 16, buying them from a guy I knew from school. The effects were light and gave slight eye-play, but mostly just euphoria. Having exsperienced many diffrent types of drugs in my past (from huffing gas to exotic opium to crappy bags of weed secretly laced with crack, dust, exc.) but non phycodelic (besides the angeldust that I did not know was there), I found I really liked mushrooms and would like to try them again, but didn't for a while.
