I was keeled over the side dry heaving into the snow. Now right about this moment, I was at absolute rock bottom. In fact, I was concerned that I had just lost my dose when I remembered that I was tripping, so at least it had not gone to waste. Eventually T put some headphones on me and played some goood music (Death From Above). This relaxed me and I closed my eyes and listened to the tunes. I tried so hard to collect my thoughts and turn my trip around. The headphones started to piss me off so I took them off. My body temperature was just all over the map. One minute I would be shivering and the next I would be absolutely on fire. I had no idea how I was going to survive and I remember wishing to myself this would all be over.
