Walking seemed to get us out of the depths of the trip. While it was difficult to focus on anything, we made it back safely. There was a group of kids in front of us that suddenly disappeared, but that's the norm for a Reno tripper. We entered our casino with the single-minded goal of getting to our room. It had been two hours and we needed someplace quiet to relax. The wax-faced casino clientele were getting in my way, but we finally found an elevator. Someone said something to me, and I mumbled some sort of response. Neither dude nor I remember what I said. I hope it gave someone an entertaining thought to ponder. When we stepped out of the elevator, I had two revelations. We weren't in the right place, and the carpet is moving...a lot. It was my fear and loathing moment, and I basked in it for a few minutes, wandering down the hallways and staring at the floor. Since we had apparently jumped into the wrong elevator, we went back down and I was lucky enough to have a fellow resident speak to me again. Same result.
