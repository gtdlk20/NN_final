I experience terrible headaches of the migraine sort.  The only type of headache i have ever had are migraines.  I often pop my neck and back to relieve tension.  I find when i am on mushrooms that i am very easily able to pop my neck several times in each direction without any pain at all.  I'm not really sure this has much to do with anything, but I figure for research purposes, anything helps.  I will definitely keep track of my frequency of headaches since i have used mushrooms.
