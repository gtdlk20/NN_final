Suddenly it was night, my brother told me to get up because we had to go find our friends.  During the sunset, which I do not remember except for yelps of coyotes and reverberating auditory hallucinations, I had somehow come to terms with the fact that what I thought to be reality was not real, and I was strangely OK with that.  I ran from Jeff thinking he was make-believe and I felt a rush of flight and saw everything around me bend and melt.  Suddenly I saw a flash of light as Jeff beckoned me back.  He was holding a light, the light felt and looked real so I went to it, I told him the light was real.  I then grabbed him as he was franticly cleaning up and hugged him because I realized he was my brother Jeff, and I told him this, he reassured me who he was.  We began walking up the hill but I was freezing, I somehow had the blanket and wrapped it around me. Jeff had wanted me to help him carry backpacks and our gear but I still believed it all to be fake, and refused to carry it.  I feel bad but Jeff managed to carry everything.  He was still very understanding of the state I was in and willing to help me.  We walked up the hill as trees melted and bent around me, Jeff and the light the only stationary figures of reality.
