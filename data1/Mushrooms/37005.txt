After about an hour, I wasnt feeling much of anything except drunkenness. I was just dizzy and numb. Hank told me it would help if I went for a walk and got the blood flowing, so the whole gang of us headed out across campus at night. I was quickly overcome with an intense feeling of happiness. I couldnt stop smiling, no matter how hard I tried, and I would laugh loud and hysterically at virtually anything. I still wasnt getting any visuals though, which kind of had me disappointed. I would soon learn that patience pays off.
