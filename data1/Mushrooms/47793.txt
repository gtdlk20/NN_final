This keeps going for a while, and gets more and more intense the further I go. I often see a little bundle of shrooms down by the horizon. They start off really tiny, but start spinning faster and faster as they get closer and closer to my face. As they pass through my face, my face turns into a cartoon character face and starts chasing after them. When it finally catches and eats the mushrooms its pupil's get huge and it slaps back on to my normal face. By now I'm thinking I ate poisonous mushrooms and I'm going to die. It's the only way I can explain why I was tripping so hard. This was just some paranoia seeing as how I never really tripped before that (not hard anyway) and it was kinda scary having that intense of a trip.
