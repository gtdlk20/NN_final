Lost in the beachhead of the internal wilderness. I am we fragmenting into split screen basalt stone monoliths and the point horizon. The Zen-infused reckless light of imploding darkness. I am disinterring the blue coins at midnight. Pooling in the endless titanic wonder of incandescence. Reconstituting and deconstituting reflux flux swirling vortex of the late period of now.
