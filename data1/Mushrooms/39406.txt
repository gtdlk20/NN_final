The other introspection that I had during this experience is a bit more personal, and thus, perhaps not as relevant to other people, but I'll toss it out anyway.  Basically, I've been feeling unhappy lately, and doing things that I know will make me more unhappy with what seems like intentionality.  I have been searching for a reason for this deviance, and it dawned on me that all any parent really wants is to see their children grow up to lead happy lives, and my clinging to my dark side may be some of the last vestiges of my teenage rebeliousness making themselves manifest.
