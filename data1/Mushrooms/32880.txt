Well, it all started at night when I decided we should get some mushrooms around 3AM, drunk. The only connect we found was someone about 40 minutes away and ended up getting them and sleep about 5AM. Eleven grams of powdered crushed up boomers. Woke up the next day with a few things to do, so me and the two other trippers went our separate ways until around three PM. Before leaving I wrote down a few things I had been thinking about lately that I wanted to keep in my mind, if somehow it changed on the trip.
