I had tried magic mushrooms twice before, but hadn't reacted as expected in the past.  The first time I ate a very small amount, maybe less than a half-eighth, and felt nearly nothing other than a bit of a floaty sensation, as if there were another world out there and I could barely comprehend its possibility.  My guide and I then smoked a bowl of some pot and that overrode whatever mushroom effects I nearly felt.
