Anyways, we got to the store and got the drinks we needed, quickly making our way back to the dorms to start drinking. My memory of that night is hazy to say the least, so Im limited on how many details I have to share with you now. But I do remember we all drank and wondered from room to room around the residence hall for several hours before we got to the main event of the evening. If I had to guess, I would say that the first joint came at around nine oclock. I remember I was already extremely intoxicated, and Evan and I had stopped back into our room for a brief second. I asked him what he thought about the drugs, but as I recall he was strictly against it. I didnt want to miss out though, and hurried out of our room down to Peters, passing a window and seeing him, Zulian, and a few others already outside. Irritated that they werent even willing to wait for me, I raced down the rest of the stairs as fast as I could and out the back doors, joining everyone in a circle.
