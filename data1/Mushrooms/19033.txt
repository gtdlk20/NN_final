I consider myself highly experienced with psychedelic substances. I have done acid and mushrooms probably a couple hundred times each, as well as experimenting extensively with hallucinogenic offerings of the botanical world, and several of the more commonly available chemicals discussed in PIHKAL and TIHKAL. I am also no stranger to high doses.
