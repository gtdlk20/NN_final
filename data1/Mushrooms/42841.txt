Nevertheless, I still feel like maybe I should have limited my drug use from the start, but I guess its too late for that now. Ive been able to maintain control on everything else, even opiates. But marijuana has always been a weakness, ever since that first weekend I tried it. It seemed to unlock visions within me of a perfect world. I felt like my mind had been shattered; like everything I had been taught to know up to that point in my life was a lie.
