We planned it one Saturday night when we had arranged to go out in a group of about ten people with our girlfriends. We had a normal evening drinking beer, but towards the end of the it somebody suggested that we all go on to the local Indian restaurant when the pub closed. Pete and I declined the offer but suggested that the girls go on and enjoy the meal whilst we had our own special meal :).
