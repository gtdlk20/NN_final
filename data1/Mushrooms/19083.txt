When I got back in, I tried to get comfortable again. I tried putting my socks back on, finding them sweaty and kind of smelly. It was as if my feet had swollen, and try as I might I could not get my socks back on. I decided I should get a nice, new pair of socks for the journey, so I let myself out of the room again, this time heading to the end of the hall to the bedroom Miel and I were sleeping in.
