A explains to me the previous time he was on mushrooms, he was in his friend's basement standing between Person B and Person C. Person B is a cool guy, but his life is basically centered around going to parties, getting drunk, and selling drugs. Person C used to be like that, but he is now focused on playing music, skiing, sports, i.e. the other pleasures in life. A realized that he was in the middle, and had a choice of which path to pursue. Person C's life path was the clear choice.
