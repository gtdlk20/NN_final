The first hour was the real hallucinogenic one; colors intensified and reality seemed to... expand? everything clear, as if conscience feeling it was cleaner; the park turned out to be a faery forest, and though it was just a 'whole hallucination' I wouldn't have been surprised if I saw any elves or so :). Grass was alive, behaving like green waves, and reality felt like if I have put on the Master Ring (well, not that much, but maybe one of the minor ones ;) )
