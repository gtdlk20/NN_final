It was the first night of bonnaroo 2004 with dave mathews shitty set an umphreys show comming up.  It was about 8:45 and I decided that smoking pot and eating ganja goo balls wasen't enough for my anticipated umphreys show so I decided to pick up some chronic mushrooms.  I placed the boomers in a ham and cheese sandwitch and munched it down.  Now I am an extreemly expirence mushroom eater going through both good and bad trips and getting through them.
