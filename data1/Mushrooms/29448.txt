Aftereffects: This trip was like a crash course in self-realization and many things I learned from it resonate deeply with buddhist philosophy, which I began reading about afterwards in an attempt to integrate the experience. I now live a much happier life and am seeking to soberly regain some of the mental states I achieved on the trip, with some success. I find now that any activity, mental or physical, that is done with awareness toward the goal of achieving mastery of myself or mastery of the physical world, feels different and more obviously positive. It has been easier for me to interact with people as though they are an extension of myself, deserving of love.
