Sept. 28  Checked for growth today.  I now have a total of ten jars with at least a little growth.  Only two Treasure Coast jars have yet to show signs of growth.  These two jars arent showing signs of contamination so Ill wait until day 15 to throw them out.  One jar however appears to be rather water logged, a leak during pressure cooking caused this I believe.  I am giving it more time because another jar that seemed water logged is showing growth.  The best jar could have its birthday maybe in 10 days and the best few all within 15.  All jars showing growth will be ready within 23 I would guess.  The cakes with a lot of growth have obviously shrunk in size on the sides where theres growth.  Temp has been constant between 81 and 88 since the last entry five days ago.  As far as I can tell, no jars are showing signs of contamination, it appears I could possibly have a successful first attempt at growing shrooms.
