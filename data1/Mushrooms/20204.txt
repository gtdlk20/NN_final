I remember looking up at Muse. She was gorgeous. My mushroom visuals, which were now quite intense, forming intricate and concrete patterns, made her look as though she were a goddess. I seemed to be able to see an aura surrounding her. I know it sounds rather cliche, but itÂ’s true. I also began to make out a third eye on her forehead, this made me laugh since I had never considered myself to be in close contact with such an enlightened individual as the girl I had been going out with for over a year and a half.
