I realised I was the only one standing and I did not want to spend the entire trip selecting the music so I tried to get the Organic Vibrations Spotify playlist on my friend's mobile to no avail. I often release physically (vomit or diarrhoea) when I do entheogens, and this time it wasn't the exception. I went to the loo and on my way grabbed my phone that I knew had the list saved. After some struggle getting the speaker sorted, the list was on and we could all sink in.
