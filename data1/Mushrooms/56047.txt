When my friend came back in we started to flow together in a river of feelings where we felt what the other felt, we shared our universes.. For a moment I stared the dark corner of the cottage and sad thoughts came to my mind and fear... The worst part in that situation was that when I went in the dark part of myself I felt how it made my friend feel who was hugging me in total sadness and trying to get me out from there... that got me out and the darkest hour was behind.
