My room was still evil to me, but I felt like I needed to seperate myself from everyone, I was freaking out.  I locked and deadbolted my door.  Unable to turn on the light or open the shade, I flopped on the bed and tried to regain a feeling of safety, of self-esteem, almost.  But there were those sticky, ugly drips on the ground.  There was that nasty spoon on the desk.  How embarrassing, there was my bra on the pile of clothes over there.  Soon, my clothes felt suffocating.  I ripped them off and tried to go to sleep.  I lied there listening to myself breathing.  After I felt like I had gotten over this fear, I rolled over, only to saddness.
