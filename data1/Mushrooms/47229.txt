After watching this bizarre spectacle for some time I became aware of a human face occupying the center of my vision, it was a beautiful girl, about 20 years old, with long dark hair, I seemed I was seeing her through a heavily leaded plate glass window, the cracks between the panes of this glass actually turned out to be holes into a far deeper field, as I peered through them I was aware of dazzling lights and flashing stars moving down towards me.
