Then a bubble of cognition rose to the surface of my consciousness.  Sing!  McKenna had said that when he gets into a tight spot he sings.  I began by intoning an Om sound.  This quickly mutated into a simple, but satisfying little tune that I sang to myself for hours on end.  I was pure undefined being, and I was vibrating with the sound of my own energy.  All around me I could sense other beings singing their own little cosmic songs.  There were strands of DNA, photons, and electrons all humming with the information of their individualized frequencies.  We were singing to each other.  I then understood why tone and music were so basic to the human experience.  All being sang with the frequency of its energy.  Presences floated by.  I met them, recognized them and we sang our songs to each other.
