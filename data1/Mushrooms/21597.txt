I got to Dees house at about 11:00pm. His brothers were away that night and it was just him, his parents, and I. We did some quick and sloppy research on shrooms and decided we were going to go through with it. The internet made them sound like nothing serious. It described the experience as euphoric, creative, and philosophical. It mentioned the possibility of life-changing spiritual experience. I was skeptical of that since I had been searching for a legitimate form of spirituality my entire life. We had heard that shrooms grown on cow manure which grossed us out so we went out to buy delicious food to drown out the bad taste. In the future I would learn that mushrooms only grow on manure in the wild and any mushrooms purchased for ingesting was most likely grown on a rice cake in extremely sterile conditions. Dee and I stopped at Dunkin Donuts where I got a bacon, egg, and cheese croissant, which has always been a staple in my diet. He got pretzels which I thought was a terrible idea since the taste of pretzels can hardly overpower anything. Finally, we picked up a large amount of orange juice, because we had read that it makes the mushroom experience better in some way. We werent sure how exactly, but it is rumored to heighten the visual aspect of the hallucinations.
