I went into the laundry room and 'B's underwear folded up on the dryer turned into a black cat. It was strange and I wanted to be with my friends so I went and sat down to watch T.V. Girls gone wild was on it was soooo stupid. I was making fun of the people on T.V. so badly. To this day I am mesmorized by the stupidity in those damn things. I was stuck in some kind of electronic cycle. It was like the same series of events happened 20 times. What confused me was that it was an infomerical, so they just repeat every 10 minutes. I was saying the same thing over and over and over again without even realizing it at the time to my friend 'C', and I knew it too, I just kept saying them though. I knew that I could now relate to those 'crazy' people who just sit and do the same thing over and over and over again. I was quasi-worried that it wouldn't stop, but it didn't bother me. For some reason I was content to be stuck in the trip. I looked around the room at my friends(all of which were sleeping except 'C' and realized that people are just basically 'pseudo-sophisticated' animals. That no matter how rich, powerful, poor, weak, beautiful, ugly, cool, or lame someone is, they will always be the same species as me. It was a beautiful moment.
