ItÂ’s new years day! So many of our pressures and worries just washed away. This is what a holiday is supposed to be like. I experienced this revelation and it was all about every detail that lead up to this point. So many details were totally beyond my control and they have all come together to bring us to this place. It dawns on me that this is divine providence. Today is a gift from God!
