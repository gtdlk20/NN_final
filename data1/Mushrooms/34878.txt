The rest of the night, I'm not that interested in sharing.  I continued to freewrite and even got on aim to cause a little mischief and engage in interesting conversation with some friends.  It was odd because I felt very strangely rational, although I was obviously not in a 'sober' frame of mind.  I eventually went to bed, where I laid with my eyes closed, although it didn't seem to make a difference whether they were open or closed.  My mind was racing and I wasn't sure I would be able to sleep.  To be honest, it didn't feel like I slept much at all.  Reality and dreams were pretty intermingled as some strange images (much more controlled and artistic) still came into my mind and I remember thinking it was a pity that I was not an artist.  All in all, a great experience, even the discomfort in the beginning was strangely fun.
