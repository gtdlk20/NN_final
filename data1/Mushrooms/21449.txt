I went on this trip with a sitter who was also going to trip, but who has extensive experience with the chosen plant.  I chose to read up on the plant and admonishments for use (such as 'this is not a party drug, but more of a turn the lights out and be quiet drug'), but purposefully chose not to read anyone else's experiences prior to use, so as not to color my own first use.
