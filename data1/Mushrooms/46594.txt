It was summer vacation, and the weather was perfect. Me and my buddy P decided we should try some of the shrooms that had been going around. It was the first time either of us had tripped or done anything besides drink or smoke (mj, that is). The shrooms were white and bruised blue and it was mostly stems, a few caps. The stems, though, were really thick and I have since never seen any like it. We ate them as soon as we got them, driving back to my house (10 min. away). It was about ten o'clock by the time we got home.
