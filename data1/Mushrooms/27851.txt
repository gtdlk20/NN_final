At zero hour minus one week, remove all toxins from your diet - meats, alchohol, refined sugars, even our friendly green ally. Maintaining a strict vegan diet consisting mainly of rice, beans, cereals, grains, fruits, and vegetables is recommended. Drink plenty of water. Meditate 30 to 60 minutes a day on the purpose of your journey to meet (fill in the deity or entity of choice). Prepare a question, or questions, or a prayer, or a piece of information to pass on. Preparation, reason, and readiness are the keys here.
