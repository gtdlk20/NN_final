So I lay back down again and by this time the music sounded fantastic. It couldn't have been more perfect. I still had the impression that I would be sick though. Back upstairs. Still confused. Still couldn't work out what I was supposed to do. For some reason I picked up a bottle of toothpaste, opened the window and tried to throw it outside. It didn't work though, and the bottle balanced itself neatly on the ledge, and I thought that was pointless so I picked it back up and put it back. For some reason I kept thinking over and over again: 'I am transcendental cheese!'. I also identified that there was actually eight days in a week, the eighth day being a day between Monday and Tuesday, namely - Cheeseday!!!
