We reached the end of the trail about a half hour later.  It wound up a steep hill to a little sitting area at the top.  Some of us chose to climb all the way up and watch the setting sun.  It was slightly overcast during the day, so the rays cut colorful swaths through the clouds as the sun set and the evening breeze tickled us.  I stood with my friend, L, and we would just look out and watch it all and then smile or laugh at each other at how beautiful it all was.  I felt so amazingly connected to nature and to my friends all I could do was laugh...  so much joy.
