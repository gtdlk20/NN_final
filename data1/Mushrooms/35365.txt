I have always been a bit leary of the mushroom trip. After 12+ years of exploring the inner territories utilising all sorts of natural and man-made enthoegens, P. Cubensis has always shown me my most difficult times, even more so than many of the rougher-feeling chemicals, including 5meo-dmt & DOM. Not so much any physical side-effects, more like issues accepting the realities that mushrooms presented. Some examples might be that I would have a hard time tripping with my male friends due to feeling a great need to mate (hahahaha) and not wanting to create akward scenarios, or always doing this in party situations that led to stiffled trips, or being with attention grabbers which just annoy me. This past weekend however was nothing but positive. A very good friend of mine spent the winter months perfecting his home cultivating technique. In very short time he had grown a considerable amount of fresh Cubensis for distribution amongst his friends, including myself. So, last sunday night I decided to give this substance another try.
