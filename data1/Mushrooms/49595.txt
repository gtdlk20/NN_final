I have realized after this trip that with mushrooms there is two types of tripping and only some see the 2nd side because they just drink a glass or two and stop and have very nice visuals and body feeling but when you exceed what we like to call 'The Madness Levels' you lose all thought of your original life and grow a new life right then and there, with very intense visuals, auditory sounds, and the inability to walk or talk right.  I suggest that if it is your first time to 'shroom' do not take as much at we took, or if you don't have the mental mindset that its a drug and your taking it for your enjoyment. Ok well as to all who are about to embark on this long beautiful journey...good luck and have a blast.
