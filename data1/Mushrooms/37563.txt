The walk took us hours because we were distracted by everything in sight-- stopping to examine the beauty which surrounded us. We finally reached Pauls house... only to find he wasn't home. Standing under a streetlight, confused as hell and failing to form coherent sentences as we tried to figure out what to do next, the sluggish 'I own the road' sound of a cop cruiser crept down the street. With his window rolled down, the officer stared us in the eyes as he drove by at about 1mph, and then he drove past us, seemingly uninterested. Nader and I exchanged a quick 'oh shit lets get out of here' glance, and began to head in the opposite direction. Upon our departure, however, the cop turned around and came back, with his lights on and his spotlight shining in our eyes.
