The imagery of the mandala of that first moment was very close in feeling to H.R.Giger and if I have to link it to a mythical image it would be a machine-Garden of Eden.  The presences there were soulless algorithmic subroutines which looked like Giger gods of darkness and death.  And I was one of those gods or rather, I was that 4-bit mandala, that Giger Garden of Eden itself.  Yet I was conscious and aware and knew that this couldnt be it  this wasnt me.  It felt like the self-realisation of a bacteria or of a protein sequence not content with just being a function and fighting, fighting for all of my worth to remove myself from that situation.  Another variation of that thought I went through was that I was an algorithm hitting the beginning of its program, the hardware, the wires of the machine, the IO port that isnt a port but the bitter end and the beginning.  This experience is the Axiom of logic: the point where logic grinds to a halt as it cannot reason or logically deduce the why and how of the situation.  When you experience eternity, logic has to make way for intuition and the acceptance of the paradox.  Acceptance, trust, embrace, dissolution of identity and of boundary.  Eternal infinite being just is so enjoy it  something reason cannot fathom.
