I began to cry, I was just marveling at how beautiful everything was. I was literally overwhelmed with joy. I was ranting to M about how life was so beautiful and how everything felt so wonderful and I was really having the time of my life. But it was getting late and it probably wasnt the smartest idea to lay down in the middle of a trail outside the towns village tripping balls off shrooms. So we went back to the car to relax. I dont remember much of the trip walking back to the car because this is when the trip started to go sour.
