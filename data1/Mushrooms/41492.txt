I dont know how long it takes before I'm gone again but this time I'm in what I can describe as a desert fortress its all white and its the loneliest place on earth, far far from any living being and I'm just walking around those sad lonely buildings, not knowing what to make of it. I could leave at any time but I felt I should stay around and see if anything happens. But theres nothing, just extreme sadness and loneliness. While contemplating that later I think I was shown the extreme of my own not so social side and I think it helped me be a little more social.
