We walked back to the cabin in the graying twilight (~+6:00).  I was horribly cracked out, and the kind bud wasn't helping.  I was more tired than I could ever remember being.  Other people staying at the cabin had started a fire, and I just sat by that, still off baseline, looking up at the stars from the confines of my own little world.  It would take 15 hours of sleep to get back to baseline after that trip, but it was worth every bit of it.  The insight that I gained on that trip has been with me ever since.
