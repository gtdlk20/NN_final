At this point in my life I was an avid marijuana smoker. I smoked the best stuff available just about every day. I never had much experience with a psychedelic substance besides a one time experiment with the legal herb salvia. I thought that would be enough mental preparation to handle almost any hallucinogen, since I had read that salvia is the most potent psychedelic. I would later beg to differ. At the time, I thought a hallucination was seeing something that is not there. I later would learn that a hallucination is actually any type of perception without the use of our five senses. I anticipated seeing gentle colors, laughing a lot, and not much else. It was just something I wanted to do because I thought it might be fun and allow me to brag to my friends how much fun it was. It was just something I wanted to do because I thought it might be fun and allow me to brag to my friends how much fun it was. With an excited mindset, we ate our food and mushrooms. We had each only eaten a half dose of mushrooms, so I thought that I would have half of the average experience. What I didnt know was that there is no way of measuring the amount of active chemical responsible for the effects from one dose to another so one dose may be up to ten times as potent as the next. We had definitely obtained the potent stuff. With our mushroom meals finished, we sat on the large leather brown couches in his New Room and we waited.
