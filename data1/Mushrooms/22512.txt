That in mind, I started experiencing my body in a new, and uncomfortable, way. Every sensation, and often they were dysphoric such as gastric pain, became zero-dimensional, not confined to physical boundaries Â– it would be nonsensical if they were. I also stopped naming them. They were just... things... that were happening. This disconnection from my body quickly drew me into a bizarre state of mind. I reasoned that I was pure experience, without dimension, without boundaries. These sensations, and thoughts, neither of which were confined to a body, were all I really was. Therefore, I deduced, I must be one with everything. And that would make me... God.
