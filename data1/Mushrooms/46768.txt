A week later I'm on the bus to my friends university with another friend, also going for the shrooms and to visit. I'd read a lot about mushrooms and I was very prepared. To get my mind into the right frame before taking mushrooms, I decided to read a childhood book I had always cherished, Sideways Stories from Wayside High. The book always made me feel good, and reminded me of my public elementary school days, a time I adore to this day. I read the book on the way up to the University.
