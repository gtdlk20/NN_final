Eventually, we arrived at a Park about ten minutes from my house. This was probably close to an hour after ingestion. This is when I lost it. We all sat down, and I gazed at the beauty of mother nature. Every single blade of grass was visible, the trees gently looming over us, the clouds moving in a strange way. There was a small play area for kids in the park with swings, slides, and poles (no one was there though). I was amazed by the colors. I couldn't get over it. I just kept saying 'why cant we stay here forever.' After that I dont really remember what happened in the park, except for sitting there for at least an hour (which seemed like forever), smoking cigarettes and a couple bowls. It took us about twenty minutes to smoke a bowl. We took out a bud and just stared at the thc slowly moving in and out of the rich crystally green nug. When we arrived back home, I started to peak. Everything was imensely bright. I can remember seeing different shades of purples and blues in places that they should not have been, and patterns on walls/furniture would move,kinda of breathe, almost tingle and melt together. My friends decided it would be fun to watch a movie, and I decided I wasn't up to that. But I didn't mind them. I went upstairs, and after looking around for a while, I decided to take a shower.
