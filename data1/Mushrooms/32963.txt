At this point, my mind and focus were very clear, although lacking any sense of ego, but to me it seemed that the distance from the sinks in the bathroom to the stalls had doubled between my walk in, and my walk out. Also, on my way in, I swear I saw only one or two sinks, and when I returned there were four. The walls were certainly moving, and my reflection in the mirror was enticing. Meeting Camille out in the hall once more, she wondered what had taken me so long, and was amused I guess by the similarity and strangeness of the experience. Voices from some theatre workshop down the hall were drifting in, and seemed artificial, as did really everything around me at that point. I could certainly relate to Alice, or any other adventurer or psychonaut who has tried to describe the trip to Wonderland.
