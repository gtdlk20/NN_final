This trip started like any other. It was a Friday afternoon, and after school dismissed around 2:00 a couple of friends and I decided to pick up a half ounce of mushrooms for the evening. (My original plan was to eat them in school that day and trip in class, but I wasn't able to get them from the dealer soon enough).
