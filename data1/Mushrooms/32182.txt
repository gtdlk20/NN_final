We all returned to our camp and stood in silence, each of us knowing what the other felt and saw. While we were standing, we heard a strange squeaking noise. Looking around, we noticed that there were four woodpeckers all around us; nature had grown so comfortable with us being there. We watched our little friends look for food and listened to them laugh like Woody Woodpecker. After a while, we decided it was time to leave. The beautiful sunset guided us out of the forest and led us back to #1Â’s home. We walked for an hour, all of us humming the tunes we had created while in the forest. I felt connected to the world, to life, like I have never felt before. Each of us was reborn and renewed; we all broke through the barriers we had created throughout our lives.
