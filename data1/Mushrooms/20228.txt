I was a young man, and I had just returned from Vietnam. I was with my wife again after years apart, and I shouldve been happy, but I wasnt. I didnt know this woman anymore. Well actually I did, she seemed a little older and more tired, but what was worse was that she didnt know me anymore. She didnt see the images of war that I did. She didnt experience the horrible aspects of human life. She saw war glorified by the government and I saw death.
