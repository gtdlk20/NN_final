I tried to meditate, and had this vision of a woman standing...over me? near me? She was enveloped in red.  She was encouraging me to breathe, deep meditative breaths.  I listened.  I realized at that moment that, without this woman to help me, I didn't think my lungs would inhale on their own.  As I kept rhythmically breathing in and out, she changed colors, from red to orange to yellow to green...she was helping me open and ignite my chakras! I opened my eyes, feeling very electrified and eager.
