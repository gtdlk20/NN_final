I looked into the possible counter indications and safety considerations and concluded that I was not in any danger (such as from being on medications which would make therapy unsafe, or having a family history or behavioral diagnosis which would make therapy unsafe). For example, I am not on Lithium or a MAOI or Tricyclics. Nor had I had any suicidal thoughts or tendencies. Nor did I, as Fadiman states, have 'desire to look deep into the darkness or into the nature of evil'.
