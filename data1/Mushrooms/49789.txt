One of the houses look very 'inviting', with nice lights and a great porch. Everyone feels that the house is drawing our attention to itself and also that it wants us to come closer. But in front of the enlighted porch there's a house that feels 'wrong' together with an 'evil and dark' tree, so we walk past it. After a while we turn around and start walking back. We run into J's friend, who also lives in the neighbourhood, as he comes driving in his car with his girlfriend. They stop and come out to say hi. Me and N start staring at his car, N thinks the car is swinging, I just think it's vibrating. We are still pretty weird standing there laughing at the car. J's friend must have thought we were insane.
