Now outside, I sat in the front yard, it was thick with small plants about the ankle I sat forever and tripped. Hard. IÂ’ll spare the details but generally I need to be looking at something to really get visual, this time however the air was latent with texture, bubbles and beautiful women, all sorts of patterns just in the air. Junebug got a little better then a little worse and then M put him to bed. The three left started to watch terminater 2, but it got to me, the apocolyps scene. So I went to rest a bit.
