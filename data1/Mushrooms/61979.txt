After we ate our share of the mushrooms, I felt kinda sick and anti-social for like 15minutes. Sick because mushrooms are poison.  When the trailer started, I noticed my fingers and just how complex they looked and how cool they looked when they were moving soon after I started wiggling my toes and couldnt stop! The movie was amazing as johnny depp's face was melting and the oompaloompa songs were just so nice.  The kid willy wonka looked so fake with his braces.  I remember that we were noisy.  After the movie kids were running around the theatre, they looked like oompaloompaS!!!
