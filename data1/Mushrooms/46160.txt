From then on the follow up stopped. To make sure a bad trip wouldnt get any chance, I penned down in advance when the trip should more or less end. I had foreseen 24:00, but lets say that was an hour, hour and a half later. I had sweaty hands throughout the trip, was feeling pretty energetic. I had cigarettes and some kick ass marijuana, New York Diesel and Amnesia Haze, both very strong Soma Strains, but I drank water and didnt smoke. There just wasnt the impulse to supplement the trip with THC effects. I saw a disgusting anti-smoking ad and immediately decided to quite smoking. Which is still the case. I had hoped for therapeutic effects as I had experienced with previous LSD sessions and I can moderately subscribe to them: some of the issues with my wife got answered, but at the same time other questions arose. I also decided to quit smoking.
