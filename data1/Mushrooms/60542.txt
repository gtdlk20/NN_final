All track of time was lost.  When I finally opened my eyes I had night vision.  Everything was in black in white, but with the same translucent spinning colors.  When I looked up to the trees I saw silouettes of monkees holding hands, tails and feet.  They started moving and grew eyes, and other features.  I felt as if I was turning back into a monkee.  Losing my corrupt human spirit and going back to what we should be, a pure and innocent being.  My friend and I started talking and we got up and walked around a bit in the forest.  All of a sudden we stopped talking.  I saw a hobbit like creature running across, the hobbit looked at me and ran toward me.  It looked at me and then pointed to the sky above me.  It said 'The moon'  I looked at the moon, when I turned my head, the hobbit had disappeared.  We decided to go to downtown and get some coffee.  When we looked at a clock, we realized that it was almost 1 a.m.  I was still getting amazing open eye visuals.
