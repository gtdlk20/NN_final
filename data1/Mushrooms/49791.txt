While J was talking to his friend me, P and N walked away on a road leading up. We stopped at fence made out of spruces. We started touching its needles who were wet with rain. It feel strange but at the same time very nice. The needles looked like they were made out of plastic. After continuing up the road we ended up at the magical house again. We felt very smart, we had found another way to the house without the 'evil' tree. We went up to the house, standing outside looking at it for a couple of minutes. N thought it looked like a plastic house but at the same time very nice. I thought it was a trap, something was trying to draw us to it. We stared at the house for a while and then we went back to J's place.
