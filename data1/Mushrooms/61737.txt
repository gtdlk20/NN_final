May 20th is my birthday and I wanted to hang out, ya know chill with my homiies eat some shrooms, get wasted, and just have a good night if you know what I mean. I woke up around 11:00 and got a ride to the heights around 12:00pm. After around 2:00pm I got the mushrooms and waited till aound 5:30pm and ate the shrooms with about 7 other people trippin balls!! This is my 5th time on mushrooms and the most horrorifing thing ever!I ate them on an empty stomache and drank a couple beers ya know thought I was having a good time.  Then all of a suddon it hitt me I felt like everyone hated me I was so scared of everyone I felt like I was on a rollercoaster going 100mph in every single direction, getting tossed around like a rag doll and seeing a blur of collors. Then I felt like a had to vomitt so I fell down and puked on the ground. After I looked and the shroom I threw up looked like it was growing bigger and bigger. My sister noticed I was having a bad trip so she helped me and got me a blanket to lay down on.
