I hop out of the shower I am still acting, my character is now humbled, no humiliated and stunned as a gesture of my commitment to my new, clean life I will start by cleaning the shower. I procure cleaning agents and tools from the kitchen and begin. I do a not too bad job and then I am just tired. I believe at this point that I am in my right mind, but I am not.
