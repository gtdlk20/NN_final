A painless birth requires patience and the absolute ability to let go.  I waited and when overwhelmed, I sang.  I sang myself into existence.  I was the mother, the midwife, and the child.  I was never alone.  There was always a presence of sorts watching over the scene, silently informing my intuition.  I had absolute trust in the process.  I had no choice.
