I was joining some friends at a Phil Lesh & Friends (ex Grateful Dead) concert at an outdoor amphitheatre on Long Island in the summer of 2002.  I hadn't ingested psilocybin in roughly a year, and I had never done so in such a public setting.  My previous experiences with the substance had always been intimate and safe, and yet even in the confines of a room or apartment my reactions had always been stronger than those of my peers.  I don't know why I didn't consider these facts on this particular day.  It was a mistake that I paid dearly for.
