The first noted effects was a little churning in my stomach. This could very well have been psychological, because I expected it, but it turned out to be very mild and fleeting. About 45 minutes after eating the gel caps I was starting to feel a bit heavy, but in a good way. Like, extra relaxed. I also noticed a nice tryptamine buzz coming on, which if you haven't experienced it, feels kind of like energy flowing through your veins. But not in an amphetamine-like way. In a God-energy like way. The body energy of various tryptamines, like mushrooms, 4-ACO-MIPT, DMT, and LSD are similar, but feel like they tune in to the God-energy on slightly different wavelengths. LSD and 4-aco-mipt have steady, shorter waves; and DMT and mushrooms have more variable waves. The more variable waves gives the impression of another force conducting how you (or perhaps I should just say 'I') feel. Therefore I believe the mushroom and DMT tune one in to the God-energy frequency most closely.
