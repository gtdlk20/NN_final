I dont think this will be the last time I take mushrooms but Im also not opposed to letting most of the mushrooms in my patch go through their natural cycles. This experience was quite intense but I do feel mentally cleansed - Im glad only a part of the trip was unpleasant but in a way Im also glad I went through this unpleasant part. And I feel oddly empowered from knowing that if Im down, there is this internal voice that can tell me what to do, and it seems I can trust it.
