Me and TK went over to E's house. We stayed in the family room, and around 11:30 PM me and TK ate the mushrooms. They tasted great! Chocolate covered mushrooms are the way to go. Anyway we started playing video games to pass the time. Around 12, my body starts feeling twichy and waves feel like they are going up my body. A basic weed body high feeling for me. Then I enter my new world. What happened was I looked across the room at a vase full of flowers, and the flowers moved slowly back and forth, like there was a gentle breeze, but there was no breeze. I looked over to TK who was twitching a bit and said 'Hey, do those flowers look like they are moving to you?' He looked over at them and said 'Ohhh man' then he went completely crazy, the high hit him like a ton of bricks. He claimed his brain would twitch, which caused his entire body to jerk around, and he laughed uncontrollably.
