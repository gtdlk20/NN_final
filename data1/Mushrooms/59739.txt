Oct.  22  Picked the first open caps, 1 oz.  I ate those this morning.  My normal dose is one fresh ounce, and these had to be the strongest mushrooms I have ever had.  My recommendation to anyone just planning on growing one strain of Cubensis for personal use, I would get the Puerto Rican strain.  They are amazing.
