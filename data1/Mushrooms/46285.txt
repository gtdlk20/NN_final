He came back in a few minutes with 2 plates of chips. I picked one up and held it in my fingers for a while in order to sample the texture and image of it. Although a bit apprehensive about eating it I eventually put the chip in my mouth and bit down. After swallowing it I realised that the chip was actually swimming in vinegar and quite quite disgusting. The whole thing was soggy and fowl tasting and I swear it wasnt made out of real potato. I then turned on Tim to try and understand why hed bought 2 plates of these horrible snacks.
