The next period I felt very excited, Im not quite sure what I was excited about. luckily we had a substitute teacher. I was drawing through the whole period and Im not a very good artist, but I noticed my errors and I had much more control when I was DUI(drawing under the influience..heh..) so the sub asked me to pass out papers and I tried so so so hard, but I just couldnt keep my mind on passing them out. Its like I had much more important things to think about(life, death, my faults, god).
