This was an interesting trip for me.  I've always taken small doses - 2g was on the larger side.  It was sunset.  We walked up on a hill by some houses to watch as we ate our doses.  Although it looked as though we were well away from the houses, someone came out and helpfully informed us that we were on private property.  I've always hated angering people, even when I believe I haven't harmed them.  This conflict in my mind between the beautiful land, which gives itself freely to all, and anger in the mind of my fellow man stuck with me.  I've been hoping to let go of my control, though, so I proceeded with that in mind.  We left and walked west, and followed the sun!  It was a beautiful time, and though it was a very cold day, we struck out happy.
