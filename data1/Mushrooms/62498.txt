I'm not sure about the legal status of these kits anywhere other than where I am but it seems to be that you can get them, grow them and eat them, but if you prepare them for consumption (i.e. dry, cook etc) then they become illegal. I've effectively countered this (I think) by having them growing inside my room and eating them as I feel.
