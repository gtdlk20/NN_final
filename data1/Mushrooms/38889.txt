Getting stoned was fun. From ninth grade and on, I was quite the casual toker in my high school. I had lots of fun just chilling out, listening to music, and firing up a bowl of nice green bud. My Dad's a Vietnam veteran and knows what weed is, because almost every soldier over there was getting drunk or stoned most of the time. I'm pretty sure my Dad knew exactly what I was doing but simply didn't know how to approach me about it.
