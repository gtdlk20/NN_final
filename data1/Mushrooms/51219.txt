The next thing I know, I wake up, and look at my clock. 3:14am. What the hell happened? I found my girlfriend passed out on the couch, the tv still on. A few scattered bodies were lying on chairs, the floor, wherever they could crash. I woke up one of my buddies, who told me I had missed New Year's, something, which I already knew.
