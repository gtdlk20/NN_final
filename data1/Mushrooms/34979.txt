But right after I had thought it had all ended, all my visuals were coming to a close, I felt very sick, to the point where I went to the garbage and started gagging.  It immediatley went away without throwing up.  I walked down stairs and stood in front of a mirror after a shower.  I looked at my head.  I just staired at it.  All of a sudden images, somewhat heavenly and bright started coming off my forehead and my strongest OEV occured: my nose stretched all the way to the side of my face while my neck grew skinny and my head sort of rose up.  My jaw had dropped and the psylocibin dispersed from my brain at that moment, rendering me completely sober.  What an unexpected twist to the end of my adventure.
