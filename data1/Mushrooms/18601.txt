I determined that my wife would not be the best guide (just like it is not generally wise to have a loved one operate on you). I chose a close friend, - a warm, trusting individual, who happened not only to share my faith tradition, but was sympathetic to this unorthodox type of therapy. He had also long ago taken mushrooms himself, which Fadiman recommends. My friend was also intimately acquainted with my issues and depression, and knew empathetically my plight and lack of success in mainstream medicine and therapy.
