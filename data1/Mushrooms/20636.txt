First came the patterns, which began as geometric fractals with a distinctly organic feel to them. There weren't really any colors just yet, at least which I can remember, but it didn't take long for everything to ramp up. Once I began to lose myself in the patterns, I noticed I kept losing more and more control over my body and I began to roll around on my bed and drool. Quite honestly, it felt a bit like being a baby again. Of course, my immediate question to this presence was "what are you," to which I immediately received the almost hokey response of "I am you and you are me". Regardless of what I was talking to, I was honestly kinda unimpressed. I wanted to be more certain that this was more than some random new neuronal connection, and that I wasnÂ’t just talking to my pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus, or something. Something that felt so completely alien could not possibly be me, yet on some level it felt as if it had always been there. It was probably just trying to ease me into what was about to happen.
