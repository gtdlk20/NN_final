~5:00am - Eventually, I went into Mark's room and lay on the bed with Carly, Kelsey and Luke, and as we were starting to come down we talked for a couple hours about all the night's events.  As I came down, I felt better than I've felt in a long time.  I was completely optimistic and just in overall great spirits.  I think we finally were able to get to sleep around 6:30.
