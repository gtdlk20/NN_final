I began to dance. I came up with the most individually unique dance there. I made my head into a graphic equilizer for the drums, shaking it crazily in all directions at phenominal speeds, paying for it in neck cramps/pains for 3 days afterwards. I was spinning and rotating my arms in this undescribale way. It was kind of an equilizer for the way I was feeling inside with the drums judging how fast they went, or something like that, nevermind, it's useless. But I danced, and I danced, and I got the most peculiar looks from everybody, because just looking at the way I was dancing, they all knew I was way out there and I knew they all knew but it didn't bother me because it didn't bother them. I danced for like an hour, singing tool lyrics in an Indian style way that sounded so synergistic with everything else going on.
