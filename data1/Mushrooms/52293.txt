The last course of thinking I was invited on by the mushrooms was one of perception.  I had often thought that we each live in a separate world simply because our beliefs differ so staggeringly from each other.  As I was always so fond of pointing out to one religious friend, At the end of my life my existence ceases, at the end of your life, an eternal life in happiness.  Surely we live in different worlds?  The mushrooms showed this to be even more true than I thought before and I have gone on to wonder about the true nature of things and the way we perceive them.
