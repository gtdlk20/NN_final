Time nearly stopped for a while, and I couldn't believe when it was only 12:30 am. It seemed to have been going on for hours and hours. I told Z at one point 'I feel like I'm going to be this way forever.' Then not wanting him to worry, I added 'I know I won't, it just feels that way.' I remembered with detachment the time years ago, lying on my face in the park in Berkeley, tripping too hard on acid and getting all worked up and freaked out about the fact that I couldn't remember how I used to think; I felt like I'd broken my brain and I'd never get back. This time, no such fear. No need to remember how I used to think.
