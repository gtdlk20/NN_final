Buddy is an average/medium large sized dog, about 60 to 75 lbs and about two and a half years old.  He's a mixed breed rottweiler/black lab with long black hair with golden patches.  He's a very kind playful dog, kind to strangers, very smart, and mentally stable, I know him very well.  He likes to get high with us when ever we smoke, we blow out our hits and let him brethe them in.  A great dog with a great personality.  This would be his first trip.  We figured a MUCH smaller dose would work for him. Concidering weight and the fact that we didnt really know how dogs react to shrooms I got a small cap out about the size of a nickle (about 0.3 grams I would estimate) and held it out to Buddy.  He came and ate it and we drank our tea. The tea actually tasted great.  I highly recomend making tea, no stomach problems, and the taste is very mild.  Psilocybin is very water soluble and almost none of it is left in the shrooms.
