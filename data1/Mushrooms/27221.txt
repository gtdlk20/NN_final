I awoke yesterday, august 13th, 2002, not knowing what was going to happen.  I was with my girlfriend that day, doing some serious thinking about our relationship.  I decided it was time for an end, as we were both going to away to college.  I regrettably ended our relationship at probably around noon or 1pm.  As soon as she left I felt horrible.  I started to cut parts of my body to try to create pain.
