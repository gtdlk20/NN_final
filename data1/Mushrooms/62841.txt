Effects started faster than usual, after about 15 minutes I started noticing 'life' popping up everywhere.  The christmas ornaments started looking at me, some evil, some good.  I went outside and noticed they trees.  They 'told' me the only way they could talk/move was through wind.  I noticed some 'gnomes' (about the size of garden gnomes) that were hidden in the bark of a neighbor's tree. Each blade of grass was alive, beaming as the sun beat off them.  In the foreground of a sunset, a leaf spiraled to the ground, and I realized that life abounds in everything, from the macro to the micro.  Even the birds that were painted on the thermostat were alive.  This energy/lifeforce told me that all you had to do was notice it and smile back.
