My friend continues to act weird. He keeps saying he needs water, I tell him to come get some, but he does not follow. I bring him some water, and he's still acting strange. I keep asking him basic things like,'you want more water?' and he is responding with noncongruent questions like, 'is that so?', 'oh really?' Totally oblivious to the present moment. I start getting upset, I thought he could handle his shit, but he's gone full incoherent on me. Finally my friend comes to get some water. He keeps asking if he can have it even though I told him fifty times he can. I kind of send out bad energy towards him, and all of sudden the worst happens...
