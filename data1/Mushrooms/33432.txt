I ate my mushrooms on the car ride down to the Guadalupe, probably about 30 minutes before we got to the river. By the time we parked I was already feeling the effects pretty strongly and almost hurled in line while waiting for my tube. Floating in the water made life about 100x better, and the large muscular-looking trees that line the Guad made for some spectacular scenery. Also, for whatever reason, there were thousands of butterflies floating around making it almost too beautiful to believe. That may have contributed to my disassociation from reality.
