Across the Universe soundtrack was always music Ive wanted to listen to while tripping, and hadnt yet, she agreed.  Music is very important on a trip because its unavoidable, whenever I am hearing music, my mood changes accordingly.  This soundtrack was especially good because it has songs with different moods, and deeper and partially drug induced meanings, which while on drugs, inspires lots of deep contemplation.
