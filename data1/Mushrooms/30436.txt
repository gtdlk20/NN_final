We arrive at our first camp site as we referred to it  It was in a grassy area near a wall covered in ivy, we were under big trees that were  completely BRIGHT yellow, red and green in color (probably more so because of the shrooms) and it was about 70 out, with a slight wind.   It was an especially beautiful spot because every so often the wind would gust and it would literally rain and array of yellow, red and green leaves.  We laid out the blanket to sit down and begin our trip.
