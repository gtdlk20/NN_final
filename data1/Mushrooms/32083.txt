Set: good mental state, been looking forward to this. Did my regular Wednesday routine, which consists of an hour and a half of yoga in the morning, some light chores throughout the day, and transporting my grandmother from daycare in the afternoon. HavenÂ’t eaten since last night. Starved. Expectations not too high, just hoping to get some noticeable effects.
