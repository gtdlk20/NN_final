We all play roles at different times in our lives - this is important because it is just a way of naming and quantifying the experience. Our brain is this really complex filter for experience. Because we canÂ’t possibly process everything at the same time, if we would we would experience the infinite and not be able to learn anything from its many parts. We have to experience the small parts, and that is exactly what life is. Experiencing the small parts of existence (the universal existence).
