I was in the military at the time stationed in Okinawa Japan. Shrooms are legal there as well as GHB, rush, valium, codeine and several other drugs banned in the USA. Me and a friend (P) had been talking about the various times we had tripped. I had not done it that often but he had. I told him I knew of someone who sold shrooms. They were expensive $100 for a bag good for 2-3 people, but we decided to do it that Friday night anyway.
