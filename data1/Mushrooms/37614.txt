I will skip over the beginning and end of the trip and focus on the peak of it.  For several hours during the trip, I found myself stuck in a loop of circular logic, a sort of infinite recursive process.  I was caught in a frame of mind that repeatedly held conflicting ideas simultaneously.  I could not decide what my next actions would be, both immediately and for the rest of my life.  Who put me here and what is my purpose?  I felt very afraid not knowing.  Suicide crossed my mind, but I retained my usual reasonability and abandoned that idea quickly.
