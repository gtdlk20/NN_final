We went into SmokeyÂ’s, a friendly coffee shop we visited several times.  We asked them about their mushrooms, and they had only one type, some Mexican shrooms of some sort.  I decided to buy some, having been guaranteed the effect would be good.  We all went to get something to eat, and I munched them down with my food.  All three of my mates had also bought and taken the same amount.
