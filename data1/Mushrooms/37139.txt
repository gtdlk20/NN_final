T +2:20 J returns with the contents of her journal and so does Eric, with Kathleen.  Both are amazed by my physical condition.  After hearing J talk about her similarity with Angelica from Rugrats, which made all too much sense to me, I sat down with Eric and Kathleen to decipher J's writing.  Although the content was confusing it was visually very pleasing and I assumed her circling of Is had to do with some sort of ego struggle she had had in Lisas room.  I circled some other Is and an l to and tried to explain that in the incoherent context Is and ls are the same thing, but Eric didnt appear to understand.
