I am a 26 year old male, weighing 125 pounds and generally in good health, although I had been suffering from a recurring cold the last month or so. I generally consume marijuana and yerba mate daily, and kratom off and on, but had been abstaining from these substances for a few days in order to speed my recovery from illness. I had been taking reishi extract and a herbal adaptogen tincture prior to this experience, although I do not feel they had an impact on this experience and I mention them only for completeness.
