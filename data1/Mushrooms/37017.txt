My entourage had significantly dwindled by this time. The two girls who were watching, Jessica and April, had gone off to see a movie. Hank and Mike were the only ones left. We went back to my room and I proceeded to stare at a map of the world I had hanging on my wall. The countries were all changing shapes and sizes, and the map would sink way back into the wall at spots, or come out in big bumps at others. I lay on my back and stared at the ceiling tiles. There were more faces there, chubby people with big cheeks and double chins. The rounded, cartoony shape of them reminded me of Mario and Luigi, but without the moustaches. The wood grain in my furniture was all melting and dripping, I reached to touch it, expecting it to feel soft and gooey, but of course it didnÂ’t.
