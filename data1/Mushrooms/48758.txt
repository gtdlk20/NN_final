All over the back of this guys car, I puked on myself.  I jumped out of the car and ran through a busy street, but I didn't know.  I ran through an alley and hid by a fence.  I couldn't see anything.  It was swirling together and melting.  The guys drove back around to get me, but I wouldn't go with them.  I eventually made it back to my house, where I hid in the backyard, lay in a fetal position, thinking I was going to the hospital.  I realized I had to face my dad, who so happenly thought I was drinking.  I told him the truth and started crying,  he put me in the shower.  My mom flipped out on me, grabbed my face and started yelling, then punched my sister for trying to break it up.
