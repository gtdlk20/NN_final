And now comes the part where I try to make sense of this friggin experience.  Well....I find no coincidence that the concept (which my writing above does no justice) of heaven and hell is the same damn thing that I thought was right initially before the trip.  So woopdeedoo.  I also find no surprise that I am totally obsessed with art.  I swear to you I am all about it and it helps me cope with the pressures in life.  It is a sort of tool I use to bring me back to the neutral. Whether writing, painting, photography, or my favorite researching all these different focuses in art and trying to find and learn about the best ones.  Whatever.  And as far as the guiding light voice.  I dont know if you ever noticed this but I have a voice that narrarates myself my entire life.  It is the one that says the alarm is going off get up and go to work.  And it is the same voice that speaks when I am thinking or writing a long story.  So essentially this is what I think this all was.
