We are at the top of the forest (Me, B, T) our other friend M showed up and N had magged and fallen in the river twice and lost bother her shoes. This was still ridiculously funny to me and B. When all of a sudden on a cement path behind us connected to a wooden bridge 3 dirt bikers in full sponsored dirt biking apparel drive by and me and B questioned whether it was real or not because of all the fucked up things that happened that night.
