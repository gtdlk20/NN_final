Sterile technique is required for germinating spores, especially if you start with a petrie dish of agar. This method is preferred because you can select the best mycelia to transfer to the growing medium but requires some practice to maintain sterility and extra cost for the equipment (petrie dishes, agar, scalpel, alcohol lamp).  You can start the spores directly on the growth medium, but you have no control over quality.
