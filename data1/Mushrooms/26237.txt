At some point during this I had gotten up and changed my music to Pink Floyd - Animals. This did not help my state I became continuously more depressed, and my experience became continuously more horrific. Minutes seemed to pass like hours, and every second I wanted the trip to just end so I could get to sleep. Several times I left my bed and got out of my room to use the bathroom. Each time, the banister posts on my stairs looked like wooden snakes standing on end, squirming and writhing violently to keep themselves vertical. The colors in this scene were so vibrant that I could not help but be amazed. I also had the sensation that the floor under my feet was rippling and shaking violently, and I had to keep stretching my legs and jumping to maintain my footing on the uneven, constantly changing terrain.
