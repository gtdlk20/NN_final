We arrived at the party location and the onset was complete. The guys at the entrance first thought we were only passersby (since Im almost double the age of the average) but we eventually figured that out. The party location was fun and thoughtfully decorated - it had an ecological theme and all the decoration was only made from things found in the woods (plus some yarn I suppose) and even the entrance-thing was a cloth of cotton printed with: Freedom is a state of mind  if you dont like where you are, change it. Youre not a free.. Strange, quite a depressive saying for a goa party I thought but youre not a free is really describing how Im feeling right now. We tried blending into the party but I suppose there was a lot of speed around and the groove was not really aggressive but somehow not welcoming. So we went for a walk along the river through a forest till we reached a freshly constructed massive concrete flood prevention area  I was amazed by the will and effort to build this. Some 5 minutes later a dramatic intersection of five motorway tracks on high tracks. This was all very impressive and we talked about the beauty of manmade things and the attempt to influence even to direct the future and the risk of failing. Like I was risking losing my job during the attempt of going to study. It was suddenly perfectly clear. That its no trouble at all if they lay me off. That I am prepared to quit this job myself  so I wondered why I worried so much. And felt stupid for it. We watched the super clear sky, talked about pretty much everything, I was having some good visuals and enjoyed them quietly since S. was not on anything and I didnt want to bore her.
