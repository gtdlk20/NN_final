amnesia often associated with the over-consumption of alcohol. I had what at the time seemed like a very vivid, but unrealistic dream that included M pushing me out of the door to his house and screaming 'Get the fuck out of my house!' at me and another sequence in which I threw a glass of water onto M's father and finally ending with a sequence of me in my car throwing things out of my bag around the inside of my car and hitting the windshield. It was at this point around 4:00 A.M. that I regained consciousness in my own car with my rear view mirror broken off and all of my personal belongings strewn around my car and I noted that I didn't have shoes on as I looked down at my grass stained feet. I looked to the left out of the driver's side door and M and his parents were all standing there looking at me in shock. I was then driven to my home while I sat in the back seat wondering what in the world could have possibly caused this strange state of unknowing brutality that caused M to get in a fight with me to get me out of his house. I later looked on the internet for similar experiences, but I couldn't find anything. It should be noted that I am prescribed amitriptyline(20 mg) to take at night to help me sleep, but I did not take it on the night of this occurrence. This medication could have had some interaction, but I could not find any further information documenting the interaction between these two things.
