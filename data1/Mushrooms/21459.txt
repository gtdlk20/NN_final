Eventually a wave of buzziness overcomes me and does not let go. Eventually a wave of buzziness overcomes me and does not let go.  I slide from this buzzed state into a state which I Can only describe as the 'crystal dimension'. My consciousness spreads out in a pattern like a mandala. But unlike a mandala, which is round, circles, and flowing, and perfect, this dimension was angular, lines, and imperfect and sharp, like a microscopic picture of ice crystals.  I can't say how long I stayed in this state..my perception of time went out the window at this point.  No LSD trip I'd ever been on produced visuals so intense, and that blotted out reality so completely.
