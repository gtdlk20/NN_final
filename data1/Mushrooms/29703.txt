My friends that we met, L and G were trying to comfort me. L took on a motherly role in my dilated eyes, and I thought she was my mother. Sobbing hysterically, I tried to lay down on the ground but they kept me upright. Soon after, I adopted a meditative lotus position (which I had never done before) and folded in half until my forehead touched the ground. I began to chew on the dirt and anything I could grab. Following the lotus position, I shut my eyes and began to hear a chorus of feminine voices in my head. They addressed me by name, explaining that they were the voice of the mushrooms I had taken, and promptly began to show me that my past life lived in a very cold, wintery environment. I saw through my Third Vision a blue, icy planet that wriggled and warped with life. I expressed to the voices (through an inner scream) that I dont understand!, to which they responded by showing me the circularity of time, composed of small overlapping circles and arcs that formed large circles, until they formed an ultimate, endless loop.
