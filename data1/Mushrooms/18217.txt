I was looking down at the water, assuming the first visuals would come from the ripples in the water.  It was only when I looked away from the water that I saw them (in fact, I didn't get any visuals from the water beyond occasional tracers the entire trip).  By this time (+1:15) I was beginning to appreciate beauty, and the scene I was in was overwhelming me with it:  The sound of whooshing cars on a highway above, trees lining the banks, a mountain river flowing by 20 feet below our dangling feet, a warm breeze blowing cumulus clouds into creampuffs as it coursed over the mountains and up our valley.  Even though were out of direct sight of the beach, I could hear children playing around the river bend, I could smell pine tar in the air.  I looked down into the endless detail of the granite around me, and it was strewn with pine needles in random, yet orderly positions on the ground.  It was like looking at a fractal, and the needles started to flow, as if drawn by strange attractors all over the 3-dimensional surface of the rock.
