I pleteaued within an hour and a half, and what a time I had! I cried a lot, I laughed even more, and I felt unbelievable joy. I saw the beauty of nature as I never had before. Everything I had read and been told about how mushrooms would change my perception were true. My ablitity to concentrate was increased and diminished all at once. I was able to change my focus at will, or remain on a topic as long as I wanted. But typically, I wanted to do and experience everything at once. Of course I didn't because my body felt heavy and lazy and moving around was no easy feat.
