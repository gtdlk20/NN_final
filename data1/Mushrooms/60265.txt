First, let me expalin I have no ordinary Runner.  It's a 99' Limited 4WD, rims, tires, rack, grille, nurfs, etc. - and a stereo that you would kill for (Boston Acoustic, Alpine and Sound Stream). Ok. . .we got in and loaded The Crystal Method.  Driving down what was once a familiar highway, after about 13 min's, I didn't know where I really was.  I mean, I knew the vicinity, I knew my truck and Trip, but I couldn't remember how to get to the fucking movies.  My skin initially vibed and a twinge started at the base of my skull, radiated outward down my limbs and ended with a plastered smile across my face.  I pulled over into Wal-Mart's parking lot to gain my bearings and park my truck.  I looked over at Max, saw this devilish grin on his face and ended up laughing for about 20 min's - and uncontrolable laugh that had my stomach in cramps and tears streaming from my eyes.  I knew this was going to be a great night.
