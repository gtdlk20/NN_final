I entered into a domain that appeared to similar to outer space, perhaps in space. I felt as my consciousness was suspended in the center of a void. Then within this void an organism appeared to me. This organism appeared as a ball that contained tentacle like masses/body parts emerging from the surface. In a state of astonishment and confusion I decided to ask the mushroom what this thing was. The mushroom replied it is the universe.
