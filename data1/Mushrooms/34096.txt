Laying in bed, I managed to fall half asleep. Now I saw hell. It looked like it was in the earth's core, except instead of being surrounded by lava, I was surrounded by hallucinations. Rainbow colored snakes coming out of every directions. It was like a multi colored lava lamp. Still, everything beautiful. I was in hell with millions of other people. We were all just trying to walk around without stepping on each other, which at the moment I thought was a good metaphor for life. Next I imagined Jerry Seinfeld Standing up in all of this chaos and just decided to do a bit. It was actually very funny, though I can't remember any of it now, and I think it helped me relax a little bit.
