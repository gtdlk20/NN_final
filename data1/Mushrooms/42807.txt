I immediately met my roommate, Evan, and the two of us quickly started getting to know each other and our surroundings. The first week spent there was our orientation week before classes started, and there had been multiple activities organized by the school-student committee. I remember distinctively at one point they held a college-wide dodgeball game to help bring everyone together, and it was there that I would ultimately meet Peter, Zulian, Nicholas, and Mike  four others that would go on to become very good friends of mine during the course of my time spent there.
