While recovering after vomiting, the fear came harder.  I opened my eyes and realized I was floating in blood.  I saw the toilet and it looked massive and it towered over me.  a fountain of blood erupted from the bowl and poured over head.  I wanted to cry, but the vision passed relatively quickly.  I was still extremely uncomfortable, but I was conscious and at least aware of what was going on at this point. I got a friend to drive me home, which was intense in itself.  I was coming down but I was far from back to normal.
