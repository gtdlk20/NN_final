The reason why this turned out to be a good trip is because I believed it would be a good trip beforehand. The reason why four days before this I lost my mind and believed I was God and that 'life' was all some big trick is because I had challenged the mushrooms to show me their dark side. They did, and it was the most confusing thing I've ever experienced. Being able to integrate the concept of transcendental cheese was a hell of a lot easier, that's for sure. :)
