This time we were halted in our tracks by some weird green slimy thing my mate had discovered in a massive puddle at the entrance. We couldn't figure out what it was, until he dropped the slime in some sunlight. Its a mouldy sock! I said. He insisted that it wasnt a sock, but I was convinced it was. It appeared to be made from the same material as a sock when I studied it closely. Then I looked closer at the puddle. It was half covered in the same material. It couldnt be a sock after all, so what the hell was it? We finally managed to escape this tunnel by splashing around through a swamp which we must have gone through to get in, but we were sure it hadnt been there, and it wasnt raining or anything.
