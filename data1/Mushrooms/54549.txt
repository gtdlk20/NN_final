After that I cant recall what I did all day. Basically, the three of us chilled, listened to music, smoked some pot, and took another walk. Then I finally came down after about 8 hours and drank some tea and just chilled. This was by far the best experience I have had with mushrooms. I'm sorry if this report is long or boring, but it is kind of hard to explain what happens when I'm in my own world of shrooms.
