After hours of absorption into this Mystery, we gradually returned to our forms in the bed on planet Earth and compared notes.  We discovered that we were witnessing the same phenomenon simultaneously as it emerged into our inner world, which had become one.  We adopted my wife's name for this, 'The Wisdom Disk.'  Traditionally, this has been known as Sophia, Persephone, The World Soul, etc..  There was also an awareness that this greater Being moved in awareness of a superordinate reality, emanating from a single source, The One.
