After I dropped the 4th and 5th capsule, things started to happen. I had got the impression from other people that it was a gradual thing and the effects would come on slowly. I think I felt more different than I realised but by the time I was conscious of feeling different, they were really starting to take effect. It felt very sudden. This is what weve christened the hang on moment.  Where you suddenly realise that youre really not that straight in the head all of a sudden.
