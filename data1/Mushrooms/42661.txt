3.	Loosing track of time now, I am getting profound revelations as my consciousness expands, I get a sense of becoming whole at this point and began to understand what reality is, as it is being given to me through a higher state of consciousness. I close my eyes and feel like I am in an intense dream, I then see white house on a grassy ball I am moving closer and closer to it till I enter the door of the house, upon entering the house I start becoming awake and waking up from the dream.
