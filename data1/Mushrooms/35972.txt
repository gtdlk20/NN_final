Anyway, something else very strange happened later.  As we were coming off the trip, J said his heart was beating really fast, and he thought he may be having a panic attack.  I tried to calm him and ask what I could do to help.  He said he needed to lie on the couch, so I took him to the living room and he laid down.  I sat beside him and felt his heart, it was racing.  I decided to try something even though I had only heard about it and had someone do it to me once, but I never learned how or tried to do it before.  I wasn't even sure what I was doing, but I just got an idea.
