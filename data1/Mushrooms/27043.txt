I couldnt sleep at all and stayed up another 3 hours analyzing what had just happened to me. This was an incredibly terrifying experience but its also an experience I am grateful for. First of all I got to see my Attention Deficit Disorder. I was actually in a world created by its disorder and distraction. Also my reaction to what I thought was death was a pretty strong telltale sign as to how I would react when actually faced with my own mortality.
