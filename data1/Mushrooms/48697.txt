The setting: M's basement, his parents are sound asleep, 11 pm. We each spit the half three ways, I take a little more than T and M. We decide to watch a little Monty Python to loosen things up a little. The lights are dim and we're very comfortable on 3 seperate mattreses. About 45 minutes into the movie, we become quite distracted and we decide to turn it off and play some quiet music on. M decides to put Shpongle in, a nice choice. T is definitely beginning to feel it, as he is laughing uncontrollably. I am being to feel very off baseline and notice that colors are more vibrant and the music is richer.
