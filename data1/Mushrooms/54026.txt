Coming back to my lounge I was wobbling like a drunk person, the trip intensified and I rapidly began to lose myself in a new reality, started to slip back and forth between the intense visuals I was experiencing to short mind journeys like intensely vivid dreams, next thing I remember I feel ill and start barfing but purged barely anything, and then that was that, my trip went off the chart, I experienced multiple other realities each one lasting I think for only seconds, maybe minutes, when I returned from the 'dream' or 'journey', I knew that I was in my lounge  and each time I returned the perception I had was different, this was extremely strange yet enjoyable as the euphoria I felt was off the chart too, I couldn't distinguish between reality  and the visions or dreams I was having, occasionally I would come out of my journey from 'who the hell knows where' and  back to my lounge  and I would every time find myself at one of three locations but with different perceptions and this would absolutely mind f**k me every time, I could try to explain some of the dreams but thats pointless. The only words I can use to explain the experience is as 'astonishing, excellent and bizarre'.
