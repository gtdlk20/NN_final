My boyfriend began to make faces to go along with Treys guitar. I remember watching him and realizing how strange the situation was and how I was completely content and unfazed by the strangeness of it. I was perfectly content to watch him contort his face along with the music. It seemed so beautiful and natural. He turned his attention back to me and we began to talk about us. He said that he didnt know what would happen in our lives but he knows that I am going to be a great mother and that he hopes he can be there for it. I told him that he is going to be a great father and husband and that I felt the same way. It was such a healthy conversation because it was like us both acknowledging the randomness of the future and still being able to fully express our love for each other in that moment.
