One boring summer night, my friend B calls me up and tells me that he's bored and wants to do shrooms.  Normally I would of obliged right away, but being tired from work and having a slight cold, I tell him that it would be better to wait a couple days.  I told him this because I know that mind set and mood influence trips of any kind under any substance.
