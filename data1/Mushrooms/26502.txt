So I probably played guitar for an hour and a half or so, and had tons of fun. After that I was down to a medium ++ and decided to go back online and start raving to some friends about how these were the best mushrooms I ever ate. I felt like I just had an extremely religious and healing experience... and with no anxiety or nausea! I still felt incredibly dank.
