I ate the mushrooms at about 10:45 and washed them down with Monster energy. The others with me decided that we would go to a park to smoke some weed. I was hoping we would get back before they started kicking in. While we walked into the park I began to feel a bit of a body high. My limbs began feeling lighter, starting from my feet and radiating upwards. It eventually became a euphoric numbness that would pulsate throughout my entire body. We reached the point where we were going to smoke and I began feeling it in my head. At first it just felt like I was really high-a numb body and a strange visual perspective of the world. I decided to join my friends who had situated themselves in a tunnel under a bridge and hit the bong with them to ensure a punctuated experience.
