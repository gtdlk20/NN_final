We walked for what seemed like forever, occasionally stopping to let cars pass which filled me with 'oh my god, they know we're high' dread. I was very conscious that I wasn't experiencing euphoria, but I had begun to experience small visual distortions. I could perceive depth more clearly, and houses in the distance looked empty and as though they were part of a pop-up book. We passed so many cows that they began to feel like a farce, as if they weren't real, just some funny prop placed there to make it look like real countryside. My most distinct visual was that the grass looked incredibly fake, as though it was mounds of green sand or sugar rather than blades of grass.
