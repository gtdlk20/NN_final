Finally my friend had finished his thought train, and when he popped his head into the room and I saw a smile on his face, I laughed out loud with joy for him. We talked for the next 3 hours (time slowly made more sense) about all that we had learned about ourselves. That there is nothing in life to be afraid of. I gave my friend my warm blanket as an offering of comfort. He smiled. We talked and talked about it all into the early hours of the morning, me sipping my wonderful juice the whole time.
