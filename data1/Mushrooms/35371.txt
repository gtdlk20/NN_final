My mind had been wrapped around my detox for several weeks and a lot of the trip's head stuff seemed to be about concluding the experience. I felt wide open to the energy of the universe and was very happy to enjoy the visuals I was seeing. The clouds were pulsing with light. The city was alive. The water at my feet was alive. The trees were budding. It was spring and everything was happy and alive. I thought about shamans and ancient people who ate mushrooms and started seeing closed eye visuals reminiscient of ancient aztec civilization.
