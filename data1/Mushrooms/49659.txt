I was in the middle of this when my mind suddenly jumped to something else. It does that. Everything seemed so important and had to be acted on but it was so easy to totally change your direction of thought. I looked next to me, where KT was still sitting and asked her if she was ok. She said that she felt really paranoid. Again, a total change of emotion for me. I went from feeling fantastic to wanting to press myself as low into the ground as I could. Other people can have such a huge effect on your mood. Mushrooms are such an internal drug so its weird that stuff like that happens. I can only liken it to a huge wave breaking on my head. That feeling of sadness Id had earlier came back magnified. I was sitting cross-legged with her to my right. It felt as though there was a wall, running right through me. On the one side was KT, and it was dark and there was a noise like the one you get underwater, a rushing noise. Then to my left, there was light. But my head was turned towards KT ad I actually had to make a huge effort to be able to look away, back into the light, like something was holding my head.
