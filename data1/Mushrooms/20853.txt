The part of me that was able to dialogue with the entities. Unfortunately I was not able to hear through this perspective as it was the awakened inner me, the real me. I was able to listen to the responses of the Inner Me to make sense of what was being said to me. This dialogue with the Inner Me reflects the perspective in the hospital bed including the relative location of my friends and family in relation to my bed but happened mostly after the hospital scenario. During this perspective I am at the left side of my body observing myself, listening to my responses in my bedroom in the dark.
