So after the bath I was still tripping kinda hard a little over 2 hours in. So I sat down to watch Zootopia. Which is a great movie! But after about 35 minutes it was honestly just kind of hurting my eyes and felt like it was taking away from the experience, at least this time. I enjoy watching movies with friends when we do mushrooms but I didnÂ’t find it very preferable while on my own. So I turned it off and grabbed some blueberries and went back into my room. I kinda just sat there with just some nature sounds playing softly on my computer speakers. Definitely got to a bit of thinking. First of all blueberries tasted phenomenal. I would eat them slowly one at a time noticing the flavour difference depending on what size blueberry I ate. Small ones tart large ones sweet lol just dedicated 10 minutes of my life to a deep appreciation for how awesome blueberries are. Blueberries are the answer to life's problems. Could probably achieve enlightenment through blueberries...Well not quite but it felt like that in the moment.
