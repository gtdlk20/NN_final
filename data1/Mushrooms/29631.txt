Around this time I was regaining clarity, but was still confused and hazy I felt like my feet were on the ground and a metaphor came to my mind of the pentagrams. The feet on the ground and the head towards the stars. I was thankful to have come  back into existence and I understood the opposite as death. The powers of death and life are constantly at work within us and in the world. ItÂ’s hard to say which of your actions are your own and come from love, and which stem from a force of fear of death.
