At some point during our time on La Piedra (The Rock in Spanish for you non-bilingual readers, as Matt and I came to call it in our Spanish class) I realized that if any person coming to the river to fish or hangout would be confronted with three apparently insane teenage males in the middle of some sort of lunatic ritual.  They would probably call the police right then and we would be duly arrested.  However, that meant nothing to me.  Police, laws, society all seemed for naught right then.  It seemed silly, really, that some person could approach a fellow human being and lock him away in jail for doing what I was doing.  Then I realized that government, countries, and society in general have all been some sort of weird development in human social growth.  Race, sex, and sexuality were all just ideas that had somehow manifested in  human kinds development-  they had grown from some whim of acceptance and tradition and were eventually established as norms.  How I wished we could be rid of it all!  Human kind and his place on this Earth was so simple, and so many people were wrong about it.
