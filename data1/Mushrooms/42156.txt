Last night I was told being human is the best part, by everyone that used to be human or part of our physical realm. There are no people up there in the higher plane, no god, no memories, no vision, no sound, no senses, only a giant quantum entangled meta-consciousness permeating the entire universe and every dimension. When our brains are highly active we must perturb this field enough to glimpse the face of reality. The next hour or two I pondered even harder and was terrified I would be stuck in this mindset, I walked in a circle up down and around an intersection like, too many times. I saw security cars and police cars multiple times in the same span of time so I was definitely worrying some people, which was also scary. I did not want anyone to worry about me because I felt above it all. Too above. Or I just went crazy for a night.
