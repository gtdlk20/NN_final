The first time I used mushrooms it was basically an acid trip for me, with less visuals and less mental stimulation. I guess I had a threshold dose and had a pretty bad set and setting. I decided to amend this on my second experiment, and made sure my set and setting was optimal (it was) and had a bit more than last time.
