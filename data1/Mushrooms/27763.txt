My friends once more began to hound me to smoke (I had the utensils in my pocket).  I was so far gone that I couldn't even comprehend wanting to do that, but I couldn't communicate with my fellow trippers at all.  One of them just thought I was fucking with him, and after a period of screaming at me, he wrestled me to the ground and got a lighter out of my pocket.  All I could comprehend was that the course of my life was taking me furthur and further away from who I wanted to be, and that there was no hope of stopping the process.  I lay down in the middle of the eucalyptus forest, clutching my guitar to my chest, watching my whole life reeling by me.  I saw my innocent childhood idiocies progress to less innocent idiocies, I saw every time I'd ever done what I knew to be the wrong thing when faced with a choice.  I watched all the porn I had ever seen gradually and cumulatively polluting my mind and spirit.  At some point I rose to my knees and began pitifully crawling, desparately trying to find something to connect my mind with my body.
