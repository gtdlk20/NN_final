I opened my eyes again and saw my first true hallucination.  Out of the green leaf-patterned comforter, came a Spanish Conquistadors humorous face.  The faces colors were morphing from the green leaf texture to a wood grain pattern and then back again.  The face had a big smile hidden underneath a thick mustache and was wearing a Robin Hood style had with a bright orange feather sticking out.  The face slowly advanced toward my own and was soon only inches away.  The face still came nearer and seemed to be less than 1 millimeter away.  I thought I felt something touch my nose, and then darkness.  I blacked out and to this day cannot remember what happened next, although I have a feeling that I was not unconscious for the rest of the night.
