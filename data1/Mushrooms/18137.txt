I have learned from experience that mushroom trips rarely, if ever, end up congruent to pre-trip expectations.  Prime example:  when two good friends and I reached the incredibly beautiful Jolama Beach campsite on a secluded piece of the Pacific Coast with plans to put our respective eights of mush madness to good use, I never expected that only a few short hours from then I would be hanging precariously from a cliff of crumbling rock and screaming desperately to my friends that I didnÂ’t want to die. But such is the nature of psychedelics.
