Once I was comfortable, I allowed myself to be consumed by both synaesthesia and XTC in my Mind by Infected Mushroom. An intense three dimensional city scape unfolded with every tone of the song, and it glittered and realigned itself continually. At first, I was slightly restless. These visuals were beautiful, but should I be spending my time admiring them, or should I go outside? Should I find Yon and Dave? It seemed very absurd that anyone could ever decide on a single thing to do at any moment in time, because all these options seemed equally promising. I realized these conflicting thoughts were unsettling me, and I then decided to enjoy the visuals for now, and do something else if the mood struck me later.
