Then all of a sudden it stopped. A friend tapped me on the shoulder and whisperd to me to wonder if I wanted to go on a short walk through the park that was just down the road. As I walked up stairs, I found it difficult to find my own shoes, some were too big, some were to tight, none looked like mine, every design was different and kept changing. Soon enough I just grabbed any pair that would fit and went on the walk.
