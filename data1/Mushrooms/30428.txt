In preparation for the trip we both decided to pack an adventure backpack.  Wed each just fill it with engaging things that we thought would be fun while tripping.  Im an art major, and shes very into art so both our backpacks were packed full of art making supplies.  In my backpack, I packed a camera, my sketchbook, art books full of pictures, candles, a bouncy ball, a blanket, and (of course) my ipod.
