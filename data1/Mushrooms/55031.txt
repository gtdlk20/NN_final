So one night my bro and I stayed up and I ate the big one and 2 small ones and he just ate 2 small ones. So we waited for the effects for about 25 minutes and we were thinking nothing was going to happen so we waited more and about 45 minutes after we ate them my chest started getting heavy and it was hard for me to breathe. For some reason I still wasnt worried and its a good thing or else I would have had a bad trip.
