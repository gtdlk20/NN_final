During the trip, I tripped out about the relationship between my girlfriend and me. I need to be with someone I can be completely honest with. Ideally, I'd like to be completely honest with my girlfriend, but I definately have issues with that... The other day my girlfriend asked me if I wanted to do mushrooms with her and I said no because I'm too unsure about our relationship.
