The mushroom is seemingly more jolly and kind  but once I've gotten to know it, it can unexpectedly turn into a dark teacher.  With all due respect but to me it feels like a true Trixter entity on the higher doses.  It is all fun and games until I ask it for the truth of the matter and that is when the kaleidoscope of colours and forms is exchanged for pain, angst and doom.  Well, it could be that the mushroom goes straight for the sore spot and the pain or trauma buried within the subconscious.  It exposes ones deepest pain and rubs ones nose in the issue.
