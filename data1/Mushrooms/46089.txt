I decided it was a good idea to turn off the lights and put in the new Animal Collective album Merriweather Post Pavilion on the surround sound system, as I had been listening to it for the past few nights and it's an amazing album. I also turned on the Xbox 360 visualizer for music on a big screen tv, and we all set back into a couch ready to take on the trip. The first track, In the Flowers is an amazing start to such an album, and has a very mysterious feel that coincided with us coming up. It was perfect. It immediately caught everyone's attention, and we were all getting into the music. It was interesting because only two of us were familiar with the album, while everyone else had never even heard of Animal Collective before. I'm sure they won't forget after this night.
