But, oh shit, it is the shrooms isnt it. From the guy storing his shit in a life cereal box. Oh Im getting high on life and it cost me my tongue. Hah, the irony. If only those phony motivational speakers could see me now, living their dream, paying this price. But this isnt about victories and one-ups. Think of your safety man, what about your eyes. What sense organ will be the next to go oh and there are knives everywhere. Theyre inescapable, a part of this environment, pleasure and pain go hand and hand, pride yourself on not being a cutter or an emo but thosere the facts Jack. You need someone to help you to to make sure you dont fuck yourself up again. Thats prescience boy, youre a regular sage, you are, always know what to do. Well fuuuuck, get in the back of the trunk.
