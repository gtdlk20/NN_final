After a while of playing in Spencers we went back out into the main mall area. We spotted Diana and Vicky and ran over to say hello. Lisa and me were so excited to see them. I had to pee, so Diana went with me to the bathroom to make sure I didnt get lost. I did what I had to do and then flushed the toilet (like everybody does) but when I flushed I noticed it sounded funny so I turned around and flushed it over and over laughing hysterically every time. I came out of the bathroom sometime later and looked in the mirror. ooo boy was that ever a big mistake. As I gazed at my reflection, I could see the veins in my face and I noticed that my skin was so red looking. I could see every little imperfection and flaw in my skin. It didn't bother me that much but I thought I looked so nasty and sick-like. I backed away from the sink and leaned against the wall by the hand dryers while I waited for Diana. As I was leaning against the wall one of the hand dryers came on. It scared the shit out of me and made me leap to the other side of the bathroom; it seemed so sudden and loud. But then I chilled out cause I remembered that they were automatic and that this one wasn't trying to get me. Diana was laughing at me so hard cause she said I was being so bugged out and funny. She said I was in a world of my own and I was loving it. Which I was. After my time in the bathroom we walked back to Spencers to meet up with the rest of our crew.
