When they left I decided to spend some time with nature and went outside and just lounged around the yard and then went for a short walk around the block, just to take in the beauty of the place that I loved, but for so many reasons felt like I hated. I also smoked another joint. The sky was beautiful that night, with many colored lights streaking the sky. When I got home I was really tripping (and getting cold) so I cranked up the music and let the trip flow. I started to remove all of my clothing, almost a 'spiritual striptease' because I wasn't exactly being seductive, I was admiring my own beauty of the temple of my body and appreciating it's every line and curve. I was peeling away the tight restrictive 'uniform' or the front that I put on everyday, and became bare, became me.
