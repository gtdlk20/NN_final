I arrived at the mall with S at about 4pm. I grabbed a coca-cola from a vending machine and walked to a deserted part of the hall that was like an emergency exit no one goes out. I pulled out the bag of mushrooms I had got the day before and started in just eating the dried fungus washing it down with some soda. S wasn't interested but didn't object to me eating them, just got kind of nervous when I ate the whole bag, I reassured him that it wasn't a lethal dose, a higher dose but reminded him of the many drugs I've done before and how I'd researched and got the facts before, he smiled and told me to enjoy my flight, I promised him I would.
