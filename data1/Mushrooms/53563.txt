I thought, 'I'll go towards the light, white light,' and these beginnings of caverns were forming in front of my eyes, of blue, and pink and orange color.. I searched for the white light, and found it.. I dove in and the caven changed into tunnel made of turquose rings of light, I sped through them, towards the white light, rings grew quickly paler and suddenly I felt very weird - awed sort of, bit scared if I should do this, or jus t open my eyes - I had lost the feel of my body and was completely away in the spiritworld.. I hesitated for a microsecond and then continued while thinking 'Don't think. Think nothing. Thinki pinki.' [ =) ] - and suddenly was there -
