We were a little impatient because the weekend was taking forever to come, so at 12 noon on thursday, we take the pills.  2 each at first.  We stock up on food and take showers before the effects start to kick in.  I notice the effects within 30 minutes though my roommate doesn't report anything yet, just a little disorientation.  I look down at the carpet in my dormroom and notice a well-defined 'breathing'.  I was overjoyed that the batch of shrooms we acquired were not duds.  The white cement wall also starts to breathe and the clothes in the closet start to change color as the shadows cast on them start to move.  I was quite involved with all of this and spend what seemed like a lengthy amount of time staring at the liveliness of our normally plain dormroom.
