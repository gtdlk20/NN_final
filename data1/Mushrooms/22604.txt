I had waited for a pristine time to do them, and what better time in my opinion than the night of New Years Eve. I am writing this as I wait for the shrooms to start kicking in. I had just a night before taken 50mg of Seroquel for my insomnia, but had refrained today because I take it as a sleep aid and was determined to trip instead. I know Seroquel can affectively stop a psychedelic trip, such as those from LSD, from occurring any longer in duration, appearing to be a sudden drop in symptoms. Quetiapine (Seroquel) and Psilocin/Psilocybin are medicines/drugs that both target the receptors of Serotonin and Dopamine. Specifically for Seroquel, the D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are antagonized, the alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, and 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 serotonin receptors. Psilocin targets the Serotonin receptors and acts as a potential agonist instead. By some peoples notes, the effects seem to cross each other out.
