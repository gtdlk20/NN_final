I am a 27 year old male working for the British governement, I have two young sons and a partner of 7 years. I had taken psilocybe mushrooms several times before but only in Amsterdam. Now being lucky enough to live in England where currently a loophole in the law allows the legal sale of FRESH psilocybe I decided to mark my 28th birthday with a camping 'trip'.
