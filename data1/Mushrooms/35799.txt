I felt as though I had entered an alternate universe, or found the entrance to one.  I turned my head to left, and passed through the same invisible force-field, to see nothing.  Where my sister, Y, and Z should have been, there was nothing but the empty room.  I felt a faint impression of Z propped against the desk, but nothing I could see with my eyes.  I quickly snapped my head right and snapped back to the left.  They had returned.  My sister was sitting quietly next to me as though nothing was wrong.  Z was still slouched over and grinning.  Y was still looking furtive and uncomfortable.  Exactly how I left them.
