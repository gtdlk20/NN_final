After taking the miniscule dosage of 1 gram we spoke some more. Afterwards  I decided 1 gram was going to do nothing to me after the epic experience I had the week prior on 5 grams, so I decided to take a walk for air, alone. It was a short walk. I barely made it 15 feet from my apartment building when I stared at a tree across the street. It was about nine at night, and a fair amount of folks walking about. The tree for some reason caught my attention. It was in front of a library and the trunk was surrounded by a fence. It was probably 20 feet tall and rather un-extraordinary. I was FAR from tripping on such a low dose yet my attention was drawn by a potent intuition to look at the tree. As I did, I began to appreciate nature and thought of Mother Earth, the tree began to sway from a strong breeze, and then it happened.
