It all started out when me an my best friend (Lets call him E) got the idea to eat some mushies. E had tried them before and said that he felt like a god. So naturally I was compelled to try them too. After alot of contemplating about what could go wrong, what I shouldnt eat, should eat, what to think about, and what not to think about. I have been preparing for this for like three days not doing anything that would get me depressed during the trip. He ate an eight and I ate a sixteenth.
