For growth medium, I use birdseed without sunflower seeds for P. cubensis.  It's easy to sterilize because it's smooth without a lot of nooks and crannies for bacteria to grow in, plus it's easier to shake apart later.  This is important, because once you have a jar or two of healthy uncontaminated mycelia, you can use them to inoculate at least ten jars each of fresh growth medium.  Once the mycelium has completely saturated the growth medium, transfer it to a larger container for growing.  At this point, sterile technique is no longer required as the mycelia generates its own fungicides which keep other contaminates from growing.  Use an open box or carton so you can easily get to the mushrooms when they sprout.
