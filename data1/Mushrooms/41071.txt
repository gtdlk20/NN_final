I am spark in the night. The lost longing for light. I am gloworm, firefly, luminous mushroom, flashes in the waves. I am bioluminescence in the night. I am hollow of darkness. Marked in space by reverie. The place between. The inevitable eventuality. The interstices. The magnetic hollow of infinite free light.
