Picked up a mirror and found that if I stared at my reflection that half of my face looked as if it was melting away. One half would remain youthful, the rest would slowly dissolve into mush. After fooling around for another half hour with the mirror I started feeling really sick. Went upstairs to the bathroom, but by this stage I could feel it coming on really strongly and my thoughts were becoming very very irrational indeed.
