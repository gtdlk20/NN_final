So with determination in hand I lead the way out of the woods and towards the car. My little camping spot is out of the way like I said so there was some bush wacking involved to get out. I remember kind of laughing and having to like re-ground myself every couple of seconds. We got out of the bog section over the main trail and back towards my car through another wooded section.
