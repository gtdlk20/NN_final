My mate had been investigating a tree but when he came back over I grimly informed him of the grassÂ’s plans to kill us. He said he was aware of their plans and that we should move on. I went down to the river and tripped out on the ripples, which seemed to be forming and endless spiral across the water, which now looked more like a mirror. We contemplated walking across this mirror to the other side, but then decided that it would probably trick us by turning out to be water after all. We moved on.
