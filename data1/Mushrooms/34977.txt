I came to some serious revelations about my life, and after I started coming down and everything slowly went back to normal, I felt calm, happy... 'zenful.'  I had realised I was a being that was full of conflict and hatred, no matter how much I endorsed being positive and peaceful in the past.  I wasn't living out beliefs very well, and this trip completely changed that.  I don't feel the same way I did after I came down off the trip, I'm my old self, no more light shining off my skin because of the amazingly good of vibes I was giving off, but I can now stay away from arguments and fighting and be more open with myself and others.  I've always been a social butterfly, but this actually has helped me renew certain relationships that had been falling apart, particularly with some family members.  Thank you, almighty mushrooms.
