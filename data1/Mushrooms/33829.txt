T 0:00  10:25PM: the meal begins. I have split the 5g into quarters. 1.25g are in each baggy. I put the stems and caps in my mouth and chew them up. I dont mind the taste at all and actually find it nicer than normal mushrooms one would eat. I then place the powders at the bottom of the baggy in my mouth and chew it all for about 2 minutes and then suck on the pulp for 10 minutes. I swallow. I then wait and watch TV for 20 minutes.
