The visuals of the concert were out of this world. This was really great. I saw Dionysus, aliens and a twenty years younger Fripp to name just a few of a couple of million transformations that appeared in the box. My friend told me afterwards that for him the images of the concert went out of the television box and filled everything. For me it stayed in the box, the box was part of THE ROOM, THE ROOM was important, the concert was interesting.
