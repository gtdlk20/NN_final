These were the strongest shrooms I've ever had.  I have been told the difference between shrooms and LSD is that on shrooms you know are hallucenating.  On LSD, you can't tell yourself that.  The shrooms I had truly enlightened me.  I couldn't tell what was real, fake, or anything.  The only things that I know really happened that night was we left and arrived.  Everything else was just giant crazyness.  It was great.  I'd most definately do that again, and again, and again.
