Soon after that I started panicking once again, there was now no way back. I messaged a couple of friends and my brother. I found no response anywhere, so I accepted my fate. My hands started growing numb because of the panic and I wasnt sure how to tackle the come up. I spent some time doing a last minute study into some texts, kinda like what one would do before an exam one has gone uprepared to.
