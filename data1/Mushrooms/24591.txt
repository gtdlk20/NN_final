Two months after this experience I have been able to tell how this event has changed me as a person.  This trip seemed to awaken me to the real world and complete my transformation into an adult.  I am much more receptive to new ideas and more observant of the world around me.  Whenever I meet someone I analyze their entire personality and link it to their eye color and appearance just like I did during the trip.  This new outlook on life has definitely been a positive event in my lifebest night of my life so far.
