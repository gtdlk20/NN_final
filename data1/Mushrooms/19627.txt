After this rejection phase, I come back to some ordinary concept I can control. This gives me back a sense of self confidence. But on one hand I'm sorry for the end of the trip. Thoughts start calming down, even if sometimes I have glimpses of alteration. I try to exploit them at best, going back to visions. I stare at my hand again, I get lost in the lines on the palm, that change colour and define spaces. There's a rectangle filled with iridescent lines that seems soft and pulsing. Then the hand fills the visual field as a planet surface. The back of the hand has all the tendons tight, it seems a dead hand. After this last vision I get back to ordinary reality. Me and my soulmate start talking in a logical way, trying to remember the first details of our own trip. It comes the hunger. We eat some crisps with apple juice, and it was the tastiest thing in the world.
