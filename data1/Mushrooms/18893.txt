Normally, it is impossible for me, as well as most that I know, to sleep while influenced by psychedelic substances. Its simply something that cannot be forced. This time however, I lost myself. I went into what I would call a trance. For it was as if I was dreaming, but my entire self was there. It must be what people experience during lucid dreaming. I do not remember much of it, but I will tell you what I can. The first thing that I saw was a very bright light coming from everywhere. I also remember some blues in the background after the light subsided a little, but the light was always present. I do not have any sequence of time for these events but there are images that are quite vivid in my head.  Soon I was somewhat introduced to two characters. There were definitely more of them but these are the two that I can remember.
