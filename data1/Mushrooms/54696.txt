Soon, I became overwhelmed with a feeling of having 'to get out of here'. It was completely dark and we hadn't seen Luke or Danny in hours.  I said my goodbyes to Steve and ventured into the forest alone.  It didn't take long before I met back up with my other friends.  They had forgotten to take a flashlight with them and had been running, acutally running!, through the forest in near total dark for the past hour trying to get back to camp.  The group was whole again I was feeling a hell of a lot better.
