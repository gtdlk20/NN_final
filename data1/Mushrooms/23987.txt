Every word that filtered through to me from the rugby commentators, however trivial, rang with a profound veracity that sent shivers down my spine, and it was all I could do to stop myself from running over to the TV and stroking it in fascination. Instead I curled up on my side and allowed the visuals to take over completely. Soon I was covered from top to bottom in flowing bands of living textiles, whose snake-like tongues extended toward me and seemed to investigate my paralysed face. I could feel a faint, faint breeze from the air around me being gently stirred by the textilesÂ’ movements. I felt on some level as though I should feel afraid, or at least concerned, but instead I sensed only curiosity from these half-creatures.
