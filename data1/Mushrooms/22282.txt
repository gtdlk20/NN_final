After some time I stepped out into the sun, the sun had this awesome presence, it was warm and powerful, a God like figure.  Scott stepped into the sun with me as Jeff walked a bit of a ways down a hill.  He noted how amazing the warmth felt, Kevin mention how cold he was in the shade so we invited him into the sun with us, he shouted out how wonderful it felt to stand in the sun and we all shared smiles and laughs.  We then sat down and I looked around me.  The scenery had definitely changed, nothing seemed to sit in space as it normally would, and nothing was stationary.  I laid back and closed my eyes.  Instantly I saw a rush of geometric flowing orange, yellow, and red patterns behind my eyelids.  It was amazingly beautiful and I was awe struck.  I began to see images of the Buddha, and I believe someone mentioned something about Jesus as I felt and saw the presence of Jesus, Buddha, and other unidentified figures. I then heard the scream of a hawk and opened my eyes.  The scream filled my ears and the entire valley with a reverberating echo; it was absolutely gorgeous, and so primitive.
