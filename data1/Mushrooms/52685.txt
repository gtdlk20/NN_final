The humidifier and light cycle via inexpensive timers.  I found that a 12-hour on/off cycle for the lights worked fine.  Remember to be sure the light in shining on all surfaces you intend to try to pin. The humidifier was on a 1-hour on/off cycle.  This is with the humidifier on the LOWEST or almost lowest setting! I cannot say this is the best way to do it, but it worked very well for me.  Besides, Walmart timers cannot be set for any resolution less than one hour.
