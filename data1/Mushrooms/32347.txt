About a year ago I took an extremely heavy dose of psychedelic mushrooms. Since then, there hasn't been a day that I haven't thought about what happend to me on this day, which became one of the most frightening, and unexplainable 'experiences' in my life. I'm not sure if anything, or anyone could have prepared me for it. I had done mushrooms, 15-20 times before this, but never had anything like this.
