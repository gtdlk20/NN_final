It went like that for about 2 hours, me sitting in the living room, taking in my surroundings and sensing so many things at once that i felt i had to get out; although i was the only one in the house, i felt i had to get out. My sudden claustrophobia caused me to jump out of my recliner and to the screen door, i rushed out the door as if not getting away from something anymore, but magnetized toward something. I felt myself walk along the lakeside not exactly sure of where i was going, but positive that i was going somewhere. My instinct told me just to keep walking.
