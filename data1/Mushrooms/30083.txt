Brother Logos and his initiators treasure a nearby state-park granite mountain -- An ancient bubble of Magma that cooled hundreds of millions of years ago into a massive above-ground loaf of bare rounded granite, 1000 feet high, and 5 miles in circumference.  While the front-side has been carved into a prominent tourist attraction unsuited for psychedelic journeys, there is a hidden route around the back, away from tourists - partially off-limits, and paradoxically preserving some of the best of the park by its undeveloped state and reservation for generators and equipment down at the base.  Exposed tilted plains of granite skirt that base in rising slopes, creating a unique micro-ecology of shallow rain-pools of reflected sky, pale green lichens almost painted on the rock surface like living paisley, and clinging Cacti hugging the rock under direct sun.  Surprisingly soft sponge-like mosses hold water in the shadows of vertical dormant quarry walls.  Dotting the wide expanses, before the rise becomes too vertical, are sparse islands of trees - so plentiful below the mountain -- in shallow pans of root-hoarded dirt.  The hidden path winds and climbs past these few features to rise beyond painted off-limits lines, over or under a raised power conduit that feeds the sky-trams on the other side, to a quiet niche on the bald round mound called the Eagles Nest.  This small scoop of rest into the steep granite overlooks a wide quiet view of forested valley and lake, nestled down below.
