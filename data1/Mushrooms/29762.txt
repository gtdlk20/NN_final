But over those years I have had bouts with minor depression, short periods of deep introspection and doubt accompanied by feelings of purposelessness. Yet, I am also a committed Christian and have accepted that these episodes are my thorn in the flesh and I try to mature from them. Having certain gifts often entails certain deficits. Besides, these short periods of depression are not debilitating and, in fact, are often followed by surprising bursts of energy and creativity.
