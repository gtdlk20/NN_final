Time was a complete mystery to me at this point. I felt as if I had been tripping for days but it was only a couple of hours. Im not sure how late it was when Mike called her again. This time she sounded really bad, and he tried for a long time to get any kind of response from her other than uh huh. The next day, she stopped by to get some stuff she left in my room and she told me she had had a horrible trip. I really think environment is what determines the enjoyment of your trip. I was surrounded by good friends and we were all laughing and talking and having a great time. She was alone in her dorm room, thinking and doing god knows what. The fact that I had an awesome time was definitely 100% to do with the good environment.
