I guess I should start by saying a little about myself. This trip took place about a year ago. I come from a christian family that attends church regularly. From a young age the religion never resonated with me. I was always the black sheep out of all my siblings. I was the first child to get into cannabis and sometimes alcohol. Finding my way to the world of altered states of consciousness come very naturally to me.
