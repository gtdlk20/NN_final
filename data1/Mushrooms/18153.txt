Finally, finally I made it to the top, to blessed stable horizontal ground. Now it was Matts turn to make the final climb and I could imagine his death just as vividly as mine.  However, he made it up rather easily with my help and we three stood triumphant on top of the cliff that we had conquered.  How joyous it was!  I was a dirty, disgusting looking disheveled mess but I felt so damn good about the climb and overcoming my fear that I just didnt give a damn.
