The after effects were quite weird and lasted for the rest of the day.  We sat in my tent with the most weird converstaions I have ever participated in.  Every now and again I would get these little rushes that made me excited I was coming back up, but as soon as they begun they finished.  Eventually I went to sleep and did not dream.
