When I got downstairs though I decided to have a shower and man that felt soooo good. I'm not sure why I don't have more showers man, they're awesome. But yea, no real spiritual insight as of right now I figure. I wanted an adventure though, and that's what I got more or less. From zoning out high in my chair in the pouring rain, to trying to figure out how to get through the bog high. Sitting by the pond extremely disoriented, sitting in the car laughing my ass off and dopely walking around the woods on the come down trying to make sense of it all.
