It was soon after that the most amazing thing happened to me.  I was sitting on the right side of my sister's bed.  Y, Z, and my sister formed a sort of triangle; with my sister of the left side of the bed, Z on the floor, and Y on the futon a few feet away from the bed.  The point being that I could look upon the wall to my right without seeing anyone.  I was watching a green murmur, which could have been a peaceful boa constrictor, float across the right wall.  As I turned my head to the left I felt as though I had pulled myself through some sort of invisible barrier.  I was completely alone. There was no one on the left side of the room.  I looked to the right, and as I turned my head I felt it passing through that same invisible barrier.  The room was split in two, and I was sitting directly along the divide.
