I realized my mother had just got home from the Thanksgiving dinner. I was worried and panicy but still tripping. She came in my room and asked why it smelled like smoke we all replied we didn't know, after realizing my mother did not know we were fucked up, me and my friend went and spoke to her.  Still tripping bad, I had fun talking to her and so did my friend.
