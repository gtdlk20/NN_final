We walked back to the hotel. In the parking lot, dude noticed how beautiful the trees were in comparison to the cement and asphalt. I agreed wholeheartedly, and we stood there for some amount of time just staring and commenting on how cool plants are and how they keep their beauty in spite of the shit we place them in. Finally, we entered the hotel again, thru yet another entrance that seemed wholly unfamiliar.
