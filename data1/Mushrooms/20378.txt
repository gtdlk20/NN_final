I went into a dark room and listened to a cd called Euphoria 4. As the music played, I saw snakes coming from underneath the door. I closed my eyes and I saw a pyramid and I saw a jungle overlooking it. I opened my eyes again and I kept seeing more snakes. I got this feeling as I was listening to the music and the next time I closed my eyes, I saw Aztec style art and I let it engulf me. It was a great feeling as if I could let go of everything else and be in a totally different place. I saw neon pink, green, and orange wheels turning with faces all smiling at me. The faces then turned into evil sadistic faces and they all had their features warped: their kind eyes became enlarged, their noses became twisted, and their smiles became gaping mouths full of sharp teeth. This scared me and all of a sudden, I felt a horrible feeling and so then I immediatly opened my eyes.
