Until I woke needing to urinate, I clambered out of the tent and was surrounded by blinding whiteness. I could see no further than the edges of our camp. I felt as though somehow our little chunk of reality had been dislodged by our shrooming and was now floating in emptiness. It wasnt though, it was just the most amazing early morning mist ever.
