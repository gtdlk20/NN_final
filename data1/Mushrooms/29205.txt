After that I had a solid hit of the herb, my only one during the day, and I returned to admiring the dancing and gyrating arabesques and tessellations left behind by an ancient South American culture.  I now remembered that my close-eye adventures started out in a desert and from this point on I had to have water in close proximity.  This was followed by a second capsule of tryptophan and probably 6 or 7 trips to the bathroom to pee, drink more water and then finally a very wakeful kind of sleep.  A lucid dream perhaps but I can't remember.
