T:2:00 ...Oh my god.  I am driving.  I think I'm driving.  What is driving?  If...I'm bad at driving, I might wreck, and that could injure or kill me, right?  No...driving does not matter, whatever that is.  'My problems are the only things that matter' I say as I'm driving down one-way streets the wrong way, running stop signs.
