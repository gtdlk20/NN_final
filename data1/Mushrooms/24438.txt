After watching TV for a bit I looked around the room and was suddenly jerked awake, I felt vibrant, alive and aware of my entire physical body. The friction of blood in my veins, the movement of my diaphragm, the tensing of muscles, the clenching of my heart. I looked down at my hands and was acutely aware of the bones within, I could feel the flesh sliding over the bone internally while my normal sense of external touch was reduced so every thing felt like cold chrome. Moving my hands became a beautiful ballet of stretching sinew and the movement left a purple trail in the air. Amazing.
