Then, one time, I went over to his side.  I looked at his face and he turned and smiled at me and he was satan.  He had been banging his head on the window and had two lumps where horns would be, so they were there as were the fangs dripping blood and the fire in his eyes and also the music.  At one point before I had looked at him sitting among some rocks that appeared to me as piles of dead and bald bodies committing very sinful acts of the flesh.  In his shirt stripes when he became satan were those bodies again, fucking like mad.  Well, I was not scared of this, but actually quite aroused and intrigued and also it set me into a stir of comedy.  I felt associated in no way to either one of these people at this point.  My ex had become a mannequin with a flapping jaw at one point and was now a dripping mushroom candle that I had an amazing urge to 'hop' on top of.  She was dripping all over herself like a candle.  My friend had taken a bag of her belongings and thrown them all over the place.  He was also throwing weeks old tortillas at me with vengeance and I was a raving lunatic.  I could have easily been committed as all of us could have.
