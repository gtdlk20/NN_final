I am not sure how long the past paragraph took out of the roughly two hours I spent on the bed, it could all be an instant or eternity.  I cannot place the memories in a proper timeline. At some point at 15 30, I got up from the bed and dashed towards my computer. It was a synchronous event, as a friend had messaged me at that moment or slightly before. I emerged from this nothingness terrified at the absolute pain of loneliness and fluid inexistence. I had to establish a connection, words did not come easily and what I had to communicate was difficult to express, but at that moment I felt like I had succeeded and that the connection had been formed at that moment I felt like I had succeeded and that the connection had been formed. I was once again alive and connected. I spend the next hour weeping on the floor and in between sending some messages to friends. I had felt this immense pain and was thankful to be once again under the light, I had feelings of equally immense gratitude. Coincidentally, the sounds playing in my headphones were in tune with the moment, and were songs inspiring unity.
