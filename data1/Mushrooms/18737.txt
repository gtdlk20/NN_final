I guess the puzzle piece analogy comes to mind again.  This psychedelic therapy was slightly useful, helpful, beneficial (whatever word you want to use). Yet it is only one piece of the larger puzzle of self care and life treatment. For the therapeutic effects to have a chance at lasting I need to be sure to keep up with the other puzzle pieces. For the therapeutic effects to have a chance at lasting I need to be sure to keep up with the other puzzle pieces.  And for me those other puzzle pieces are daily Mindfulness sitting (MBSR), daily Journaling, regular exercising, continued devotion to my Higher Power and practice of my religious tradition, eating a fairly healthy diet, having healthy sleep patterns, listening better to my wife, knowing my limits, working through hard events and feelings in the journal, and increasing my self awareness - of feelings, emotions, reactions, thoughts.
