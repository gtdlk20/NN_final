Also while on the bus I can remember talking to Lisa about how I felt as if my high was slowly fading. I was so upset at the fact that I knew it was ending. She agreed with me on this. So we both sat there trying to make ourselves bug out so we would feel like we did before. It seemed to work but we still couldn't fight the fact that in a few hours it would all end.
