So there you have it. That's just about everything I can say about the mushroom growing process. All of this information is first hand, and is as accurate as possible. I hope you found it informative, especially if it helps you to decide to try it yourself. Although growing is not totally effortless, it's certainly not as difficult as some people who post on the net make it out to be. Personally speaking, the project cost us about $150 CAN, and since we've already consumed 20 doses at $10/dose, it has already paid for itself within 2 months.
