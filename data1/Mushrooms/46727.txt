After this the rides we went on seemed part of normality, it didnt really occur to us that we were at a theme park anymore or that we were on rides. The last ride we went on was called Rita, Queen of speed, an extremely fast rollercoaster, however whilst queuing for this ride we had both begun to come down. The kind of slow gentle come down which is fairly enjoyable, although by this point we wanted to go home and chill out. The ride itself was quite good although not as fun as previous rides due to the come down setting in. After this we started to make our way back to the car. On the monorail back to the car park there was a couple sat with us whom I didnt realise were real, then M preceded to talk loudly about what drugs we had taken during the day, in order to play with the couple. The couple seemed quite anxious to get off the monorail and to put as much distance between us and them as possible.
