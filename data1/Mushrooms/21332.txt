After some time has passed, I finally can feel what the trip did for me. It wasnÂ’t an erasing of empathy but quite the opposite. What this mushroom trip ultimately gave me is a healthy disconnection from people (their judgments, the insecurities they triggered in me), but a much deeper, more profound connection to humanity.
