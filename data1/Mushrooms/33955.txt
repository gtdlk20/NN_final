About two and a half hours into our journey, I realized something very strange and startling. Merc and our other friend were having a conversation with one another in the corner of the room. As I was sitting comfortably on the bed, I had noticed that besides my two friends and I, we werent alone. I noticed three bodies or silhouettes doing something to me, or my head. Now let me explain in detail how these beings came across. I have had many psychedelic experiences of contacting alien beings from other dimensions but all of the beings I have encountered before had a physicality to them. That they were made of physical bodies. These three beings however, didnt have a physical body. Instead, they were made of a fluidlike ethereal shadow that diffused in and out of sight within the holographic nature of empty space. It seemed as if what I was seeing was their spirit bodies and their physical bodies were possibly somewhere else in the universe. Although they lacked physicality I could still make out of soft edges of what theyre bodies looked like. They were not spirits from this world but definitely alien.
