The oasis was quite pleasant, and in due time absorbed the initial load of fear with its hidden offerings of beauty!  Surrounded by a half dozen small trees and a 6 foot vertical wall where a quarry cut out blocks of granite a century ago, it was flat, and now sheltered a shallow reflecting pool of water, edged by a 4 inch thick spongy carpet of cool moss which oozed water at the touch.  Delightful!  It felt like I was ticking the whole mountain.  I let Logos talk as I slowly mastered my sense of Nausea, drank water and peed:  I knew I would not puke.  Last time we were here, we rolled upon these grasses! said Logos, remembering past trips here with his psychedelic family.  Seeing the mosses absorb and release their water, I felt I had kicked-started a successful sweat cycle and would not overheat.  While I still felt some manageable discomfort in my body, I felt this as the Spirit of the Mushrooms at work strengthening my body to become much healthier in the long run.  As we gathered our strength for the present climb,  I declared aloud Here is Where I Hear the Echoes of a Future Silence.  I did not know exactly what I meant, or if indeed I meant it or if the Mushroom had spoken it, but just that I must say it, and was certain it would become revealed to me at a later time.  I thank the Spirit of the Mushrooms for making me Stronger! I declared as I put on my pack, and it was so.  I was excited again.  Logos spoke We can climb whenever you are ready.  I saw the imposing rise of 1000 feet rising up like a wall in the background, and replied,  The Spirit of the Mushrooms is moving through us up the Mountain!  I think it will draw us upward.  Where is the Eagles Nest?  Logos pointed a little over half-way up, It is there above that island of trees.  Oh, that is not so far!  I replied, and we set out again under the direct sun, stepping now directly upward against the slope.
