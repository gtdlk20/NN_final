About a year ago, my university decided to suspend me for a year for my bad grades. I had spent four years in a bachelors degree I didn't like, only to complete about half the credits needed to graduate. As each year had gone by, my grades got worse and worse, my interest in the field grew smaller and smaller, I gained about fifty pounds, I smoked more and more weed, did worse and worse with the ladies, and my hope of graduating and becoming somebody grew smaller and smaller. Them suspending me was one of the best things that could have happened. I decided to change my field of study, and was fortunately accepted (on probation) at another university. This past year i've been getting As and Bs (and one C). I've put down the pipe quite often because I'm interseted in what I'm studying and I like putting time into it, i've lost a little weight, and i've even been out on a couple of dates with some really attractive girls. In almost all aspects, my mindset was very healthy for a little mushroom trip.
