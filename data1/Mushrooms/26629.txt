So we pulled up to her house went inside.  I was excited because I was nearly done with my pipe case that I was sewing.  I like making cases for all my pipes, One. It gives them a personal touch, and Two. It further protects them from damage.  So Im sitting on her bed no longer then five minutes, shes working on a homework assignment on her computer and her mom walks in with a very angry look on her face.  On a side note, her mom is another hopelessly misinformed United States citizen who has so many negative prejudices about drugs and the culture I could fill a book with them.  Also, she tends to truly HATE all who are affiliated.  Its Ironic that her daughter is one of them.  She smugly says, Ive called some gentlemen to come down and talk to you guys about your little drug scheme (she points to the closet).  We say, What scheme?  Not denying what the equipment is for, but we truly were not planning on growing any mushrooms, at least not until a far later time in our lives.  Like when weve moved out of this drug bust/prosecution crazy country.  She coldly says, Well you can just tell that to the gentlemen.  I worriedly say, Who exactly did you call?  She replies, with an almost evil and definitely haughty expression, The gentlemen are from the DEA.
