But four men fighting? How queer. How out of place in the back of a truck, and so small and vivid. but shit, something isnt right, somethings off, horribly off, its not right, outside, get outside, containment is contrary to your nature, you are an animal, you long for open plains. Look around A fireplace, some spaghetti and sauce in a pot and in plates scattered randomly, well maybe not randomly, there are forces, equations, perhaps theyre scattered in a Poisson distribution. Youre no statistician though, scratch that.
