Some random thoughts to conclude: I feel that taking entheogens seriously and treating them as sacraments (as I do) can increase the severity of a bad trip, as one believes that they can reveal the truth to an extent (otherwise one might just dismiss certain thoughts as being drugged-out thought). This was certainly the case for this trip. However, this mindset also increases the potential rewards  bad trips can be worse, but good trips can also be much better and more meaningful. It is clear to me that while approaching entheogens seriously may increase the risk of a bad trip (although others might say the opposite), this approach also increases the spiritual and personal gains of psychedelic use and allows one to learn from almost any type of trip (good, bad, social, solo, day, night, etc). Also, preparation and sober integration of the experience are essential for making the journey a beneficial one.
