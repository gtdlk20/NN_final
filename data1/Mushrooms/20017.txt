At this point, I decided that the dark aura of the hallucinations had been brought upon by the darkness, and so I went back to my computer. I felt slightly better here, but the hallucinations got severely more intense than before. The darkness that engulfed the eerie electronic glow of my computer screen would suddenly seem especially dark, only to slowly mutate into a spectacle of dim light, and back again. This slow, back-and-forth hallucinatory property was constant in all manner of visual hallucinations, and when I peaked they would infiltrate auditory hallucinations, even my very fucking thoughts.
