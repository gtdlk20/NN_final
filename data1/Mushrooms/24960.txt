A note apperas out of context here: 'I can't see that he is tripping if I didn't know about it before. Acts normal, pupils fine, doesn't stagger. But when he starts talking he sounds so fucked. Starts a sentence and forgets to finish it. Mumbles, stares at the wall for long periods of time and says it's staring him back.'
