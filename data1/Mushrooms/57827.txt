I awoke in a moving car, and I had to stop the driver so I could get out and puke.  I was scared, nervous, full of anxiety and fear.  I had no idea where I was, what had happened to me, and why I saw all those people in a ballroom.  I later found out that I started screaming for everything to go away, for the trip to stop.  I found out that I had vomited 4-5 times, and that my friends (god bless their souls) had taken care of me the entire night.  I have never been in a situation that has scared and scarred me as much as that one time of taking shrooms. I have not done them since, although I have had many opportunities.  Waking up in a ballroom when I thought I was at a rave, its a scary thing.  I didn't know where I was, who I am, and what has happened to me.
