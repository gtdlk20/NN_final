Then about 40 to 50 minutes into the trip, while watching the movie, my mom came up the stairs to hang up some laundry to dry. Now I'm usually capable of having a regular conversation with my parents or at least not having them notice anything about my tripping, but I still couldn't help feeling paranoid. Anyway, my mom went back to bed, and I didn't say a word to her, nor did she talk to me. I just kept focussing on the movie I was watching, deeply analyzing the characters, and their dialogues. Very interesting thoughts occurred to me while doing this the entire movie, but now they're really just quite a blur in my memory.
