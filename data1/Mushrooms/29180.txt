In a similar way this 'alien' set of experiences seemed to constitute a kind of 'mind'.  Giving it a personality seems human and therefore limited, a futile attempt to capture the sublime.  Something like taking a handful of water from the incredible vastness of the ocean and calling it 'ocean'.  My own experience made complete sense as a kind of '2D slice' into this '3D meta-object'.  I was gazing into this library as much as it was gazing into me.
