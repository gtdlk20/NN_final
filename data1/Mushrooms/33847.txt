T + 4:30 Â– It was nearly 3:00AM and I needed sleep. I clean up all the crap I had changed and turned off the music. I actually expected to be getting some sleep. I sat in bed, looking out the window into a new world. A world of promise, a world of life and a world so meaningless it hurt. I finally drifted into sleep around 4:30AM. I was so exhausted and felt so uncomfortable, it was all worth it.
