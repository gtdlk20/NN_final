Once in a while somebody would speak up. Zulian had made it clear he wasnt going to dose with us, but was more than happy to sit for us. Occasionally I would pipe-up, stating one or two things that I had learned about the drug over the course of my research which I felt may be beneficial for them to know before heading into the experience, but these feeble attempts at conversation were usually greeted with little enthusiasm or response as each of our minds raced, all far too caught up in our own thoughts. After a long time, Peter finally came to the decision that he would do a small dose of the drug if I did some too. I agreed, stating we could always eat more mushrooms later on if we really wanted to, however thats not entirely true. Like a lot of other psychedelics, tolerance builds quickly and so the initial dose is essentially all the user will feel, unless of course they take an outrageous amount.
