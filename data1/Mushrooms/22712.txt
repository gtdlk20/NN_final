Later, I was amazed, as I saw floating past me, a fractal entity. It was symmetrical about the horizontal axis. I have researched a bit what kind of fractal it looked like, and the closest I can come up with is some undescribed variation on the Mandelbrot set, but just a portion, a symmetrical duplication along the x-axis of a fat yet pointy nose-like structure, filled with the very florid and colorful detail characteristic of the Mandelbrot.  But this was absolutely a living fractal, made up of living matter. Was it protoplasm? Some kind of flesh, or a metaphysical living material? I was somehow made to think I had to pay reverence to it as it went by, as though it were some kind of deity.
