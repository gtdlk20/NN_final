We sat there spacing in and out for what seemed like forever, but it must've only been 60 minutes or so, since we listened to most of the CD. There was one song on the CD that had some laughing effects (the artist is a user of hallucinogens himself, so I'm sure that this part of the music was aimed to have this effect) that scared the hell out of both of us, but since we both looked at each other, completely frightened, at the same time, we were able to calm each other down, and after it faded, have a bit of a laugh over this.
