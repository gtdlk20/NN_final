I took the shrooms at about 7:30 PM, chewing them thoroughly and washing them down with Coke to get rid of the nasty taste.  After ingesting, I hung out in a friend's room and watched a Simpsons episode.  I could start to feel it coming on at about 8. I could see a pattern emerging in the linoleum on the floor, and I started laughing because life just seemed happy and funny.  My friends, who were drunk but not tripping, looked at me funny, then went back to watching a Family Guy episode.
