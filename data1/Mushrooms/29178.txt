I had long since (perhaps a year and a half ago) realised and come to terms with my own existence as a collection of memories and unique sets of novel points of view.  Each one of them undoubtedly 'me' but each one just a thin slice at a lower level of organisation.  My own existence can be plausibly explained by my memories and experiences.
