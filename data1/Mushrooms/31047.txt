T:1:00 - Worrying.  That's all I'm doing and nothing can stop me.  I have four things.  I worry about my roomate(for some reason I think he's mad at me for leaving something in the room).  I worry about my ex-girlfriend.  I worry about money problems.  I worry about my test the next day.  At this point, I decide I WILL have a bad trip, because I have too many things to worry about.  Nevertheless, I go to my friend's house and try to act like I'm fine.
