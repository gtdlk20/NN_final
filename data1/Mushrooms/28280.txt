Going deeper and deeper into thought I am able to have a conversation with my conscience, all problems I have with other people are resolved in this conversation. I am able to understand why people chose to do the things they do. We are all born in different places at different times. We are all brought up in different environments, no one person has the same life experiences as the other. These experiences shape us into the humans we are. I lose all grudges I have against people. I now understand that when I get into a fight with somebody because of opposing views, even though I try to prove my point, neither is the right answer. There is no right and wrong. We define right and wrong based on what we are taught it to be, but who's to say that the true right is our wrong and vice versa.
