We could feel the air the river was pushing shaking the bridge. Every now and again, I would feel a blast of energy go straight through me. I could tell it was just the mushrooms comming on stronger. I wasn't even peaking yet, and I could tell it was the most intense trip I was going to have. We smoked a joint and I could tell the joint had a huge affect on my visuals and just the all around feeling through out my body. It hit me so hard I had to go sit down on a bank and brace myself for everything that was just happening, decision making was the hardest, we had everything to go, everywhere to go but we could decide. Everything confused me, it put a fear in my eye which made my mind race so fast.
