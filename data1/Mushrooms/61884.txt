I walked home and lied on the couch. I fell in to a coma like stage. I could hear things, but yet I couldn't respond or react to it. My girlfriend was trying to get me up and talk to me but I couldn't. She started trippin out and my mom came home. Then my body responded to things again. I was trying to talk to my girlfried but her eyes were where her mouth should be but her mouth were where her eyes should be. I got mad confused so I talked to the ceiling.
