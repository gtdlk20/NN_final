A little background on me, I am not this crazy psychonaut, nor take a lot of substances, before this experience I've only taken LSD two times (150ug and 300 ug) and shrooms also two times (1.5 grams and 2.0 grams). This was that experience that people usually say 'I need to level up my dose and see what happens'.
