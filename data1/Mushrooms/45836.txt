I wanted to share this with others, It's been plaguing my mind non-stop.  I'm considering speaking with a therapist, except that I honestly feel like I interacted with a spirit or something similar...maybe even my deceased brother-in-law.  If anyone else has ever experienced something like this...you are not alone.
