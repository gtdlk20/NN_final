I noticed something on my right. What was it? I couldnt work it out. I turned my head to see and realised it was my jumper. I found this extremely funny and whaled with laughter. This sent tears of joy running down my face. Why? I dont know. It was only a fucking jumper! My laugh turned into a hysterical scream! A scream of a mad man.
