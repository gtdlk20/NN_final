I directed my reading lamp to point at my ceiling and lay back. The ceiling instantly had me in awe. It was like a festival for my senses. t was like a festival for my senses. I could see characters, landscapes, demons, children, animals all at once. Psychedellic waves and ripples in the wood swirled and pulsed with energy, I felt as if I was viewing its life force and I felt it was viewing me. Watching me, holding me, somehow. In particular an old crone of a woman with one eye was staring at me. Suddenly I couldn't bear to look at her any longer. I rolled over and instead into the wall closest to my bed and found myself hypnotized by one particularly trippy panel. Its waves started about a quarter inch from each other but evenly got closer and closer until they seemed to create depth in the wood. Suddenly it was as if I stepped up in the trip. I felt my mnd, eyes, senses become pulled into this psychedellic pattern. It was beautiful. I felt as if I could see into the wood for miles, under it, inside it. It had depth. I'm looking at the panel right now, it's funny. It's not moving anymore. But I remember what I felt and saw gazing into it.
