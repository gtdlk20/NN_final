At the gates of the festival I managed to fish out $20 from my wallet, getting $5 in change. We walked a few feet in and found a spot to plant ourselves. I was really tired and unmotivated to do anything so I simply threw the blanket down for myself. I almost sat on it until someone took it from me and proceeded to unfold it for everyone else. I was glad that I didnt have to do anything because frankly, I was incapable. We sat down and began to listen to the music, someone commented on our location as a dead spot and how the music couldnt be heard very well. I didnt care.
