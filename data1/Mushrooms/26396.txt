Early on in the summer I experienced three days of psychosis due to accidentally ingesting a medium-large dose of methamphetamine (disguised as MDMA pills, they turned out to be half and half) along with 7 strong hits of LSD. For three sleepless days I lived the life of a paranoid schizophrenic, and following that 'trip' I was left in a bad sort of depressed / anxious funk.
