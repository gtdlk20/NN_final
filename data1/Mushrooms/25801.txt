Yet I must acknowledge that the route solely taken through meditation is much safer.  The mushroom, along with activating hidden powers, brings me to a realm of other powerful forces that can do much harm.  The mushroom trip must be synergized with the ability to meditate.  I continue to seek to understand the relation between this world of higher entities and enlightenment.  Earlier in my shrooming career (ha!) it seemed as if the mushrooms only hyperactivated my own potentials, such as allowing me to reach virtuosic levels of meditation, and compose tear-jerking guitar melodies on-the-spot.  But this interaction with the Overmind, or the Other, brings a whole other dimension into the experience.  What is this transcendent entity that seems to somehow symbiotically enter itself into this monkeybody of mine and aid in my path of enlightenment?
