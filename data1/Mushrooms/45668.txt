After another 20 minutes I sat up with a sudden rush of fear that overwhelmed me. The whole room illuminated with red green and yellow crystals hanging in mid air. I immediately leaped off my bed and stumbled to my window and took deep deep breaths and told myself everything was going to be okay and that I could handle this. I felt somewhat better after doing this and layed back down on my bed. My thoughts were racing. The most philosophical information about life was flowing through my brain and hovering over my head. I began to meditate to try to slow the thinking down and hold on to a thought and analyze it. Once I did this, I could literally see the thoughts floating above me and could pull one down and think about it or throw it out if it had a negative vibe about it. Absolutely amazing power that I believe meditating often, helped me achieve.
