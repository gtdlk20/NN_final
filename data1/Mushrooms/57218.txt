I already felt the effects but I wasn't on the onset yet, my thoughts were speeding up, I could already feel the time dilation, I started to hear a music playing in my head (there was no music playing by this point as my wife asked me to stop the music. In my head I could hear clearly the music Roar from Katy Perry, I don't like pop music, but this is what was playing. So I started to get a little bit anxious and kinda depressed. I tried to watch cartoons like I usually do while on LSD but it was unsucessful as I wasn't understanding what they were saying. So I tried to watch the vídeo clip from the music that I was hearing in my head. It was amazing to watch that vídeo. After this my wife called me to help them to grate some parmesian cheese, I wasn't in the mood to do anything by this point and the trip wasn't so fun. But as I know that by changing the set that you're on, the trip also takes a turn.
