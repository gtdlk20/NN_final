I found my broken ultrasonic humidifier at a pawn shop for $3.  Of course, the ultrasonic transducer (i.e. the little shinny thing at the bottom of the water chamber) was shot.  I called the company who manufactured the unit and they sent me another transducer.  I took the humidifier apart, soldering in the new transducer, and the thing worked fine.  You see these ultrasonic humidifiers 'don't' break; rather, 90% of the time some moron puts syrup in the chamber (which you can do in conventional humidifiers) and destroys the transducer.
