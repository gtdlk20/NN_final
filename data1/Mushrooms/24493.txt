We had the whole house and night to ourselves. There was a whole house full of people who were on nothing but LSD and/or Mushrooms. Every light was off, Every window was covered. Nothing but Candles flckering vibrantly and the distant screams of peoples souls breaking and minds expanding. Nothing but Pink Floyd played in the house that night.
