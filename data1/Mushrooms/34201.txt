I backed away from the wall to change positions and scenery. I looked at this poster of a girl in front of a waterfall and the water behind her was moving. My friend 'O' came up to me and muttered in my ear in a very 'old man' like voice and went 'lllllllook at those mmmmelon jugggs.' It was like I had just been told the most hilarious thing ever fathomed by a fellow human. My laughing fit was out of control, it was complete delusional hilarium. As soon as I started regaining control, my friend 'D' turned on the T.V. and this monkey was steering a truck with his teeth, and screaming and jumping and all this crazy shit. It was hysterical. The thought that someone out there actually had to film that seriously just made me laugh so hard, and I was partly laughing at how I must look to these guys.  It was a beautiful moment.
