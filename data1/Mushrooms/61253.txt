Before you know it I was being yelled at and grilled by my dad trying to make me throw up while the floor tiles were moving and the walls were breathing. I was absolutely terrified. After I threw up I started breaking down crying. My dad realized he may have been a bit too harsh with me. He put me on the couch and rubbed my legs while I got the rest of the fear out of my system. I told him about everything, my suicide attempt, my sexuality, and any other shit I had inside. He told me about how his mom used to do the same thing when he came home drunk late at night. After that, we sat on the couch eating popcorn and watching funny cartoons.
