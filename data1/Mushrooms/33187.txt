I called my brother D at about the 25 minutes point to give him some feedback. He encouraged me to go for 5g next time I think thats a bit rash when I was giving him feedback to the effect that it was a bad trip. Of course D is a hardened warrior of the chemical realm and so I judge that as macho talk. Anyway, he was good enough to have a caring chat and offered for me to call him back if I needed to.
