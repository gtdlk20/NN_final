I feel like that trip changed me. Ever since then, i've been less superficial and materialistic. I also understood the value of sobriety, and how taking a break can be a good thing. I got my shit together and had more success in my high school career than I ever thought I would have. I still smoke pot and have had a few more mushroom trips since then, along with DXM and LSA, but I have been far more careful with drugs since then.
