Anyways, things started to take an obvious turn for the worse momentarily.  This was about an hour to and hour and a half into the experience.  I began to notice these little red circle patterns that were on 'everything', including, my own skin.  For some reason this upset me, and I became somewhat frustrated.  I'm not sure, but it almost seemed that the particular color of red was what upsetting me.  Then the bad thoughts started to come.  I realized that I was alone and now wanted company.  I wanted to go drive around, but I convinced myself not too, understanding that it was too dangerous.  I kept thinking how awful my life was and how I didn't know what to do with myself.  Then I just wanted the shrooms to wear off.  This was about two hours into the trip.
