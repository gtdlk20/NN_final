It hit me fast and before I could even be concerned I launched into this DMT trip that was very strong and active. I was completely tripping in this DMT world/experience for three full hours. I can understand how anybody going through this would consider it a religious experience; however, there was no god, no angels or aliens or any entities. I was open to whatever this was but I have no idea what it is. I have been here before on DMT trips but briefly. This was a profound and unearthly experience I can only describe as some sort of telepathy with a higher consciousness and it was completely astonishing.
