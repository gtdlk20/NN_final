I keep typing because this will be so am(saved)azing to read later. But its tiresome to type, but the recordning is just part of this experience... other experiences will be different (ITs getting dark now) Do we always have this much going on in our hgeads... awareness of the windows my feet the time te [the?] my OWN awareness? I wish I could type better than I do so that others who read this will be able to see the thoughts which are, I'm afraid, rather crystal clear at this point.
