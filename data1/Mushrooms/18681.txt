I spent an extended time of looking at two photographs of myself and my wife, one from 11 years ago, and another from this year. This was extremely valuable.  It was like I was seeing myself like I was looking from the outside at me. Not an out of body experience, rather a perspective which was totally unique. I had a massive amount of compassion, empathy and love towards myself and my wife.  I could 'see' problems in our lives, ways in which we have been hurt in life, problems in our marriage, etc. I was able to see us both as little children, in need of love and patience and healing. If I ever do this kind of therapy again down the road I will be sure to have even more pictures of people handy.
