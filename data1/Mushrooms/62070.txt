10 min into it I started to feel it and something tells me in the back of my head 20 min later 'wow I'm tripping pretty hard'. I proceded to pick up a home made 'wand' and began to play with the surounding hallucinations (which were light at the time) then I started to see 3 images of the wand as I held it. I thought it was my contacts but as I rubbed my eyes I noticed this was the mushrooms. I looked at the wall where R's grow light was shining on next to his marijuaan plant (both filled the room with an intense comforting feeling) we proceded out to the living room and I look at the couch arm (about 45 min into the trip) and start to see this mayan like teal green drawing start to kalidescope around a black space were I saw a bearded man (jeasus?) and a tall mountain.
