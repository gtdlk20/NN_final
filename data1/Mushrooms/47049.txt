I watched the dancers and the way they moved their bodies fascinated the hell out of me! These dancers were obviously ones who have been doing this celebration for years because they had the vibe, and the way they connected their dance with the fire and the crowd perfected. They were experts, knew exactly what the observer wanted to see. All were volunteers. Even I danced later on in the night. Anyways, I was dancing, and tripping on the dancers and drummers, thinking, 'Wow, the drum beat assembly is like Barter Faire's heartbeat.'
