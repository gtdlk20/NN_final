I vacuumed my room, folded and put away my laundry, and cooked dinner all while tripping. I ate another mushroom after that. It was certainly not a good idea. My dad burst into my room, yelling at me about stealing his weed. He searched my room while I flushed the joints I was saving for after the drug test down the toilet in the next room. He apologized for the intrusion after he found nothing, and went to his room. A few seconds later, I hear him yell ******, GET OVER HERE RIGHT NOW! just as I was hitting the peak.
