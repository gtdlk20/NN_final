Note: during the time I took the ecstacy trip I was taking zoloft, but I didn't take it that same day, a couple days before, or a couple days after. When I took the mushroom trip I had been off zoloft for about two months. My psychiatrist said I should continue on zoloft, but said that my decision to stop taking it was okay. I'm still off the zoloft.
