For as long as I can remember, I have always searched for something more than this physical world. For example, I wanted to see a ghost, an alien, magic, God, etc. I was raised as a Catholic but as I became older, I began to doubt the existence of God or the values of the Catholic religion. I began to depressingly believe that once I die, I will just be in eternal blackness and unconsciousness, because from my experiences along with what I've learned about science, seemed like the only logical and possible result. Thats what Stephen Hawking believes, and I know hes a smart guy. I found myself living my life day to day just taking existence as it came.
