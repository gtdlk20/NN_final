After approximately 30 minutes, when I began to feel the body effects of the psilocybin, I laid on my bed on my back and concentrated on something I had read. Everyone knows that light casts a shadow. What most people don't consider is that sound casts a shadow too. Not in the sense of physics, but in the sense of psychology. I concentrated on the cars going by, then tried to listen to the shadow of the sound. I had read that this provides a doorway. A way to move into the subconscious or outside the body. A key to perhaps perform astral travel. Well, it worked for me. After 45 minutes another car went by. I had been concentrating on the 'shadow of the sound.' I had read that this was a doorway. I just didn't know where this door would lead. Then, I went through the door.
