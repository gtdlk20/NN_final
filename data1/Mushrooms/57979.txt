Afterwards I went for a bike ride and I saw the leaves as faces smiling and I couldn't to this very day describe how happy I was when I was on the shrooms. Everything is like a dream and everything is so happy and its just amazing... I don't take anything for granted, I looked up at the sky and it was so pretty I could sit there for years. I also remember crying to the music I was listening to, it was so beautiful. Basically shrooms is a positive experience and it is hard to have a bad trip. The only problem about them is I had a stomach ache but it was well worth it. I also remember laughing my head off when my friend came over and hearing the song breathe in my head by pink floyd... It was the most amazing day of my life
