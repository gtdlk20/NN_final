It was about time. I was so weak, I was barely able to move an arm or to keep my jaws closed. I layed in a hollow formed by a tree roots, made myself comfortable and tried to relax. It is a very nice place with view at the mountaintop with a few trees in the fore ground. But what I was seen was iridescent pattern web underlining every single spaces between intertwined branches. There, near the mountaintop, 4 prey birds were flying in circle leaving a shadow image behind them as in videoclip effect. At the same time, I was in awe listening to 'Joshua tree' by U2.
