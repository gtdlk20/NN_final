All day while we were in that hallway, I chained smoked cigarettes. The space of time in between my cigarette seemed to take forever, yet in reality they were only about five to ten minutes. I didn't go through a few packs of cigarettes, but I most definitely was smoking more rapidly than I usually do. And with every cigarette that I smoked, I would notice something new and cool about it.
