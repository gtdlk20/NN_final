In the taxi home, KT and I talked very abstractly about the night. I stopped after a while and with the aid of subtle hand signals asked her what she thought the taxi driver thought of the conversation. I got a very aggressive vibe off him but because I was more at ease having left the house, I wasnt in tune with it so it didnt affect me.
