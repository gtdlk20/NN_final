During this time while laying on the ground a large group of kids from my school shows up. I presume it is probably E's doing. She has been on her cell phone (I left mine in the car) and probably invited them to the park. They act in a manner that seems boorish to me. One blurts out, 'Dog let's just get drunk!' However, I am completely unfazed by this sophomoric attitude and accept it. Though, I do realize it as a completely worthless way to approach one's life. Also during this time another friend of E's shows up on his bike. Standing there, his tire, inflated to 90 psi, bursts. The boom is deafening and quite a shock to all of us high on mushrooms.
