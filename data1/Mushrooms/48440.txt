I can't remember much as I ended up falling asleep after some time because I really was not able to remember what I had done that day prior to taking the shrooms, nor who I was and I just wanted to sleep, although I was freaking myself out thinking maybe I am sleeping, in fact at one point I made myself believe I was lucid dreaming.
