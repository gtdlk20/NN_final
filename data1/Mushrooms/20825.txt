There is little else I can say about the dive because it was such a transient experience. It was the inner-scape of my mind. It reminds me of Buddha and his trials during his meditation. How he had to face fears to reach levels beyond. If I recall, he had to face Mara, an archetype of the ego.  What I can say is that it taught me about myself, my tenuous connection to this world, my spiritual readiness and how the prison bars of this reality are constructed out of fear.
