I had imagined myself being wheeled through the halls of a hospital with my parents panicking and crying beside the stretcher. This scared me to no end. In real life I was breathing very heavily and had cold sweats. I remember hearing my parents' voices (in my head at the hospital), my mother screaming and crying that I was dying, and my father's voice saying that I'm just tripping and that nobody has died from psilocybin. In hindsight I think they were a manifestation of my thoughts -- one thinking I died, the other one knowing I was fine.
