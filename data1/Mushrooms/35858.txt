For some reason it felt as if were laying totally flat even though we were at an angle. M was telling me how much he was enjoying the feeling. I agreed with him and told him tell me if he was scared or beginning to have a bad trip at all. We sat on the car and just talked about the beauty of this drug and why we did it. It was just fun to discuss topics we liked. We decided to go inside my car and listen to some music because it sounded so good. We put the AFI song Morningstar on repeat and analyzed how perfect that song was and how it related exactly to how we were feeling.
