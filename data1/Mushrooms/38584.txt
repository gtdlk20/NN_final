It was a sensory overload. I smelled a peculiar odor that I associated with the female reproductive system. I heard so many different noises; strange voices, computerized mechanical type sounds, a strange genre of music that sounded like a cross between bluegrass, jazz and Arabic melody and a noise that sounded like thousands of basket balls being bounced. Behind the apartment complex was a wooded area that looked very uninviting, and a small concrete lot over ran by weeds an enclosed by a shabby barbed wire fence. The cool breeze across my forehead which was gushing with sweat felt comforting.  My ears focused in on the errie demonic song of the nighttime insects. It was as if I could translate their language in to my own, but this frightened me because I have a phobia of insects. So I tuned them out and focus my ears on the strange music I could hear in the distance. A single tree standing steadfast and proud in front of the woods caught my tripping eyes. It was a mighty oak, and it had the face of an old man on its front surface, which smiled at me.  You shouldnt smoke, son. Its bad for ye lungs, the tree said to me with an Irish accent.  Your, your, your, alive! But, but, I quit eating meat because the animals are alive! And I eat plants, please dont be angry at me sir, I stuttered in disbelief.
