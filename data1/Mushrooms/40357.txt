I went to the toilet which was possibly the most confusing part of the trip, the floral patterns and the small size of the room got to me, everything swam moved and shifted and I was completely at peace. Size distortion is a wonderful thing. As it got darker, (this is outside, mind you) I discovered the fun of staring at a light and seeing what interesting things came out of the blobs that you get when you look at a bright light.I Watched an electric helicopter float by, and a neon fly past, and a few indiscernable objects defy the laws of physics. Once back inside, I realised that ramon's claims that he needed a clothes line in his room was not empty speculation. A long pole extended vertically across his room and a pair of pants hung happily over the middle. Ramon stood idly chewing on his paint brush saying 'Yeah man...Yeah...Some weird shit's goin' down.'  Then we sat down and watched 'Diamonds are forever' and 'fantasia' and realised that james bond is a cunt, and that walt disney had also done mushrooms. The next hour we pretty much came down and exhaled deeply. Although I think ramon was still buzzing long after I sobered up. It was an interesting trip, I definetley tapped into a higher consciousness I'd never known before. We discussed some deep shit. I think that mushrooms are something that I could do once a year and be completely happy with my life.
