But before I tell you that I must tell you about A, K, L, R and B. Those were the 5 friends I tripped with. A, K and L are my best friends and I love them very much. R is an old friend I am fond of whereas B is a person I like but am not close to. L was going through a phase of indecision about a personal matter at the time: she was contemplating whether to break things off with her fianc√©.
