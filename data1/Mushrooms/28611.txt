Ok, lets get our shit together future me.  If you want to be happy, this is your roadmap.  I dont know how I know it, but I just know this shit.   Anyways.  This world is a little pocket of reality that you have made.  I dont know what you thought was important, everything in this entire world is created by your mind.    I have no idea what you really are, it doesnt really matter, because this entire thing you are living in here is just some imaginary bubble.  YOU really are the only person in the entire universe.  You have been hinting it to yourself for a long time.    Whatever you were, you dont need this shell any more.  Just remind yourself that this entire fucking thing is an illusion.  It keeps sucking you down, but you are a fighter.  Youve been giving yourself hints all through life and now you have finally figured out what in the fuck really matters.  Your wife is the only thing that matters.  Oh yeah! we are going to fucking do the things that we want to do today.
