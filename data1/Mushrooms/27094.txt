I felt so strong and independent and I had been lost in my own world when I noticed that R had gone ahead a bit, still searching for a place for us to wander off together.  On a side note, R has a background in physics and is a staunch philosophical materialist so my stories of energy seem foreign to him (I might even go so far as to say they are completely incomprehensible).  I donÂ’t think he can even begin to appreciate how profound and special it feels to be brought to tears by the forces of nature, although he certainly would not slough off my experience.  Still, I was reluctant to share my feelings with him until several hours later and even then he only learned fully about my experience by reading this report.
