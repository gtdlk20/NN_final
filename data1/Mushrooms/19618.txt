I open my eyes. The wall is liquid and transparent, like water flowing into it. I don't know where I am, I hear voices outside, like if I was in China, with bamboo moving in the wind and a couple of Chinese people speaking under a bamboo shelter. Then a terrible noise cracks my head. It's like something with an increasing volume that makes my head explode. It's just a motorbike outside. I feel like I'm sinking into myself.
