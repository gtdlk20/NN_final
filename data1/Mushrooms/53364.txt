I mustn't erase. But that's just a weird 'going home' craving. I've THGOUHT these things, but I can get them on paper(ish) now. This is pretty amazing. And there is NO FEAR that what I took is something besides what I think it is.... CUZ I grew it! I made it! My work my time my effort... this need to share is ammzing... the cat ... where is she...
