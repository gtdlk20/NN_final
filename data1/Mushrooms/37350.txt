Shrooms can have different personalities.  Some are aggressive and rough, like high school football coaches.  Some are like therapists, and some are like good friends.  These shrooms turned out to be very happy and friendly therapists, glad to help me work through my problems.  I am indebted to the little guys; that was a great day in my life.
