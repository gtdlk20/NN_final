8:45pm - It was about one hour after we all initially dosed.  I was feeling the most delicious stone of my life.  Everything was starting to get really funny and I was feeling rather heavy.  The christmas lights on the walls weren't changing or haloing like I had read.  I just felt like everything was terribly funny and even my laugh was feeling funny.  We were all having trouble articulating our thoughts and a guy nobody knew came in and tried talking to us and no one wanted him in the room while we were shrooming.  He tried to make conversation but all we could do was start to say something and then crack up for several minutes.  This continued for about 5 minutes of the group of us just laughing our heads off until the guy left.
