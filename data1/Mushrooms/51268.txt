I did not eat much that day and also was taking St. Johns Wort because I had read it had MAOI properties and would double the potency of the shrooms. I took a few earlier in the day and about 10 right before I ate the shrooms. I do not know how potent the MAOI properties of St. Johns Wort are but this did it for me.
