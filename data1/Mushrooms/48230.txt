The best part, matching the intensity and enjoyment of the visuals, was the body high. When I was in a good situation, whenever I was with K alone, or K and T: not really having to make conversation that tasked my mind in other words, I would feel a body high that not only surpassed X, but gave me a truly joyous, good feeling. It surpassed X because I was not only seeing heavy visuals, but my sensory input was starting to get distorted, my fingers and body in general were all out of wack, but in a wonderful way.
