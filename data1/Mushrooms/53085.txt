I was immediately removed from reality and thrown into my own little, lonely world. I was rolling, I mean i was totally rolling, over and over again. I was confusing myself and sort of flipping out. I was trapped in fear in a world that i thought I could not get out of, but desperately wanted to. I remember thinking, what I would give to have things normal again. I was freaking out. I started jabbering on, and really felt that I was annoying the others in the room. I wanted to stop and just chill, but couldn't. I hudled up in a corner of a couch and just kept talking to myself, convinced that I was going through a bad trip. It was way to intense for me to even look around the room and try and see visuals.
