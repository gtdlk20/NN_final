On halloween I was planning to get acid because I thought it would be cool from what I've read about it. But I was unable to obtain it, so instead I got mushrooms. I have only previously in my life done pot, ecstacy, coke and speed. These drugs were horibly boring and a waste to me (except ecstacy, that was cool).
