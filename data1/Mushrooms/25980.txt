From about half an hour onwards I noticed that my visual perception had changed quite a bit, with colours looking brighter, and the beginning of the pseudo slow-motion vision that occurs when I trip.  Everything looked slightly different, and although it is hard to say why, I think that everything begins to look larger than life. I later realised why bubbles in water look so strange and beautiful. The bubbles made from splashing water are all normally slightly irregular, and when sober you can perceive this. However I realised that whilst tripping these irregular bubbles looked perfectly circular to me, and this feature combined with their crystal-like reflection of light made them once again one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. Everything else I looked at whilst tripping had a subtly smoothed and unnaturally regular shape and outline, so that everything looked almost fake, and combined with the brighter colours that everything possessed objects seemed to be almost cartoonish to me.
