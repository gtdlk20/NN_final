Once they started to wear off somewhat, the trip became even more enjoyable. The sheer confusion and delirium of the earlier stages started to subside, to be replaced by a pure, comprehensive understanding of everything. Thats how it seemed anyway.

I felt as If I could see in into the future  not literally, but that I could make an accurate prediction of future events based on the knowledge of previous ones. My reality seemed to be the epitome of a perfection that I had created, if you get what I mean! Its difficult to explain. I embraced a lust for life I had never previously experienced and carry with me to this day. As we shared this collective experience between us, I had never ever felt so alive. It was breathtaking. I felt like a god.
