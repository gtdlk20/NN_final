I awoke to the sound of the tv playing some early morning mma show. I looked at the digital clock... 4:15am. I still didnt feel right, I still didnt know who I was. The fighters on the mma show looked like WWE figurines made of plastic, I didnt recognize any of them. I reached across the bed and saw my phone. Shit, did I ring anyone when I was tripping? Has it been hours or days?! I didnt even know my name, I looked at the phone screen and just sat there gazing at this picture of a father and son. The longer I stared the more I realized the picture was of myself and my son. I felt like crying, I survived! Like being reborn all these memories of who I was and where I lived came flooding back into my mind. It was like I was getting rebooted or restarted like a computer. I then slowly started to drift back off to sleep.
