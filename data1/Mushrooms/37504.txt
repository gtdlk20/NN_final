The next day was a great day. I rented a movie, smoked a few bowls, listened to music. My mind felt refreshed. Driving my car was very enjoyable, the breeze from the open windows was great. The music sounded subtly sweeter, and the trees looked subtly better. Dialoguing with people was a more engaging and pleasant experience, especially with people I didn't know. A few days after the trip I decided to sit down and meditate, not knowing the great news my newly refreshed mind was about to give me. Meditation was simple, unlike it had been for the past year since that ecstacy trip. I drifted off every now and then as was usual, but I found it dramatically easier to come back to my object of focus. Every decision to listen to my breath resulted in a smooth and quieting moment where I shifted back and remained there as long as I kept my concentration. I've been meditating a lot since that day (which was less than a month ago), and i've improved a little. I don't get distracted as much, and my stretches of concentration are becoming longer. After I finish my meditation session, my mind is significantly quieter and more focused.
