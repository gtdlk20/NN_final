We got to the parking lot of where we were going to hike, and decided to first sit by the ocean and smoke some weed. Smoking weed on mushrooms makes me start tripping all over again, so by the time we finished, I was hallucinating really hard. We climbed into a really long culvert and were fascinated by the circle of daylight we could see outside, it was amazing. After that, our trip-sitter said he was going to take us to see the oracle. I immediately thought of the woman in the matrix, but realized it wouldn't be the same thing. So we started to hike up over the highway through the lush forest. We got to a clear spot in the trees and I could stand on the edge of the rock and see the ocean and the moutains and the forest, it was really amazing. I remeber standing there with my arms wide feeling like I was god with all the energy flowing through me.
