10:50- after wandering for a good while I could feel the effects coming down pretty solid. I still saw the people trying to grab me and pull me down, still ignoring it as I knew it was not real, they did not frighten me, nothing did. We walked into complete darkness into the trees, and had a smoke, then went home. Sleep was good, extremely good.
