This experience has furthered my belief that the human mind is a powerful thing. Ive seen and experienced this phenomenon occur with other substances as well (Hydrangea leaves, garden variety salvia, etc). If I think Im gonna get high from smoking mushrooms, my mind doesnt want to disappoint, so my perception is altered.  As I engage myself in a different train of thought my senses are returned to normal.
