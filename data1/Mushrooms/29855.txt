I took a shower and set up my computer so I could listen to music while I trip. It was about an hour now since I first started eating them and I was lying in bed in the dark waiting for it to kick-in. I dont think I was through one song before I launched into a very strong DMT like trip. I turned off the music. This was something special happening and I did not want music or anything to interfere with what was happening. There is an audio aspect to this but I cant really describe it. It affects the ears like a distant churning of some sort.
