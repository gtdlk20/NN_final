As we arrived some cigarettes were had and we noticed a few paths leading down the hill and into a dense forest. Do some exploring, and what we found! A ways down the path the forest opened into a huge canopy with rocks and tress and hills and green and fun at every turn. We started to trip. It was a playful running and laughing thing. we ventured back to the top to watch the sun set over the skyline, I was the first up and I noticed that the normally white tower was now a vibrant but suttle pink. my mind still somewhat intact at the time wondered if it was a reflection of the sky but that was a burning orange. I stared for a few moments before realizing a family of picnicers staring at me, I joined my journymen around the corner on a bench. for a time we sat and spoke loudly about how we liked it better in the forest and how the rigid stucture of society was crushing us and everyone else. The seeds of escapism took root.
