I had to get up several times to urinate, as is usual when taking mushrooms. It was a tremendous effort, as I was very unsteady on my feet, totally uncoordinated. As I came back to bed each time, and I closed my eyes, I saw many images. All seemed to be fired off by (or coinciding with) a mental sound or word, or should I say a vocalization. It was someone saying these pseudowords. Nonsense words, meaning nothing in our everyday language. Childish enunciations that I have experienced almost since the first time I ate psilocybin mushrooms. But I wonder if maybe they might have some meaning nonetheless. Terence McKenna was big on language during the psilocybin trance. I say someone was vocalizing, but I wasn't the one. Who?
