Lisa and me felt as if he were compelled to go marvel at the lights and colors of the food court...so we did. We probably walked around it like 5 times pointing out every new thing we saw. I remember I had a funny taste in my mouth so I got a drink, but I was so far from being hungry you have no idea. I would not even begin to try and think about food. I donÂ’t think I could have sat still for the time long enough to eat. J
