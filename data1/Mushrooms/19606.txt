My girlfriend found a worm on her hand (a real one, I can tell because I saw them before). I don't care about it, I want to get back to my vision, I say I don't want her to interfere. I stand up and start moving. It's hard to manage but not impossible. It's like I am a puppet moving with wires. I start spinning around, all the trees become a vortex, too strong for me. I sit on my own again, brace position. I disappear in a world of colourful visions. Fluorescent lines move leaving traces on a black screen, following a secret geometry. Then she call me again, she tells me it's raining. I didn't realise it. We decide to go back to the hotel, I think it should not be difficult. I start running, following a path, but then I realise it is wrong. We change the way and suddenly I have a powerful sensation. I am among brilliant green heart shaped leaves, the rain is like ice needles against my face, the wind is blowing as in dolby surroundÂ… wow, it is the first time I really understood what 'tripping' means: I entered an altered reality.
