We spent the next at least 4 hours sitting under a tree in the quiet section of the event.  You can think of it like the chill room at a club; We weren't completely removed from the envigorating energy of the drunken masses, and yet thankfully apart from it.  It was here that I experienced probably the most blissful period of my life thusfar.  Sitting on that hill under the tree, I felt like Buddha upon reaching enlightenment.  It may have even been heightened by the fact that I had undergone such a tortuous experience not an hour earlier.  We simply sat under that tree and watched the various drunk people stumble their way past us, which was especially fun because we were on a steep embankment which is difficult to maneuver sober, let alone more drunk than you have ever been before.
