This was definitely a life changing experience but I find it takes a long time to really incorporate it into my daily persona.  Its like everything has changed and nothing has changed.  Im reminded of that part in Aladdin where the Genie describes what its like to be a Genie: Phenomenal cosmic power!!!! iiiiddy biiiddy living space.
