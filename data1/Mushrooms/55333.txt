We started off the night with a mile or so walk to another friend's house, who ended up not being home. We smoked a bowl of weed, while waiting for our third party member to return, which fucked us up quite a bit, being that neither of us had smoked in at least a year. After deciding that she wasn't going to arrive, we walked back to my friend's house, sat around for a little bit, and when we started coming off the weed, it was suggested... 'you want to do those shrooms tonight?'
