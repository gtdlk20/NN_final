My 1st encounter with psychedelia was not drug induced, it was lucid dream (i classify it in psychedelism because of its non-normal environnement). But, i did not knew how to define psychedelia until i took shrooms. I've done other drugs before, like weed, ether, alcool, xtc (MDMA isn't a psychedelic for me). I've done mushrooms a few times before this, but never feel any effects (as my other friends was feeling them).
