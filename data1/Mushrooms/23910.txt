T+03:30ish - It turned out we were never lost--we lived in a very small mountain town in which the creek is always parallel to the main road, and we were following the creek.  We found the road and made our way down toward W's house, which was empty of people.  We could trip there in safety.  I was incredibly dizzy, couldn't walk straight or see straight at all.  All we had to guide us was starlight, but that was enough to light the way very well for our dilated eyes.  On the way down the road we continued to talk loudly and randomly shout out 'Reality,' or 'Hey Ralph!'  We concluded that we had left Ralph at the waterfalls, as none of us felt much nausea after my shit fit and we hadn't talked about the nausea for a while.  Poor Ralph was all alone at the falls and we'd never see him again.  It all seemed so hilarious.
