Therefore, 30g fresh cubensis equals 3g dried, which is almost an eighth. (So to get the equivalent of 3g dried experience with fresh mushies Â– 30g, one need eat only 15g fresh sclerotia as the fresh are twice as potent. To get the equivalent of 3g dried mush, 4g dried sclerotia would be needed, as dried sclerotia are 2/3 weaker than dried mush.) IF MY MATH IS CORRECT!  5g fresh sclerotia should = 1g dried cubensis. I am horrible at math, but even I had the patience to puzzle this one out (laugh as you like).
