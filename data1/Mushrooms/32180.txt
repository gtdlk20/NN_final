As my thoughts traveled, I could start to feel the energy of the horses that had traveled on this path before me. I could see through their eyes and experience their thoughts. I went between many different horses until my mind stopped on the Kentucky Derby winner, Ill Have Another. This was the day that he had to be scratched from the Belmont Stakes due to an injury, losing his chance at the Triple Crown. I felt the sadness and disappointment he was experiencing. I could see him in the stable, sulking. I talked to him, telling him it wasnt his fault, that he was such an inspiration and a fantastic horse! I kept him in my thoughts for the duration of the evening.
