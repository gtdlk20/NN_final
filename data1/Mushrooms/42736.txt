The trip was coming in waves, I would be tripping face for 20 mins then comedown to a less confused mind for 10 mins then start tripping hard again. I decided to eat a bowl of cereal and a glass of milk to help me come down. As I was drinking the milk I couldn't tell if I finished the milk or not so I just put it in the sink but I think did drink it all. The bowl of cereal was moving a lot, the edges of the bowl were warping around. My face was numb and my hands were clammy. Pupils huge. I was not having a good time but it was not a hell trip. I would hear a sound and it would echo around the room witch was just amazing. I was hearing a lot of sounds. I stared at a pen on my desk it and seemed to be really far away, this was not comforting because I was trying to comedown. I would keep feeling my face because it just felt so weird. I touched my noise but I couldn't tell witch nostril I was touching. I was really confused but still able to tell what was generally going on, I was in my house tripping and I was safe. I decided to take some cold meds to make me go to sleep because I was so tired, I just took a normal dose of something with DXM in it.
