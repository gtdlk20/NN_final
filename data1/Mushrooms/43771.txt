I looked at jays face and he grew a huge beard, I watched his beard go from completely shaved to a big osama beard. This freeked me out and I started to yell. He told me to 'shut the fuck up'. This set off a very bad vibe. I ran outside, scared as fuck, looked up at the sky and the clouds shaped into a giant asian man, who praid to me, then winked,then he disapeard. One would think this would be a plesent visual but in the mind set jay put me in, I thought they asian man meant harm. At 2:00 I darted out of his and he screamed for me, but I kept running, I felt like I was running for hours, I finally reached my house. (I live on the same block as jay, time just didnt make sense.)I ran inside, fell on the ground and started crying. I closed my eyes and saw a clown face. Needles spurted out of the clowns face and the blood oozed out of his mouth, I started crying more, lying on the ground in the fetal position. The clown imaged left and all I saw was geometrical paterns, I forgot I was every sober, I thought this was life. I beleive that I was a metaphor, only a thought. I never existed. Life never existed. I was part of the pattern that was playing over and over in my head. This scared me, but at this time being scared was not possible, nothing exist, I was gone the world did not connect to me. I became a vegitable for the next two hours.
