I tried to extend my range of perception and found no added abilities and became quickly distracted by other thoughts.  I started to pay attention to strange visual effects and chose not to do so.  I tried to focus on healing, by focusing on a friends dilemma and felt strongly the sadness of muddling through problems that have no clear resolution.  I feel sadness and joy for the difficulty of things in life.  I felt like I was able to connect more easily to feelings than I am normally.
