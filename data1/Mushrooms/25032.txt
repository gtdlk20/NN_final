Seconds later I bursted into uncontrollable tears not comprehending what had just happened.  I grabbed the phone in a panic and called the first person to come to mind to come and save me from myself(not realising I had already done so).  That friend would come to my place promptly to give me the help that I thought that I needed. Turned out that I did not need that.  Knowing that someone was on the way helped put me at ease.  I knew that my friend would not be there for about a half hour as he was coming from downtown. So I sat and reflected on what had just happened.
