I got lots of synethesia in the car. Id smell smoke, and feel one way. Id scratch my hair and smell the color green. I touched the leather seat and felt slow and leathery. The two girls we were with were scary melting skeletons more or less. The ride felt like zoo ride as we watched people on the streets go about their ways. At one point I felt like lying down and melting my body into G, Instead I fell over on him as we went around a turn and bashed him in the head. He spent the rest of the day trying to figure out if he got a bloody nose. I think I fell asleep in the car after a while. When we got out back at the school and got out it was like a whole other world outside the car.
