As I said, I had done mushrooms before, and that was a glowing experience. I felt connected with all beings around me and their struggle for survival. I remember being very fascinated with birds and how they navigated the landscape that we humans define, completely oblivious of our existence as anything more than a mysterious obstacle in their constant struggle to find food. The warmth of the earth, the sun and the grass was like a gentle reassurance that there is good in this world. I was with a friend and a friend of his. I am generally a very reserved person so awkwardness and hidden fears surfaced in me but only briefly and overall I would say this was a bonding experience with both of them, and after it I felt a certain sense of camaraderie having been through something like that with others.
