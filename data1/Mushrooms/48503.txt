I then stumbles into my bed, pulled up the covers, and listened the Johnny Cash song Highwayman on repeat. What a trippy piece. The themes of life after death and never ending existence blew my mind. Cashs deep voice and lyrics were perfect for the setting. I drifted off to sleep as I looked up at the stars above me. I thought that there was no roof above my head and that I was out in the wilderness. Amazing.
