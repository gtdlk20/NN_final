I noticed how vibrant and green the whole landscape seemed to be, and couldn't help but comment on it.  My friend K, a gorgeous young lady, seemed insect-like and insane to me, most likely because she was as pumped up as I was, and couldn't stop smiling.  We continued up the trail, all of us commenting on how the trees and bushes seemed to reach out and try to grab us.  In this part of the mountains, its very dry and dead, the predominant colors being grey and brown.
