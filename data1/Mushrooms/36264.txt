I was feeling quite strange and I told W and J that I wanted to walk home.  W told me 'I don't think that's such a good idea' and laughed at me.  I agreed with him and was glad when he stood up to leave.  We walked back out to J's car and got in.  The wind at the top of the hill was cold but I still opened the window when I got in.  On the ride home we overlooked a large shopping center with a lot of lights.  W said 'how ill does that look dude?' and I just nodded back to him.  He laughed.  I was glad that W understood because he had tripped off of the same shrooms only 3 days ago.  He told me that during his peak he was thinking 'please god let it be over' so I laughed in my head.  I also found it quite funny that W and J were completely normal and I was tripping balls in the back seat of his car.
