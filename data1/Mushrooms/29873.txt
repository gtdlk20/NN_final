Anyway, I have no clue as to what it is or what is going on. This was an incredible experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed. When I first started to come down after a good three hours in a very strong DMT like trip I felt a peaceful calm and now Im tired. Having experimented with LSD in my younger days I have to say this is completely unlike the LSD trip. This was many times more visual than any straight LSD experience Ive ever had.
