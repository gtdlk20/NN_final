12:25 PM - Feel an odd, mild sensation of warmth in my chest and part of my face, also feel a little more sociable in a funny way, not in a stimulant way. Can't put it down to anything else.. Maybe a placebo as it's only been 5 minutes, but it's certainly interesting me.. There's something not so placebo about it.
