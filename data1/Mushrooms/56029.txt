We arrived to the national park and camped in a cottage which was free to use. It had wood stove and plenty of firewood, though we had to split the wood by ourselves from the logs. Left our backbags in  the cottage and hiked to near by hillcliff to smoke some herbs. Up in the hill the view opens large areas of swamp and forrest. The memories from the trip before came to my mind where we danced the hillside up and down in total darkness to drink more mushroom tea and back up to watch the stars. Also remembered our tactic to fight off the bears if we would ever meet one in the darkness, stick together, look big and have your knife ready....and other things that had happened.
