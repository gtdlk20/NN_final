As we all came down, we all felt a feeling of peacefulness, and love, remembering things like how nice it was to be little and to cuddle in our mothers arms. As we came down, we decided to smoke some MJ to ease back down and then hit up the local gas station for some beverages. But as we leave I have a feeling that I need to sit down, I immediately stop and sit at my kitchen table. I look at my boyfriend and said, I think somethings wrong' but nothing came out of my mouth. The next thing I see is both of their faces in a slight terror and I ask, What happened?' As I regained myself, I heard my boyfriend say, honey you had a seizure.
