And then I began to speak.  I told all of them that the world was a wonderful place, and whatever they wanted to do to express themselves was fine with me.  I told Kevin if being anxious and agressive was his thing, that I was cool with it, and that he should 'groove to it.'  He caught my vibe and instantly his face found happiness and I knew that he was one with me spiritually.  Jake, however, had already gotten there with me.  I had caught his eye after he had bowled his last set.  Our expressions were motionless, but we both knew that we were there.  Tom was there too, a little bit differently from us though.  Because he wasn't a regular, he didn't catch quite the right vibe, but it was a good one.
