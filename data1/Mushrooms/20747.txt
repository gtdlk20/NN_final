I ended up back with my wife again and she had become obsessed with the time and how slow it was going. She kept asking Jen what time it was and Jen always seemed to reply with the same time. It seemed like it took an hour for a minute to go by. I did realize that she was improving and I was then overcome by the sensation of swimming through these shaped blue geometric objects the approximate size of dominos but of unexplainable geometric complexity and a morphing of Z shaped white and light blue patterns moving across each of the shapes facades.  They were perfectly smooth and I swam through and on them. They were beautiful and felt wonderful on my skin. They dripped off my fingers as if they were water. I swam from my wife over to Jen who was lying on the sofa. She looked at me and asked (laughing) What the Fuck did you do? I asked her how she was doing and she said OK, Im keeping an eye on Annie. I said wouldnt it be nice to go swimming in the hot tub. I had enjoyed swimming so much on the geometric objects I thought water would be really nice. She fortunately said no that would be a bad idea. I was agreeable and stayed inside.
