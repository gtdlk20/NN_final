After the fact I realized my attitude towards a particularly important issue was changed, even though I have no recollection of thinking upon the issue during therapy. I had for a long time felt insecure about my life success, as judged by the world's standards.  I have a number of high school friends who have gone on to be very successful in their careers and business, and have compared them to myself, who earns a very modest living working with people with autism. Amazingly after therapy, this insecurity was no longer present. I now know that my life is not so bad, and I am not ashamed of not making much money compared to others or being as 'successful'.
