After the aliens, mind-blowing artistic images appeared. I've been reading Alex Grey's 'The Mission of Art', and finally saw the grid-like nets of light that had inspired him and his wife during an acid trip. There were 3-D leathery black serpents woven like vines, colourful pen and ink etchings, and fantasy creatures reminiscent of Patrick Woodroffe's illustrations. Whenever I turned to look at M, I saw into his flesh, as if it was translucent and swimming with layers of underwater life. I began to nibble on his hands, and experiment with the feel and taste and strangeness. I made up words and laughed and laughed with my funny new language. I may have freaked him out a bit!
