At some point (maybe around +3 hours in) we just started to laugh uncontrollably. Everything was just indescribably funny, I was feeling euphoric and overjoyed, everything was well in the Universe, pure love, joy and laughter. I had an insight, that everything is always alright  all this pain, sorrow, bad things we experience, they are just an illusion. At the bottom of it all, everything is always allright. It was a very comforting feeling. After the laughter episode we started to come down bit by bit. We were sitting in each others laps, looking into each others eyes, and I felt a very deep connection with A, like I had known him for all my life and my previous ones, even though in (normal/physical/3D) reality I had only met him a few days prior. Looking into his eyes his face morphed into different faces, it was like I was seeing some of his past lives in his face, and he in mine. I had a feeling that the trip would never end in a way, even though I knew it would, and at the same time I was feeling sad that we had to come back  I could foretell that the connection I was feeling with him right now, the soul connection, would be lost in the normal world, and even though I would always remember it, I didnt know whether he would.
