By the time we were done smoking I was definitely tripping. I got some really cool open eye visuals. I got the common breathing visual. It appeared that everything had a life force and that everything was breathing.I felt really connected to my surroundings. After smoking and going inside I decided I wanted to be alone to explore my state of mind. I went back to my room dont really know how I got there but I got there. I put on some music and put on the visualizer on my lab top. It is a program that throws up awesome visuals along to the music it is very trippy even without tripping already. I got lost in the moving shapes I must have stared at it for 30 minutes. I was fascinated by it, it was pulling me in this life force was pulling me into it I was inside this new dimension. I could swim through it and float as if I was flying.
