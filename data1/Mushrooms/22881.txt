I entered Granada Park through the corner entrance that snaked in between the trees. In the wan light provided by the streetlights, everything took on an otherworldly glow and I briefly entertained the thought of how wonderfully terrifying it would be to be lost in the trees when the mushrooms took effect. I was still sober at this point although I was becoming obsessively focused on making sure my headphones were correctly arranged inside of my scarf. I carried on and laid down on a picnic table to stare up at the stars and then the nausea hit me. I remember having to take the book of poetry out from underneath my jacket because the weight of it was exacerbating my upset stomach. This was when I noticed my first visuals. Every breath I was taking, the starry night sky above me was repeating. It would expand and contract in rhythm with my diaphragm.
