Some good mushroom inspired lyrics eh? Anyway I jammed that song out for like 20 minutes (even though it can be cut down to 3-4 minutes, but why do something like that??) and had a lot of fun listening to the dank sound of my own guitar. Playing with my Boomerang Phrase Sampler is always a blast, it's just about the best thing I ever bought, and it was even more fun on shrooms.
