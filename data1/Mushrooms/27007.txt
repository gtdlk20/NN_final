Earlier on in the day before I took the mushrooms, I talked to my ex-girlfriend on the telephone. She said that she might come over later to visit but maybe not. I still had a great deal of feelings about us breaking up and I also had a tiny bit of anxiety about the slight possibility of having to deal with people while I was high on mushrooms, so I really didnt want her to come over but I also wanted to be nice so I said okay, cause in all honesty this didnt seem like that big of a deal at the time, and I went ahead as planned.
