I did not experience anything unusual within the first hour or so, possibly even two hours. What I did notice (upon analyzing the events later on) was a slowly rising giddyness and an inability to hold a train of thought for very long. During the course of the walk from where my friend and I took them to my apartment I would forget a line of thought then it would bubble up maybe five, ten minutes later. The giddyness felt something like being drunk, only with hyper overtones.
