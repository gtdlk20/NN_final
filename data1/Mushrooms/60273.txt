Like I said, initially it took me by surprise how fast it hit me, how strong the effects were and the unfamiliarity of my new mindset.  But, after about 5 min's, I was ok with everything.  But, I must say, I am a headstrong person and live for danger and new experiences.  Driving on shrooms??? Hmmm. . .for me, it was awesome.  Was I in as much control as I felt I was in? Trip, tripping like I was, was no gauge for my driving tactics - but the Trooper on side of us for about 3 miles was - seemed to be fine, but I haven't done it since.
