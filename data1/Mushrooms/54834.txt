It all started in school my sophomore year during exams, after I had finished my chemistry exam. I had a half oz of mushrooms in my pocket and realized that I had no classes left in the day and still 1:30 minutes till my exam period was finished. I headed for the bathroom and chomped down an eighth with some water from the sink as a chaser.
