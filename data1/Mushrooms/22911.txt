But the thoughts of her came regardless of what Michael sang about. I wondered if I ever really loved her. After all, I never really pressed the issue. I never made any eternal  declarations of love and now certainly wasn't the time for them considering she's in a relationship. I wondered if all the things I did, from the stream of gifts to the trips to the almost servile behaviour I displayed around her, was to prove to myself that I really was in love with her. Because that question almost never really had an answer for me. What is love after all? I know what lust is because it's a direct emotion I can feel. I don't know what love is because no one's ever told me that they're in love with me. And I'm not sure if unreciprocated love is the real thing. But there are those moments. Those moments when I've stared at her sleeping next to me - I've always been too afraid to look while she's awake - that I get overwhelmed in this emotion that I don't know the name for. It's like I want to just stay by her side and protect her from everything - from banalites like sunburn, from the men that'll break her heart, from the drugs she escapes into, from the cruelty that she focuses on, from everything and anything. I want to just be there and keep her safe and stare into her face as I fall asleep with her by my side. Those moments bring me an almost otherworldly sense of calm and joy. Maybe that's what love is, but I sure as hell don't know
