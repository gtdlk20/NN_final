Then I did the dumbest, careless thing I could think of that would send my trip into the dark abyss but only for a short while. You see, the fire was started with axe deoderant spray, so I carelessly threw it into the fire knowing that it was empty. About ten minutes later my friends and I were talking about what it will be like when we cross over to the other side, when all of a sudden BOOM. It sounded, and felt as if a spud gun had shot a medicine ball into our chests. We sat there in awe thinking to ourselves 'Did we just die?' Colors intertwined in my eyesite even stronger than before, and a ringing like you do nitrous oxide prevailed as i tried to figure out what the hell just happened. My thoughts, neutral, as I pulled myself together and realized the dumb mistake I had initiated. Damn was I an idiot I thought, as I looked over at my friend in tears. Poor kid..it sent him on an insanity spree thinking he had crossed over for a good hour. The moral of the story: -Dont' be a dumbass like me and throw axe deoderant spray cans into the outdoor fireplace.
