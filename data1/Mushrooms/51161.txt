Then i got home. I was still tripping slightly, but i felt ok finally. I came into my room and found that a bunch of stuff, including my bong, a bottle full of water (with no cap), and a couple model cars were knocked on the floor and spilled everywhere. i realized that my dad had come in at some point during the night, and did this, completely breaking all trust i had in him and in people. I had been very open with my father, and he was actually in approval of my drug experimentation because of my attitude toward them, and my desire to learn and not just party (which i think also lends to my guilt for enjoying the mushrooms...since i want to learn so much, and look down so much on simply taking drugs for fun, i wouldnt let myself have fun....but thats another story).... So, when i saw that he had done this, i felt as though it was the final straw, my backbone of trust in people was immediately destroyed.
