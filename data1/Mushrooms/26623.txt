I had been growing mushrooms on a fairly large scale.  I had 3 large terrariums with about 56 cakes (PFs, Hawaiians, Ecuadorians, and Stropharias) that were flushing quite regularly.  I was yielding quite a bit per week.  I come from a family of live let live 60s generation hippie parents (great people) who didnt necessarily discourage my drug use, but wanted me to wait until a later age, until I got involved.  So you can imagine when my mother found my high-tech humidified, timed, and ever so expensive and hand crafted terrariums buzzing away happily in my closet she become slightly perturbed, especially when the legal responsibility would have been on her back.  I was 16 at the time.  The result of that incident was a big blowout, ending in my temporary suspension from the house, immediate death of all my wonderful mushrooms/equipment (the equipment was dismantled and boxed up), and the promise that I could do whatever I wanted once I was 18, but that wasnt good enough for me, so I stubbornly refused to abide by her rules (no drugs) and went to live with my sister for about a month.
