I drove up from Miami to Ft. Myers on that Friday at noon to meet my girlfriend and have the shroom trip. It turned out to be at first a little bit of a cloudy afternoon, but we went and found a nice grassy spot under a tree by the lake on the Everglades campus anyways. Having been warned to eat less than 1/8 an ounce of these particular shrooms, we each started with half-eighth of finely chopped shrooms in a tuna sandwich and a chicken salad wrap. Camille didnt really enjoy the tuna sandwich, saying it didnt really mask the taste or texture very well, but I personally recommend a chicken salad sandwich like the wrap I had made, as the mushrooms were barely noticeable and it was delicious.
