I checked twice more if the doors were locked then I vaguely remember turning on the T.V. because a part of my now scattered mind wanted to see what was on. Then I heard a furious pounding on my back door and the feeling of paranoia increased 10 fold. I walked to my back door and put on the best Im not terrified of Nazis systematically killing my neighborhood expression and opened the door. There was no one there at all. This scared me even more. I locked the door and went back into the living room. The voices of my different points of view began to argue at me, and everyone was expressing their opinion. One part of myself said I had taken too many drugs and that I might die of liver failure (something I had heard about mushrooms) one desperate voice saying that I would be fine and that I should just relax, it will all be over in a few hours, and a murmur of a thought here and a visual image there.
