I'm pretty sure that after an hour my friends had already peaked but mine is hitting in just about now. I am in my bed and look at the carpet, I see the walls which are painted blue and BANG! it hits me, my bed is actually a desert island with dinosaurs and I am a hunter who lives there. On my right is the Teacher who lives a double life as a gangster. On my left the Computer genious who's planing to control the world somehow. And we are all ''chosen'' by the mushrooms to communicate together. Know that right now I have lost all contact with reality and am sure this is true.
