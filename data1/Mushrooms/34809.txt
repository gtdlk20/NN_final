T+7:00 - All the effects are now gone and I'm going to bed, it was a very enjoyable experience which I would definitely not mind repeating it. I'm glad I didn't listen to any of my non-drug-using friends and take a smaller dose, or stay home from the mall. I then got in bed and fell asleep listening to my new cd. I had a more trippy dream that night then I usually do, but it was somewhat depressing when I think back on that dream. I'm not sure if the mushrooms actually contributed any to my dream or if it was a placebo effect where I thought they would, so subconsciously I wanted the dream to be trippy and psychedelic.
