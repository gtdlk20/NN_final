It is amazing how great of a psychoanalytic tool the mushroom can be.  All the tension that seems to build in the mind can finally be resolved.  In many respects the visuals were the least interesting part of my trip.  Rather the ability to think deeply and critically, allowing for massive strides in personal growth to take place was the most fascinating part. the ability to think deeply and critically, allowing for massive strides in personal growth to take place was the most fascinating part. But it all really depends on one's own intention.  I went into the trip with intention of having a personal psychoanalytical look at myself and that is what I got.  I dont think I would recommend psychedelics to anyone who hasnt understood its spiritual purpose.
