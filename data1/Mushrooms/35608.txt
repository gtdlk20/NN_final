I first became interested in the relationship between ethnogens-- particularly mushrooms-- and non-traditional spiritual experiences eight years ago.  Being a less than adventureous individual (read: coward), I was content for an extended period of time to pursue extensive research on the subject.  As Ralph Waldo Emmerson said, 'knowledge is the antidote for fear.'  And the more I read concerning mushrooms the less intimidated I was by the thought of 'shrooming'.
