As I ate more mushrooms, I felt a sort of electric jolt in my mouth whenever the taste felt strongest.  It seemed to come and go in waves, truly amazing.  By now we were all tripping hard and laughing loudly at many things which normally aren't that funny.  Everything was funny to us.  Even the idea that these could be bad mushrooms and we might just be poisoned (which we later realized we weren't) seemed hilarious.  Rather than worrying about the idea that we could die, we contemplated it and laughed it off easily.
