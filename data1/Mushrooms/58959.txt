All of us had ended our trips and were completly sober.  As we climbed the ladder down the stairs and out the barn door, we discussed we should now do.  As we were walking towards the house I saw a deerlike figure dash across the grass, and let out a scream, my friends were startled and ask me what I was screaming at.  As the thing came back into the house they got scared very bad.  The 'thing' ran very fast but made no noise and left no tracks. We had no idea what it could of been knowing we were in the middle of the city and deer do not come around.
