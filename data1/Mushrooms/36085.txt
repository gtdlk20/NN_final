Also, I thought a lot about my drug use. I'm not a heavy druggie, but I've tried a lot of the recreational drugs. I came to the conclusion that it is okay for me to experiment with drugs as long as I do it in a safe situation and I know what I'm getting into, but that it is EXTREMELY important that I don't let my drug use negatively effect myself or anyone else. Most importantly, I felt that I had to make sure that I never put myself in a situation where my parents would become aware of my drug use (anything beyond alcohol). I know that they would be very disapointed and the mushrooms made me realize how horrible this would be - I felt like I never would want to do anything that would disapoint them. I felt I should always be grateful to them for everything they have done for me, and that if I was to use drugs I should use them responsibly and I should always try to be kind to my parents.
