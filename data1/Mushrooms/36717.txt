I used to think I was a hardcore user who could handle anything, I took the experiences lightly just wanting to be fucked up in some way; this trip was so furious and intense that it humbled me significantly, I now am very devoted to spiritual use of natural hallucinogens like mushrooms or peyote.  I thought I was more powerful than the drug which was folly, and I got rather harshly punished by the shrooms for crap like that, The force of my own thoughts was overwhelming, but I proved to myself that I did have a strong being that was able to tolerate an experience like that and come away plussed, amazing and magical things mushrooms.
