I left the bathroom from what felt like could have been hours. I wanted to sit down, I actually felt out of my own body at the time, I wasn't aware of this until afterwards. I was curious if I actually left the bathroom at all, or if possibly my reflection is what left the bathroom and I was still in there glancing at what could be nothing. I was worried I had died and that the only thing that could make me believe I wasn't dead was to check. But I got lost along the way, I lost track of things I had planned.. it didn't feel like when I normally forget something. It felt like I forgot apart of myself back in the bathroom and I wasn't sure if it was just a peice of the jigsaw puzzle or just my imagination playing tricks on me. I looked in there and saw nothing unusual, everything was actually normal. I proceeded to go back to the couch, when I saw my back door to my backyard open. I knew that I left it open, but I wasn't sure when I did. It almost felt like it could have always been open, or it was meant to be open but it didn't matter.
