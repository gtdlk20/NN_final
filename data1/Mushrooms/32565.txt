7:30- we wanted to go into a field that lead back to the trail where we walked earlier. It was dark now, but I felt great. I blazed through the field, which had heavy bush and weeds all through it. It looked very sketchy, and I would normally have been sketched out by this dark, thick bush we were trudging through. But my body was warm, I cant explain the warmness and good feeling I had, but it was good, I could do anything. Then we sat down in a clearing, just grass. And toked up, this time I smoked. I smoked my menthols too, which I had not wanted to do at all earlier. It was a good setting, even tho it wasn't in reality. It was dark and cold out, but it was all good. The first time sitting however was extremely difficult, it was like I forgot how to sit, eventually, after 15 minutes of trying to sit down, I did it.we sat on the grass and toked and smoked for over an hour. I had a torch lighter which I swiped from a hardware store, it kept sticking up and not lighting, it began to give me an extremely bad vibe for some reason, I saw the lighter as something evil, it was out to get us all and would only bring trouble. I was very irritated by the lighter, I had to kill it, I had to get rid of it, so I threw it into the trees perhaps 5 feet away, but it was all good now, it was gone. I looked over my shoulder a couple times and saw about 20 people coming down towards us. It sketched me out solid, but nobody else could see them, it was in my head.
