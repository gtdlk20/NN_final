This tea ceremony was done with the intention to see what reality is made of, a meditative journey of inquiry rather than for fun or recreation. Setting was my bedroom with my partner, with locally sourced p. cubensis mushrooms that we know well. Music was psytrance on a Spotify playlist on our kicking home stereo system. A number of children slept blissfully unaware in the other bedrooms, with perhaps visions of sugarplums dancing in their heads? Phones on Do Not Disturb setting. King sized bed arranged with fluffy fleece blankets, lots of pillows, and a fan available in the window if needed.
