The people we were with the night before came over and gave me half a pill and some lovely liquor shots. This really did give me a boost, but I still cant understand drum and bass, no offence. I was also given some MDMA in my drink which added to the overall buzz. I did start to overheat a bit and noticed that I was sweating more than others so went outside. There were a few moments the night before on the 3mgs where I felt somewhat anxious at the heat and the amount of people. We walked back after the music and were going to go off somewhere else, but it started to rain, just as I met someone who'd known nicholas saunders and was interested in ibogaine as well.
