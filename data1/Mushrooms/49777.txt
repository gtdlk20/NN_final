About an hour after consumption I sat down at the computer to write down what has happened so far. Reflections of 2 CD-rom discs on the wall catch my eye and I start looking at them. The shadows were beautiful and interesting in some way. I sit down in the couch again to play some Dreamcast but it isn't going very well as I start laughing and staring at the 2 reflections on the wall. Me and N laugh most of the time. Short after that I went out to smoke. I started looking around and noticed that the shadows were much clearer than usual or maybe it was just that I noticed them now. About 50 meters away on someone elses land a spotted a big tree. The tree was very beautiful standing there in the night. I felt an urge to go to the tree to see what it wanted from me, but I went inside instead.
