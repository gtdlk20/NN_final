At this point in time I felt uncomfortable sensations in my mouth and limbs but I chose to ignore them and focused instead on how beautiful the lights were. In no time I was transported into a different world. The friends around me had disappeared and I was on a fancy wooden carousel. I could hear sounds of happy children in the background, as though this was a scene from my childhood. I then decided to close my eyes and that was when I fell into a trance. In this trance, I was launched into a world that was so unfamiliar and yet so magnificent, wild and beautiful. It was unlike anything that I could ever have dreamed up or visualized on my own and I consider myself an extremely creative person. I saw a lot of sexually-related images: a massive orgy, man and man, woman and woman, man and animal, woman and animal. I also saw many humans without arms and legs. There were lots of geometric shapes and fancy circles in every single colour imaginable to mankind. These shapes formed alleyways and tents and massive dance floors. However these were not just visions. I was living in that world. These humans in my visions were talking to me. Most of the time they were either inviting me to join their experience, take pictures of me or cheer me on. These people were my fans. After the whole trip ended my friends actually told me that I was talking and laughing to myself, mumbling gibberish. They were initially very worried because I was in a trance for a full hour and I was the only one in that state. I was responding to them, talking with them, posing for photographs, laughing, and acknowledging their admiration and love.
