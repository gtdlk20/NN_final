I'm rolling around on the bed in complete psychic agony.  The philisophical magnitude of my cultural definition is destroyed; I have no idea where I am, who I am, why I'm here (WHERE even?), I even forgot that I had eaten mushrooms.  I think T might be talking to me, the voice is lost on the air.  Did someone actually say something, or did I just think someone did?  Complete loss of time perception now.
