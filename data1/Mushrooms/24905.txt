I picked a girl I had known for months and with whom I was in good terms. She lived in an apartment and her father was away so we had the place to ourselves and she was interested in mushrooms. So I thought that it would be a learning experience for us both. and indeed it was. I ate the dried shrooms in chocolate pudding but amazingly the shroom taste was still there.
