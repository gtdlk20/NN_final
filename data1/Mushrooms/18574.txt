I am 38 years old and have suffered from major depressive disorder for nearly all my adult life. My depression is characterized as treatment resistant (recalcitrant), in that despite taking a wide variety of antidepressants and taking part in a variety of other therapies over the years, I am not cured. I have a family history of this general type of depression. My depression is not in the category of bi-polar or schizoaffective disorder. I also have a low level anxiety from time to time, though this is much less debilitating than the depression itself. My depression is not the 'winter blues' (SAD - seasonal affective disorder), though I do live in a northern State.
