I started wandering around the area.  There was a moderate feeling of disorientation and lack of balance.  I never fell over, but it was there.  Everything at this point was amazing, and I wandered around staring at everything in amazement for awhile.  Someone had setup some club-like light devices...one was like a discoball that sprayed out a rainbow of colors, and it was pointed up at the canopy of tree branches.  I stared.  I went back over to the campfire and sat down staring at the fire.  Someone I knew came over to me and greeted me and started talking to me.  I remembering thinking 'hello', but I don't think I actually said hello.  It was a serious mind bender.  It felt like everything was screaming for my attention, and the synergistic effect was confused amazement.  At some point the music that was being played wouldn't let me ignore it anymore, and so I ran back to the music/dance area.
