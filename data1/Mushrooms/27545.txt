Near the grassy part of the field was a narrow gravel road (about 10 feet away). Those 10 feet felt like 10 miles, it was unbelievable. It took seconds to travel there, but it felt like a great distance had been traversed. After exploring the distance thing a bit, I went to go lie down in the grass. I noticed my two friends were still gone. I was a little worried, but the crazy shit going on in my head was far more amusing.
