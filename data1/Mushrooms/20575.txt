The visuals started to distort after I left the Electric purple world. I started to see myself at birds eye again like when I was creating worlds before. But the unfolding whirling shapes this time were creating themselves. They were brightly coloured, Red, Yellow, White. They weren't coherent. I don't know what they were. They kept rolling out like some demented alien Rubiks cube. Juttering, glitching, screaming. I couldn't stop it. It felt machine-like and alien. Like I was being thrown about by colourful noisy cogs. It was speeding up. It hurt. I was beginning to feel real fear. The whirling hum was gaining speed and pitch and so were the machines movements. I felt dizzy and sick. I didn't think it could go any faster but it did and kept climbing. I started to freak out. I felt like my brain was glitching like a scratched disc. I felt like my brain was glitching like a scratched disc. I honestly thought I was going to have a heart attack or something. I kept trying to reason with myself logically that it would be fine and it would eventually stop. But I had never been to this place before, so I didn't know for sure. I was thinking about how each brain reacts unpredictably and how it is possible to get stuck in a trip I was thinking about Syd Barrett from Pink Floyd and how he got himself fried from too much experimentation with psychedllics. I tried to get up but I couldn't make sense of my blankets or what way was up. My room looked like some strange illusion. Parts of the wall jutted out through my head. Everything was twisted, out of place and unnatural. I got the light on and threw off my big eastern hoodie. Almost instantly I felt some dark energy lift off me. I remember thinking I wasn't surprised that thing had some energy attached. It was weird as hell. I looked at the time, it was eleven pm.
