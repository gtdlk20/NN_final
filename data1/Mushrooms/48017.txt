We intended to travel to M's house, a journey which under normal circumstances would take us a grand total of 15 minutes. We staggered about like madmen shouting and laughing, during the journey we were almost hit by two cars. Everybody was staring at us, we weren't just paranoid, they were. At this point time no longer had meaning and although I'm sure it took us a while to get where we wanted to go, I couldn't say how long. When we got there we were greeted by M's daughter. We actually managed to keep it together until J said 'cow' and I started laughing to myself. M's daughter looked at us suspiciously but continued to talk to us. Eventually we were offered to come in but L and I felt apprehensive and wanted to return to the sanctuary of J's house. The return journey was much the same as the initial one and left another set of bewildered passers by.
