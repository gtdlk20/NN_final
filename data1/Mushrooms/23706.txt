Once we'd returned to the stoop outside the dorm, the three of us on mushrooms broke off from the others and fell down on the grass. We watched the stars, which seemed to ooze down from the heavens. The other girls were still engaged in a laughing fit, but I found myself feeling more and more isolated. I thought about my boyfriend, who lives seven hours away in a much larger city, with whom I'd tripped several times. I had typically always tripped with my significant other of the time, as I'd found mushrooms to be a fantastic way to bond with another person. I believe that my past experiences had started to color my present trip, as throughout the night I felt myself to be a lonely half of a whole, the phantom presence of my absent partner causing me to feel increasingly depressed.
