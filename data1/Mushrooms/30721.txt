This was around 7-8 months ago, so all of the fine details wont be there but the major impacts will be. My mom and I decided to take part in a healing ceremony performed by a legitimate Shaman. Leading up to the experience, we were not allowed to consume alcohol, no food the day of (aside from a VERY light breakfast), and no other substances prior to (weed, medication, etc). Before the ceremony, we spent a few hours getting to know the other members of the group, and overall being given time to relax and become comfortable with our surroundings. We did some energy clearing, and were told to state our intentions of what we wanted Spirit to show us in our journey. A large bowl of animal spirit cards were placed face down in a bowl on the table, mixed, and as the Shaman was doing so, his card the Raven flipped right side up. The only one of the hundred plus cards in the bowl. Coincidence? Maybe. Weird? Yeah. Anyways, we went around the circle stating our intentions, mine being Spirit, Show Me A Life Lived In Strength; I chose this because I at the time felt lost in life, pretty much floating along with no real direction. My card was the Camel, which he related my intent to it as being one of the strongest and most robust animals on the planet. Kinda cool. A few hours later, it was time to drink our hot-chocolate-mushroom tea. Stirred and sipped for about 5 minutes, trying to get every last bit in. Then we waited. I sat up as straight as possible with my eyes closed until maybe 20 minutes passed and I started to feel really heavy, so I laid back on the provided mat.
