Now the energy that I felt through my head intensified and the 'wavelength,' as I call it, seemed to speed up.  The energy now felt like it was flowing above me, but was still in my head at the same time.  I got up from being relaxed in bed lying down and turned on my lamp by my bed and drank some water.  The lamp has a 40 watt bulb and points toward the ceiling, giving me a perfect soft indirect light for trips.  I tried not to drink much water, even though I felt thirsty.  DonÂ’t do that, drink lots, and see my trip tip list at the end.  I used the restroom, on the way there I was looking at everything, how real it all looked.
