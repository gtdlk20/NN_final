Now, this event may seem trivial to some, but to me it was the external sister event to my mostly internal ascension period. I had somehow brought some knowledge of myself as well as the world out of me and used it in the external world. I say this because I am highly suspect of whether or not I would have been able to have done what I did without the first part of the journey.  In my usual mental state, I imagine I would have had thoughts such as this isnt my problem or but what if I get hurt? Yet these were the furthest things from my mind in the situation.
