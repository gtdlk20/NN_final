As I walked, it felt as if I wasn't in control of my movements. I didn't feel myself walk or move in the environment I was in, it was as though I was walking  in another world. It was 4pm by the time we finally got to his house. We patiently waited out the front, lying in the grass and soaking up our surroundings. My friend and I tried holding a conversation between us, but found that we were barely able to talk, each word and sentence sounded dribbled and sloppy as a we tried desperately to communicate with one another. I sounded like a mess, and my lack of coordination and movement didn't help either.
