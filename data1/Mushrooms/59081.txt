We walked back down to go outside and smoke a bone. We had to pass the big fountain to get to the door and when we did I happened to look down at the floor. The tiles around the fountain were glossy and showed the reflection of the large skylight above. I thought to myself that if I went through the floor then I would end up on top of the skylight; so I bent down to see if my hand would go through. Casey saw me do this and he laughed a little and then we continued to walk outside.
