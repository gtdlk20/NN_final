My mind kept telling me I should be back with the other girl. The song switched and the womans voice was gone, taking the naked girl with her. I sat on the couch staring at the rug and found myself wondering what is it like to live the life of a rugof this rug?. I slid myself down to the floor and laid flat on the rug staring at the ceiling. My friends tried to talk to me and I told them to leave me alone, and treat me as if I was the rug. Someone got up from the couch and walked around me to the kitchen. I harshly yelled at them you dont walk around the rug when you need to walk over it! Dont F***ing walk around me. F***ing walk on me! I am the rug! On the way back they walked on me. I was so happy to find out a little more about the life of a rug.
