The whole 3 hour car ride, we couldn't wait to eat them, and were getting anxious to trip. The park opened at 6 and at about 7 we broke up each of our 2.5grams and wrapped them in fruit roll-ups like a burrito. I usually take an eighth, but knew from my last trip from the same batch that I wouldn't need allot.
