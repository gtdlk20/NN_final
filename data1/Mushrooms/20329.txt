I said my farewells to my friends and decided it was time to go home and attempt to sleep.  It was now approximately 3:00AM.  I put some Aphex Twin and Moby into my disc changer and listened to the infinitely complex beats of Aphex Twin and created intense patterns of light behind my eyes (it was absolutely incredible).  I listened to Moby next and I had a vision of my entire life being presented for me to review and interpret.  I saw my birth, my mother crying, my casket being lowered into the ground and my children crying.  I began to cry.  It took hold of me and sent amazing waves of emotion through my whole body and I think that I experienced bliss.  I sat in the afterglow of this event, bathing in the immense beauty of life and the amazing powers of psychedelic drugs.
