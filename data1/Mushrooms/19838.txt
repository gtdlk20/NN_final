And then it was over. The frantic panic dissolved into serene calm. Suddenly it wasn't scary anymore. I became one with the trees, the grass, the world. I felt my soul stretch towards infinity. Feeling myself becoming part of the millions of galaxies existing throughout the universe. I was seeing visions of the stars and heavens glowing brilliantly. Swirls of universes, the amazing heavens, it was more amazing than any picture of outer space that you could ever see. And I was part of it all again. It had always been like this. This was all so familiar. Something that you forget when you are alive, but once itÂ’s over you become a part of everything again and remember. And it was amazing.
