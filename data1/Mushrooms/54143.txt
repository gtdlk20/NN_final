As I closed my eyes I had another vision. It was a factory setting...highly sci-fi/alien...made of brightly coloured perspex lit from the inside. I saw my body as a frame without visceral content. My right leg was composed of this coloured perspex material with a definite yellow colour. Then the vision was gone. I looked at the gas fire...it gave me some dearly needed comfort. Then I realized I was experiencing no separation between me and the flame. I realized I could easily embrace the fire and set myself alight...so I moved away...shame it was comforting after all. Back to the madness and the storm for who know how long. I found a drawing I had received praise for and set it beside me as a sort of talisman...this seemed to work to a degree...something to hold onto. I needed to pee...but god I could hardly stand. I crawled up stairs an sat on the loo...no way was I standing to pee in this state. I urinated with my head in my hands...eyes closed and had another vision. The most beautiful forest...coloured perspex again...and a waterfall.
