I have used cubensis under many circumstances in many places, usually exotic or beautiful natural locales, but this time I was particularly interested in setting up a trip the way Terence McKenna had suggested, at night in the darkness, in a very quiet place with as little external stimuli as possible. In other words, sensory deprivation. I chose an island off the Washington coast where a friend has twenty secluded acres.
