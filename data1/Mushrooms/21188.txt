Maybe 15 or 20 minutes into Fantasia, I noticed that what I saw when my eyes were closed was much more in focus than what I saw when my eyes were open and I decided to take off those dingy readers and close my eyes. What I saw when I closed my eyes also became much more compelling. My field of vision was filled with visions of very complex and constantly changing but seemingly organized geometric patterns swirling around in deep, otherworldly pastel hues of purple, blue, and pink with veins of white separating the colors. There was a smooth flow to these patterns and there didnt seem to be any sharp edges. They seemed to exist in a space that was infinitely bigger than my living room. Occasionally, Id open my eyes and see my actual living room and the animated Fantasia animals on my television dancing to the classical music score in my headphones and Id chuckle like, Oh, right...I forgot that was happening. When I closed my eyes again and Id be back in this expansive other space with the swirling colors and patterns. Eventually my vantage point in this space slowly rose up to a great elevation and then backwards so that I was ultimately looking out over an expansive field of vision. It was at this point that I was struck with total awe.
