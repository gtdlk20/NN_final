I've always been interested in things that can help ones body and mind and I'll leave it at that ,not being a fan of substances that are bad for the body. I've smoked pot heavy through my teenage years I've done salvia once or twice and done mushrooms a few times not having any serious effects ,also never doing more that 2g (which I realized now was some weak mushrooms) and drink heavy on the weekend.
