After this, we had our first encounter with a sober one. She said hi and explained that she was sorry for sneaking up on us. We exchanged pleasantries letting her know that all was fine, and she was none the wiser of the nirvana that we had tapped into. After this, we somewhat followed her trail further into the path. We came to a clearing that deeply saddened us both. The clearing was covered with recently timbered trees. Among the trees that were stil standing, we found one that had a profund crimson color to it's bark. She suggested that we go look for the lighter again. On the trip back we walked past a family who had let their dog get ahead of them. They said they were sorry, but I didn't have a care in the world and just said it was fine. The father of the group asked me if it was a rough hike. I said yes, and also commented on the length of the trail. We then returned to the truck, which turned into yet another fruitless search for the lighter.
