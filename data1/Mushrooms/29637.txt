I got up and encountered my kitchen in absolute disarray, once again I felt the powers of abandonment and isolation staring at me. I visualized people who havenÂ’t give up and projected the forces of love on them. Images of my mother came to my mind and her unwavering drive of fighting entropy and death. I also remembered an image from a Jodorowsky film, where a carpenter who is making a lot of chairs for free responds to Jodorowsky's father that all paths lead to god, when the character portraying his father looks at him confused at this drive.
