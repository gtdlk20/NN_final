I again, just like last time asked, 'what else is to come?'  The 'Lord' let me have it this time; He could send me information mush faster than I could write.  He is very patient though, he says 'there is no room in life for ignorance' and if I didnt understand something he would keep explaining and keep explaining until I understood.  He would rather me understand, than just say I understand and move on.  I got to thinking about money.  He said, 'you do not really NEED money I then argued that the entire world is based on money, and money was required to eat and live.  I inquired about the one world currency, predicted in the end of days, and how it would be implemented since how there are so many currencies.
