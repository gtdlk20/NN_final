Time is an extremely useful tool while on shrooms. Not only can it be used to approximetly know when our trip will end or start it is also a deep-anchored link to reality. When losing contact with reality find a way to know time. When we want to lose contact with reality we lose the sense of time. When we can no longer know what time it is when we NEED to know it, we start to badtrip. However experience is also a great teacher.
