As I arrived at the kitchen I encountered my mom. I took a long breath in and tried to look as normal as possible while I went and got the cat from the room my mom was in. As I was talking to my mom and retreaving the cat I noticed that I was indeed talking very loud. I took another breath and calmed myself and returned to my room. My mom went to bed at this time and the clock now read 915. I laid down on my floor in the dead center of my room as if I was instruced by the room to do so. I stared up at my ceiling which was now bubbling to the beat of 'run like hell'. Everytime a bubble would be formed it would pop and I would cover my face in fear. As it popped I looked back at the ceiling and giggled about surviving this fiasco. I found everything at this point very very funny. The wall ended and I got up to walk around a little. I was very tired and was in no way feeling the so called 'speed' effect of the mushrooms at this point.
