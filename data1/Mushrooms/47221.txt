This weekend past, myself and several friends decided to go to Nitnat lake camping. This is a fairly secluded lake on Vancouver Island in British Columbia. I had purchased some mushroom chocolates about a week before thinking to take them that weekend. The lake was an excellent place to experience a psychedelic experience, clear skies, warm weather, very few negative vibes, untamed wilderness, wind surfers on the lake. I took my chocolates at about 1615, deep down inside I was slightly sketched that they were not going to work.
