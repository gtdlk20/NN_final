It took forever, because N could barely walk. She didn't stop laughing the whole time. I lost count of the amount of times she said, roaring laughing, 'I am on a boat. And my boat is in the IRA', and 'I am out of me bin' in her Dublin accent. She said it was just like being very very drunk, but the happy kind of drunk. She stopped at one point to have a fight with some bracken, because it had the same name as our friend's dog. J and C walked either side of N, holding her hands to help her walk. I mostly walked ahead with L, who was only 16 at the time. At one point I turned back to talk to J, saying that I wasn't coming up at all. His response was to look me in the eyes as I saw his eyes kind of slump and he said 'I'm really sorry but you saying that has just made me go even deeper'.
