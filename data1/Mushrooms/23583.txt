When I got there, I lay down on the deliciously wet wooden platform my tent was setup on, and stared up at the trees around me.  Forest or no, nature was inescapable.  Instead of conversing in that strange language of pictures and impressions, though, I just stared at it.  I began to see a complex pattern in the normally-random branches.  They webbed out in regular geometric shapes, forming an almost crystalline network of shape and form.  I was so dumbstruck by it, that I simply watched for at least half an hour.  It took many shapes, spanning like a spider's web, and rising like an impressive cathedral, among others.  I felt I was seeing through the physical form to the underlying pattern which all things are connected through.  It was like Pi, though so much more important; it was the formula which explained existence itself.
