For a moment I had the idea to call my mother, then I had the idea to call 911, then I had a very clear mental image of an EMT crew coming into my living room, and the image was accompanied by the emotion of fear that Im sure I would have really had had they actually been there. One voice, the one I recognize as being the closest to me in my sane mind or at least the part of me that wasnt corrupted by the drug, said to me You are absolutely insane right now. You are a fucking mad man. The implications, and meaning behind those words had never fully sunken in until that point and I knew that I was a schizophrenic for the time being.
