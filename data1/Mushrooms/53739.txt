As i looked out into the water, i began thinking about myself and how i had been living my life lately. My career had come secondary to socializing and i had neglected my family for the past year. I could see myself in the lake as if it had turned from glass into a mirror, showing me what i was doing in my life and how to change it. I came to the divine realization that only hard work and optimism could make me into the kind of person i wanted to be. I sat in the chair until sunrise, when i promptly marched back home and got some much-needed sleep. I had beats pounding through my head at 4 a.m. and they had since died away.
