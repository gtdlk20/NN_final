Back in the round room, you could see that peopleÂ’s trance states were deepening. Everyone was sprawled on the floor, covered in blankets, and hardly speaking at all. I tried putting on my new pair of socks, but still my feet seemed swollen and eventually I gave up, figuring I could just go bare foot for this journey. I grabbed a pillow and blanket and tried to get comfy again. At first I fidgetted and shifted, but then I started staring into the candle, and its warm light calmed me. Something was happening. There were little noises, almost inaudible, and the room seemed to shake ever so slightly. It felt like being in a space ship, that was just starting to lift off the ground. I felt like the candle was my center, the still place around which everything was in movement. I was no longer centered within myself, I had externalized my center to the candle. There were patternings of energy visible in the air around the candle, the air appeared thick like water and swirled like smoke.
