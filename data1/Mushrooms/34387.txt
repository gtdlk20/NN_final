A couple of minutes later, my cell phone rang. It was relatively easy to talk; I was surprised at that. It was a kid from my school asking me whether I knew something about some project. I went back to my computer, and started listening to 'Echoes' by Pink Floyd. It was really relaxing and made me think of diving underwater. My phone rang again, and this time when I picked it up I saw my arms. They were green and felt like tentacles going out to grab something. This kind of startled me. This time it was one of my friends asking for a telephone number. I gave it to him with relative ease. After this I left my room and went downstairs to get a Coke. Doing this felt like I was in a dream, or like playing a first person shooter video game; my arms stretched out unrealisticly to grab the Coke. Everything seemed to look slighty unreal. The coke tasted very good, but I didn't care. It was like feelings of 'good' were just animalistic interpretations.
