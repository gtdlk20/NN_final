11:00pm - Back in the room we tried to have sex again.  At times it felt like everything was working and other times it wouldnÂ’t.  I buried my face in her neck and would see the outline of her face as rainbows and I could only see images of her blurred back and forth like my hands were doing earlier.  I managed to think that some movies had managed to get that experience correct.  This was one of the most beautiful color experiences that I had.  I had to go to the bathroom again so we decided to go outside.  I remember running into a friend of mine and making some rather incoherent comments about mushrooms and then I melted into a little ball and flowed out across the floor and got back up just fine.  He seemed pleased and I left him to his own devices.  I walked down the hall and ran my hands along the wall.  The texture on the wall seemed to make this tone in my head that I could control as I touched the wall. I remember thinking something about 300hz sounded right.  The snow outside was positively invigorating.  I immediately ran outside and frolicked in it.  I jumped in it on my back and my face and wasn't cold at all.  I could tell it was cold but wasn't worried.  I touched and felt the old trees outside and was totally immersed in how amazing a tree was.  Little depressions in the snow were fabulously interesting and I felt like I was Alice traveling down the rabbit hole.  I realized I was wet from the snow and we went back inside.
