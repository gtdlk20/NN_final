I stepped out into the blustery night. The clouds of the day were being hustled away by a brisk wind revealing clear stars. I somewhat comically flopped face-down onto the lawn and communed with the cool, soothing wet grass. It felt wonderful to be connected so closely to the earth, to smell the soil. It was then that I noticed the wind; I was having aural hallucinations; the wind (specifically it moving through the birch trees) was making a rushing, graduated shwwwshwwshwwshww that would ebb and rise in intensity. It wasnt the smooth way one would hear wind, it was staggered. I have once heard someone emulate this sound with alarming accuracy, it was on a UK-made Documentary about the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and there was a moment in the doc where the chaps are making swishing noises electronically, no doubt at the direction of Jimi, trying to manifest the sounds he experienced on his trips. I of course realized how abnormal hearing sound this way was, and I began to foster the idea that I had gone insane.
