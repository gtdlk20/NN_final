The rest of my trip was only an extension of that.  I realized that the entire trip I had been feeling like I had no group or hard description for who I am.  Some people are from a place like Arkasas.  I am from nowhere.  Some people are part of something or can be described as something like a skater or a punk.  I used to be, but now I am not.  Well, I am, I am Adam-thinking.  I have parts as does everyone else.  Some people are Person-expressing, such as artists.  Some are Person-faking, there are lots of these.  Some are Person-understanding, like Siddhartha Guatama-understanding.
