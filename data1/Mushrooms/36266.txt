When we stopped at a light on campus the music disapeared and I began to hear a voice in my head.  I smoke a lot of pot so I'm used to hearing vivid music and crystal clear vioces in my head so I didn't mind it.  I looked at one of the buildings on campus and admired its architecture.  I can remember the voice telling me 'You're going to be ok, just relax and enjoy.'  At this point I was actually wondering if I was tripping.  I kept thinking 'What is a trip? What is tripping?'  Then I reached up and pinched myself because of course I was tripping.
