I ended up back upstairs in the room of the particularly intense wallpaper, this time in the dark. I dont remember what exactly we spoke about but what I do recall was that every time I thought something, it seemed that for the first time, I was really considering things and not just on a surface level. I gained new insight into situations and people. I got a strong urge to speak to emma so I phoned her on Martinas phone. I got through to the voicemail, which did something really strange to me. I was in a dark room but it felt vast when I started to leave a message. My speech felt faltering and I imagined emma and martina in the darkness of the room, watching me and listening to me. It felt very much like I was being judged for something I wasnt aware of.
