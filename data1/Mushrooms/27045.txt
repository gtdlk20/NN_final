In Buddhism they often talk about grasping and aversion, and being neither attracted nor repelled by experience, thoughts or emotions. This is important in life and, now I am certain, a necessity in death. That instinct that I had to hold on and stay in this world and not give in to what the drug was doing to me was the source of all of my negative emotions. IÂ’m sure that is exactly how I would have responded if I was really dying. It left me in a world that was devoid of presence and completely ruled by fear, confusion, and regret. I think this could have really been some form of hell. Once again, I am grateful for this experience, I have a clearer picture of what I need to work towards in this life, and also a few guidelines and ideas as to how I can go about achieving these things.
