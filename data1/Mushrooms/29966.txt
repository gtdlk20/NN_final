After our late dinner, for it was after 10pm at this point, the five of us spent the tail end of the trip outside by the big circular fountain where sunset had us spellbound hours earlier. An enormous cloud moved in front of the moon, alternately cutting its light. Wes and Jimi laid on the edge of the fountain, flat on their backs so as to better observe the sky. Albus passed around a pair of binoculars. At some point, he and Manny walked a few yards away to, of all places, the clearing where Id had my dialogue with the trees. The three of us still by the fountain could hear them chatting merrily in the distance.
