I started to feel uneasy and paranoid because I was supposed to go to a movie and eat barb-b-que. I cant be all fucked up around my friends I thought,  they will defiantly know I'm high on shrooms, so I tried to hide from them in my room. While I  was on my way back to my room, I started to take in all effects. The whole world got really freaky and almost too dream like for what I was wanting. I laid on my bed  and listened to some shins to snap me out of what was becoming my first bad trip. I experienced color disproportion like I had never experienced before (or ever with my other friends who were really big shroom heads and take more than I ever had 4-5 grams) I saw an gorgeous arrangement of swirling visuals that not only were there when I closed my eyes but when I opened them too. It was there all the time. But in the middle I was seeing faces that smiled at me, then frowned then started to laugh. Around me the everything had the capability of forming into messed up evil faces. I thought god damn it I'm having a really bad trip.
