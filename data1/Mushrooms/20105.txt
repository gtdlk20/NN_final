The single word to encompass my whole experience is big.  Everything seemed so huge and involved, and there was so much information to know.  If I saw a black chair, I immediately thought, Why is it black? Why is it a chair? What makes a chair a chair? Where did the idea of a chair come from? Chair, thats a funny word.   The processes of my mind could not keep up with all the questions I had and everything I wanted to know.  I felt confined by having to put my thoughts into words, and I began to see the limits and problems with language.  I realized that everyone has their own unique perspective that defines how they interpret that world, and it is extremely difficult to give that perspective to someone else to make them understand how you interpret the world. I felt like nothing was worth feeling bad about.  I remember being very cold at one point while I was waiting to enter the planetarium and the A/C was cranked way up.  I didnt lament that I was cold; I decided to explore that feeling and see what it was all about.
