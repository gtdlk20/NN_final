While coming up, I felt a sense of discomfort in my abdomen, as well as anxiety, and a chill throughout my body. About half an hour after entering the class, I noticed that anything glass would wave, and something was wrong with the overall context of my situation. The saying 'a fish out of water' came to me, and then I started to believe that I could be a fish. We were supposed to be working on a worksheet for the play Othello. The teacher said to 'split into groups'. I could not grasp this concept. I sat at my desk, alone, and wondered why I was so alone. I could not understand why the 'teacher' in front of me had such control over the humans. I convinced myself that it was a large conspiracy, and that the kids in front of me were from the matrix. When the bell rang, seventy five minutes later, I decided to create an illusion, and follow the kids out the door. I discarded a blank sheet of ripped paper into the recycling bin. I had been very sure that it was evidence against me.
