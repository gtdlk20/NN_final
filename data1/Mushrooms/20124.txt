So much to know.  So much.  How can i understand it all?  So beautiful.  I want to keep it with me.  Words are too concrete.  Its hard to think about it.  Its easy to think about the mundane.  No, there is no mundane.  There are no boundaries.  So much. So much.  I want to know it all.  I want to feel it all.
