I started explaining every aspect of society and media out loud for hours, feeling as if I had had a major discovery. I felt as if I had figured out how the world really works, and how people really are. I was still seeing colors and morphing, and it was about 2:00 a.m. I closed my eyes and thought about something red, and when I opened my eyes, everything looked red to me. So I thought of something blue, and to my amazement, everything looked blue. It seems that what ever color I thought of, everything I saw turned that color. I did this for about 20 minutes, and that was when I checked my eyes to see my pupils. One of the girls had told me earlier that they were 'geckoed' meaning the pupils were huge, and I had looked in the mirror to find out for myslef. My pupils had gone back to normal, and the morphing was gone, and the colors had gone away too. I was finally able to sleep at about 2:30 a.m.
