I wrote in a notebook, but the thoughts still felt very loopy. I was hoping to capture some wisdom - but part of me felt that whatever I caught would be lingering shadowy aftereffect (whatÂ’s the word for the form of a thing left behind after it has left a physical space?). Still, I wrote a bit, and left myself a treasure map of sorts.
