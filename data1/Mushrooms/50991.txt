For about an hour to an hour and a half I kinda just lounged around, tripping out on how the music was intensifying and the color change and visuals and such. During this time I was also contemplating how I could make my life better, and how I felt like I had some much more to offer the world than this little dirt town could offer me. I also rolled two joints :)
