Next to see were the Fur Seals. After almost getting caught in a large net hanging from a pole (we were sure it must have been put there to catch people who were high) we went into the underwater viewing area. The seals were amazing animals to watch and we managed to get there attention several times and make them spin around in the water while right in front of us. At this point I started to talk to Tim about the seals. Since he wasnt tripping and I was he decided to screw with me and started telling me that the seals were here to put on a strip show for us. At the time it seemed like the stupidest idea ever and I immediately told him that the seals couldnt strip since they lacked clothing. Tim replied by saying they would just peel off their skins. This got a disgusted look from me and I immediately walked away and told Esther Im not talking to Tim anymore hes being disgusting.
