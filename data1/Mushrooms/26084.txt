Several aspects of my previous ego death kept coming to my head. I kept having the feeling that somehow my dad was looking over my shoulder, asking me something, I cannot quite remember what, it was somewhat of a vague whisper. Random sentences of every-day life kept popping to my head. Computer related sentences (Click here to apply the patch!), standard commercial taglines (Now 40% less fat!), very common phrases used by teachers at school, etc. All in a very random order really.
