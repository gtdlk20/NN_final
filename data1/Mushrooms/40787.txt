6:15 Now that I was out of the room, I had a service connection on my phone, so managed to call my wife (amidst my visual distortion of the phone screen) to come and make sure everything was safe and to talk for me in case someone did come. With my very disoriented attention span, I told her my employer was outside and that I was afraid, and how beautiful the sunset sky was, and how she reminded me of family, and that I was freaking out. She was responding calmly and being totally acceptant of my plea for help. She had been at her parents house because she wanted to totally avoid me while I was tripping, but she knew I needed her, so she came to my rescue. She said Im on my way, going 45 on [a country back road] and I replied Oh you dont have to go fast, just be safe thinking 45mph was like 85mph, because I had little concept of numbers. She soon arrived and came to the back of the house where I was waiting, and I was so relieved she came, yet ashamed that I had to involve her.
