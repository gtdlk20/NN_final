All of my freinds were suprised at the extreme intensity of my trip, but I wasn't- I'm one of those rare ppl who can have pseudo-hallucinations (it's a hallucination and u are aware of it) on pot. (on the previous camping trip I was 'forced' to smoke like 4g to myself and heard the trees talking for almost an hour.)
