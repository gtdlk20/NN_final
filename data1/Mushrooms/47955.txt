My thoughts, senses, ideas, questions, perception, all took on this radical notion of human geometricity. As I lied, sprawled out on the cool, wet grass, my vision became coated with geometric patterns that I never knew my brain had the nature to produce. Colored lines in the millions swam in symmetrical, fractal means before my visual field. From depths of my brain, beyond my control, were birthed these incredibly complex mathematical functions, lied out before my eyes and far, far away from my comprehension. Was I too weak minded to conceive these ideas without the aid of foreign organics? The American paradigm was non-inclusive of radical ideas like this.
