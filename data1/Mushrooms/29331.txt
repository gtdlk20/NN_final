Increasingly, it feels like an initiation. Increasingly, it feels like an initiation. Still pacing the room and chanting, now strong feelings of deepest sanctity. A knight templar reincarnate, finding the holy grail. Bowing in front of the altar, repeatedly. Being the dream of a yogi who is meditating for a billion years. Time has become meaningless. Holy creation.
