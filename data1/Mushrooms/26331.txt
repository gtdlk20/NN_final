9:30pm - I got back into the dorm room and our friends all decided to go outside and walk around.  My girlfriend was tripping too hard and didn't feel comfortable going outside so we lay down in her bed and the trip really took off.  We lay on my girlfriend's bed for the next half hour talking about how we were feeling.  I remember letting my eyes relax and watching the christmas lights in the room all fuzz into distorted haze.
