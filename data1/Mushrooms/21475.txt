I started having intense time distortions and dilations.  Some things would seem to take forever. Other things, I would hear in the house, go into a buzzed state, only to come back to the exact same sound starting over. Sometimes it would repeat very slowly. Other times, it was staccatto and fast, like the face movement in the Matrix movie when an Agent took over a body.  Eventually, I lost all time and I was stuck at approximately 4am forever. I don't mean '4am seemed to take forever' but more like 'time ceased to exist for me at 4am' I remember thinking to myself that when I came down, I would have no way to hold, mentally, the millions of years I was experiencing at 4am, with all time stopped, because it wouldn't stay in my mind.  And it's true..that moment of frozen time (a milisecond? Millions of years? Without time, measures of time are meaningless) is very dream-like and hard to hold in my head.  I had a lot of thoughts in that moment, but I cannot accurately recall many of them.
