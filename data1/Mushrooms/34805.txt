T+5:00 - Auditory effects are definitely starting to go away a lot, visuals are going too. I'm getting somewhat depressed the effects are going, and we are walking to S's truck now to go home. It's 9pm now and the stores are closing soon anyway. The ride home was fun, I was staring at the headlights of the oncoming traffic the whole time, we listened to my favorite band on the way home, one of S's top 10 but not his favorite he seemed to have enjoyed himself about as much as me even without any drugs.
