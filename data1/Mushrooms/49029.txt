We reluctantly return to the outside world which my mind now remembers as a cold and unfriendly place. In a short alley we spot a smashed up computer with all the electronic boards ripped out and marvel at the utter complexity of their design. It seems like some bizarre, hi-tech alien artifact. At 4:30 we part with P (who believes he is fit to go to work on mushrooms, granted he had less than the two of us.), and me and J find solace in a fast-food restaurant where we had an hour-long conversation spanning nearly every conceivable subject we could think of, and the world made perfect sense.
