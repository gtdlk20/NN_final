The best way to grow shrooms is to grow a species which is native to your climate.  When you've fruited as many caps as you can, just throw the spawn outside and let nature do the rest.  Two species which are particularly hardy are P. Cubensis in warm climates, and P. Cyanescens in temperate areas like the Pacific Northwest.
