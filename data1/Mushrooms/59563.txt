When we came back in Li√®ge, we changed our minds and decided to separate us (boys with boys and girls with girls). That evening i was sleeping at T's house, and his parents were out. We first smoke a big-sized joint, then we ate the dried shrooms (it was a 4 persons portion) plus some mexicans (cubensis, too, i think). They kicked quickly and i started to feel VERY light, and it began to grow in intensity, then i get really scared because i though i wasn't in reality and everything i lived in my life has been an illusion, so i really freaked out. T tried to calm me down but i didn't want to believe him because he wasn't real. After a while, i entered in a good trip and all really became fantastic. I think the quick mental-state modification was the real cause of that panic attack.
