We then began to create art, and we would feed off each others creations, and add.  We found leaves and glued them into our sketchbooks and drew from their random coloration as flowing inspiration.  The best thing about drawing and coloring while tripping is that you dont have to think about, every movement makes sense and comes natural, and you like it, you dont second guess your drawing, and you appreciate your creations more.
