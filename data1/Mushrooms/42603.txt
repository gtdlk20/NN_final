'What the hell am I doing?' I thought. For some reason I couldn't break this cycle of flip-flopping between going to my bed and continuing to use the computer. I have never experienced thought loops before, so this confused me and made me feel very vulnerable to the mushrooms' potential dark side. I eventually persuaded myself to lie down and so I went straight to my bed, computer still up and running, and laid face-down with my head in my hands. I closed my eyes and this is where the downward spiral began.
