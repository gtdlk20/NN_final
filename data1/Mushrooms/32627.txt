Quetzalcoatl Encounter - I started off by meditating on my bed for about a ten minute period at most.  I then saw a distinct figure in my meditation, the snake god of the Aztecs and several indigenous tribes of Mexico, Quetzalcoatl.   He started off way in the distance, and slowly came closer, and he was different than I had imagined.  His body was a complex multitude of polygons, all in a swarming block formation, like a RubikÂ’s Cube, but instead it was in all directions.  He had filled my closed eye vision, and there were colors everywhere.  He then lifted me up and showed me his face.  He looked like a huge dragon, and peered into my face.  He had a face that I would estimate to be like the size of a small single story house.  He then gripped me and lifted me up, but ever so gently.
