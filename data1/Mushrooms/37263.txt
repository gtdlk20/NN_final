By the time I'd got up to my friend's house the mushrooms were kicking in, we chose a lighthearted film to watch and sat in the back garden with a laptop, laughing and joking, as we do. About half way through the film (must have been 3am) we went inside and into his kitchen where things began to go downhill.
