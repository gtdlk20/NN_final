approx 10:45 I am so immersed in the experience that it is becoming terrifying.  We hug but I feel our limbs going through each other.  The blankets have been transformed into air filled velvety billowing pillows.  I shut my eyes again and am overwhelmed as psychotic cartoon mechanical cheeleaders with pompoms descend upon me and begin systematically tearing me to pieces.  I hold on for dear life for what seems like a few seconds, but actually turns out to be about 20 minutes.
