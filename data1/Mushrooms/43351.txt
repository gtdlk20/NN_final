The music of the festival also brought an inspiration to me. The group playing was the Skatalites. They consisted of about 10 people playing different instruments ranging from keyboard to saxophone. Individually, they all played their part in producing music. Their collaborative efforts produced a song, a whole. To a normal person this song is merely one object. To the trained ear one can pick out individual parts of an object, the keyboard, the saxophone, the trombone, and listen to each one individually. Therefore this one song is actually many pieces put together, much like a puzzle, to form one. I began to think about life, humans, nature. When viewing earth, nature can be seen as this one object. But with closer scrutiny, there are millions of parts to it. Everyone and everything on earth had its own job to do. Much like the musicians on the stage, each had their own part to play. Each one had their own thing to do. For example, the drummer was meant to keep time and rhythm; its what the drummer was meant to do  drum and nothing else. It had a purpose, much like everything else had a purpose. I tried to think of what mine was but I couldnt think of one (lol). Once I had finished thinking about everything, I felt an overwhelming sense of what I can only describe as oneness. I felt connected to everyone and everything at the festival and I was happy
