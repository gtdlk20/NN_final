Again I threw myself about my bed and began playing with my nose, lips, and face. I never realized how much fun playing with your own face could be. I did this for another 5 minutes or so, until I realized that it was nearly 3:30, and that school was going to be soon. What seemed like a mere minute after I closed my eyes, I was awoken by my mother. Getting out of bed I noticed unusual aftereffects. By unfocusing my eyes, I could see odd little things moving about everywhere. So I stayed home from school and slept all day.
