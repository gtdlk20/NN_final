I had a dinner party last night followed a bit later with a mushroom trip. Six of us tripped, four of whom had also had dinner with us, which finished at around 9PM. The other two (letÂ’s call them 'John and Lana') joined us at around 10:30, when I began making the tea. I boiled water, let it stop boiling, put it in a teapot with mushrooms, some lemon juice to help with the extraction and some ginger for flavor and to calm the stomach, a combination that has worked well for me in the past.
