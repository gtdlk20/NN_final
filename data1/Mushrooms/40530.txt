7.23pm Now I realised that this was not going to be a light trip and I could feel pressure building in my head and behind my eyes. Nausea was still there, I knew I was not going to be sick, but felt bloated with indigestion like feeling. Time dilation was also taking place and time passed very slow, six minutes felt like 45 minutes.
