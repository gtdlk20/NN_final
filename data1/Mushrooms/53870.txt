After that I sat on the bed, leaning back against the headboard, holding K. At first I was kind of watching tv but then I forgot about the tv. I was feeling very good, thinking about my family and friends, and K and the dog were snuggling up against me. I closed my eyes, felt at one with K, and meditated effortlessly. It was one of the most content times of my life. I simply felt good; I was calm but not tired. Again I had feelings of love toward K, the feeling that I am falling in love with her. I still feel that way now, three days later. Eventually I got tired, brushed my teeth, and went to bed.
