THIS LIFE IS NOT REAL.  We have seen the truth.  We have seen the universe.  When I smoke the DMT it will release me into the next life.  I can enjoy this life.  It doesnt FUCKING MATTER.  Honestly.  I can end it at any time.  It is only an illusion that this life matters.  I finally fucking understand.  Take DMT  1 time.   And the entire universe collapses into nothingness.  You can enjoy this life. You can do anything you fucking want to do and it doesnt mater because its all an illusion.  You were going to say goodbye to your wife because you realized that it was all an illusion.  Any time you want to end this illusion you can.  You can turn it into anything you want to turn it into.
