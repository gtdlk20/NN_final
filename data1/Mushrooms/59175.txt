Eventually, not too far away from the train bridge near my house, we sat down to rest. I packed a bowl and we looked at the sky. There was a lot of stars visible that night, and northern lights as well. We sat looking at them for awhile, and I felt very privileged that the powers that be felt us to be worthy of witnessing this spectacle. It was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. We were mostly surrounded by nature and it was easy to ignore the city and, for awhile, I was able to forget or pretend that human beings never existed and never fucked up the earth and never did all the bullshit that we as a species have done. It seemed like the northern lights were surrounding us like some kind of protective aura, generated by our heightened energies, and I felt like I had a place in the universe.
