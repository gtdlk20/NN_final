I looked to my left and saw a dog staring at me.  This is wierd, I thought; its almost like it knows that I'm on shrooms, or that I can communicate with it.  We maintained eye contact for a while and then the dog went berzerk.  Without any provocation from me, it started violently barking and growling at me, spitting hatred at me.  I was so scared I literally jumped up into the air and shuddered violently in fright.   Luckily the owner came and took the dog away, but before I could prepare, another dog came walking by with its owner trailing behind a bit.  This dog also maintained eye contact with me, but seemed somehow more timid than the other one, almost as if it were frightened by me.  Both dogs continued to look back at me as they disappeared into the distance of the field.
