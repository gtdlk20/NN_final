Soon after this my lazy lounging was interrupted by a more insistent CEV: in noteworthy salvia fashion I saw 'myself' as a dark brown wooden structure, located on a shelf full of identical dark brown structures. The image is unclear now, as it was only a brief flash in the first place, but I instantly picked up that it represented my life and how alone I actually am at the moment. Suddenly it occurred to me with crystal clarity that I donÂ’t have any real best friends anymore. This realisation stung me momentarily but did not sully my trip. 'I have chosen to be this alone', I thought to myself, and it felt good and cleansing to face up unequivocally to my solitary state.
