We reached a point where I could feel I was about to peak.  We could see a field beyond a row of trees.  I was losing my hold on everyday distinctions, but I was pretty sure we'd be on someone's property.  A car pulled into a driveway behind us, and we pushed through the trees, not wanting to be seen.
