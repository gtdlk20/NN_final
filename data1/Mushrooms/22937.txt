So I struggled back to my bed, worried that my parents would see my leaning against the hallway wall to keep my balance. When I got to my computer, I had a difficult time reading because the words were moving across the screen. While interesting, it wasn't helpful towards what I was trying to do at the moment. I saw that I had new replies on my Reddit account and with great difficulty managed to read parts of them. I remember one guy saying that he didn't think boys and girls could be friends because that's not how the world works. I'm not sure if it was in reply to that statement or something else altogether, but I remember saying that I don't care what the world is like. I'm going to change it all to suit my liking for the brief time I spend here.
