My moods changed from extremely happy to scared off and on. We found a gazeebo and thats when everything turned into a nightmare. The trees and vines all began turning evil and wicked. I was dehydrating and started having a bad fucking trip. My freind came to the rescue with water and I felt like I was on top of the world again.
