I thought I was coming down (yeah right), so I went into the living room and grabbed the TV remote. I had digital cable with all the bells and whistles, so my remote was very colorful and confusing with lots of buttons. It looked a lot like some weird alien technology and I could not read any of the buttons. It took me a while of fumbling with it to get the TV to come on. Once I turned it on, I dont know what I was watching, but it was about me. I changed the channel, and it was a story that somehow was a metaphor for my life. No matter what channel I viewed (and I had a lot of channels) the show was about me, directed at me, or was somehow a metaphor for my life. I found this very odd and laughed a bit about it. I knew that I had taken mushrooms and that this was not actually real. But unlike a dream that fades once you realize its not real, this persisted. I relaxed and watched some sitcom about me and then switched to the news about me. It was really strange. It was as if I was in a completely different world and I was the center of attention.
