Then as the death thoughts started to get louder this presence started to emerge. Similar to the presence of a DMT trip, this presence was all around me and felt unlike anything on earth. It felt old, ancient and from a different universe. I refer to this presence as the mushroom godhead, and in an almost angry voice the godhead asked me what I wanted to receive and how dare I summon him. This sent the death thoughts into overdrive and for some reason I thought that if answered incorrectly I would really die.
