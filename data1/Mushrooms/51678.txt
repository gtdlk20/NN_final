Ian returned to the riverside woods and my ex and I sat raving in a streetlamp aura like maniacs.  We had taken some vitamin C because of what we had heard about how it makes it better.  I subsequently had the bottle in my sweatshirt pocket.  I started thinking then for the first time about how she had screwed that other guy because she started saying that she could not differentiate between there and where she goes to school.  Well, she was trying to say that but it kept coming out that she couldn't tell the difference between me and her fling-buddy.  I didn't care at this point, I thought that it didn't matter because it happened, oh well.  Then I turned and in my hood I saw LONG blonde hair next to my face, like her fling-buddy had.  I thought suddenly that I was him and he was me.  The reason that she had confused the two places was due to the fact that he did things like go insane on drugs and her image of me was always a little more conservative, although I am quite the opposite.  Well, I suddenly became filled with the idea that this guy and I were one complete person and we were individuals of a single human side.  He was happy, goofy, joking, flirting.  I was romantic, serious, thinking, loving.  We became one at that moment.
