What followed over the next thirty minutes was perhaps the most amazing experience I've had using drugs. With these constant rushes which changed and varied in intensity came the most fantastic visuals. The whole room came to life, colors and sounds became intensified in time with the music, lights and objects took on new dimensions which made them so interesting I almost felt as though I had entered a different world. I felt childlike once more, taking pleasure in even the most simple objects and patterns. I almost felt reborn, into a much more beautiful world filled with the most amazing lights, sounds and colors. I distinctively remember tribal patterns with Aztec-like faces covering the walls. Objects, materials, patterns all started to sway gently. I felt a new brilliance in life, I could go on forever discribing the things I saw however I'll just say that it was completely unreal and at that point the saying 'A brave new world' took on a very real meaning.
