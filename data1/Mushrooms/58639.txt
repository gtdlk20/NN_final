About 2 hours into it we went outside and it was raining and it looked like colorful crystals falling from the sky and they would reflect off the christmas lights. I was hungry but food tasted old and drinks tasted flat so my appetite was completly teased. The whole high lasted 7 hours and all I did was lay down for the most part of it. Colors spiralled around the room and faces bent and walls were wavy opening locks on a door was a challenge. I was hopeless, I felt like nothing, I felt weak but I felt determined to keep a positive state of mind. So we turned on americas funniest home videos and I remember watching one that the guy said this is what it sounds like when you rewind your cat and it just tripped me out cuz it sounded like rewinding a tape recorder but it was a cat. I guess overall it helped me get out of thinking I was in hell.
