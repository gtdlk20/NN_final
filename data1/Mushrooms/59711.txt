Sept  23  Checked for signs of growth again today.  The jar that showed signs of growth the yesterday doesnt worry me anymore.  The mycelium is that trade mark brilliant bright white of the cubensis and is now becoming rather thick.  I think the reason it looked so grey yesterday was because of how thin the stuff was.  I now assume this was the jar the syringe plunger slipped on because of the incredibly fast growth.  I wish I had ordered more spore syringes so I could do that to all the jars.  After the first batch when I make my own syringes I will do this to all the jars.  This fast colonization has to be an all around plus.  This fast strong growth has to eliminate the potential for infection of the cake and it gets you shrooms faster.  The next batch I plan to do this to at least a majority of the jars.  Not to be overshadowed by this amazing discovery 6 more jars shows sign of growth but nothing that incredible just the usual spots of growth you see with just 5 days.  I now have 7  ½ pint jars beginning colonization.  All is as planned with bonuses.
