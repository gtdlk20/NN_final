Even though I had lived on this (perfectly straight) road for over 10 years, I couldn't easily identify which direction led home.  My intuitive sense of direction was lost and I had to rely strictly on memory of landmarks to guide me.  Without much memory of the walk back, I found myself in my home, greeted by my dogs, who seemed a little unsure of how to react to me in my state (but that was just my impression).
