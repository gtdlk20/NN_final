Every single tree and bush became a mockery, or imitation of humans.  They stood high, with their branches in the air, seeming like weapons.  They seemed threatening.  I began to wonder if this was perhaps the animals, or the gods, or some force trying to communicate to us in the only way they could, by showing us how THEY saw us.  Crude, hard material with nothing but hatred in their hearts.  As you can see, I was tripping balls, and it wasn't heading the right direction.
