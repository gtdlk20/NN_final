First effects were noted at T+ 30 minutes.  I felt really stoned, similar to the feeling of marijuana.  The mental effects started to kick in at T+ 45 minutes, with lots of euphoria, and a feeling that I was not responding to the world, someone else was.  The mushrooms had little waves, where over the course of about 30 seconds I would feel normal, then start tripping out, trip out a lot and then suddenly feel normal again, only to repeat the process.  I started noticing some visuals - the light on the ceiling had a bright aura around it, and the walls and ceiling were distorted, not seeming to meet at right angles.  We decided to go out for a walk.
