At a few points I had to venture inside to use the restroom. Mirrors were awfully intersting to look at. At some point, every person who fried ventured into the bathroom once and got lost in the mirror. The actual process of going to the bathroom was also interesting. As soon as the flow started immediate bubbling up of the ground and boiling of vision was intense. Add this to the fact I was in a bright bathroom after I'd been sitting in a pitch black environment for two hours with saucer eyes, and everything was absolutley shimmering gold and silver and bubbling and boiling all over the place. A gaze into the mirror and you were locked looking at yourself, while everything around you respectivley did their own crazy thing, thoughts would flood your mind. Beautiful ones, almost always good and happy.
