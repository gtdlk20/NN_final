As I stared into my face I was suddenly overwhelmed with peace and contentment.  Compared to my time in the living room where I didn't know too much of what was going on, except that I was tripping, I now came to a realization.  I was no longer worried in the least about the possibility of getting caught in a bad trip, and suddenly felt totally liberated.  I was free to do whatever I wanted.  Everything in my world was something to learn from and to experience, and no matter what happened, I would always be fine.  I gained a new level of confidence in myself.  Standing there looking into the mirror, I felt nothing but complete trust in myself and in whatever I should choose to do in my life.
