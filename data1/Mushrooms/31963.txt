The big day had finally arrived. There was L, R, J and myself.  L had scored some mushrooms; he had about 10 grams for four of us to split.  We each consumed roughly 2.5 grams.  We were in Ls small backyard garage.  It wasnt so much a garage anymore; L had successfully turned it into a decently liveable space with a few couches and a TV. It was a Friday night and L had consumed the same batch of mushrooms a few weeks earlier, L warned us these mushrooms were fairly strong.  R and J, my two other friends, including myself, were all doing mushrooms for the first time.  L laid the mushrooms on a small wooden table centered between all four of us, an eerie nervousness swept upon us.  In retrospect being nervous is a sign of respect. None of us planned on doing these drugs for reasons of self-gratification, in the traditional sense of scoring a buzz.  We were aware of the powerful affects and the potential dangers these substances possessed.  Nervousness is a good a thing!
