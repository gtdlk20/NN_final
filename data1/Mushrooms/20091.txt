After strolling around the island awhile, we ended up chilling on a long pier that stretches out into a shallow, glass-clear ocean.  It was quiet time, and everyone sat by themselves and stared off into the distance.  I felt very tranquil, and I noticed that the ripples in the water looked very cool.  About 45 minutes later it was time to go, and I was pretty much back to my normal self.  I did not feel tired or drained, and I followed the experience up with a night of heavy drinking.
