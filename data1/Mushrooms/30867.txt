I live on an island in Southeastern Alaska surrounded by natural beauty that renders the poets speechless. Growing up here I began, after high school graduation, experimenting with Clearlight LSD and had many (I mean many) experiences of profound beauty and wonder. I had only one frightening experience during my early exploration. This event caused me to reassess my curiosity for several weeks, but after careful analysis and prayer I worked through this episode and proceeded more carefully. This was such new territory.
