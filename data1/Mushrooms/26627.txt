So anyway, this DUI put me on probation, and as some of you might know, this means that the local juvenile authorities are entitled to search the residents (my) house randomly to make sure he/she doesnt possess any illegal or scheduled substances.  My mom figured I better rid myself of the equipment to void myself from any legal technicalities.  I agreed with her, but I didnt want to just throw the stuff away.  Hell that equipment took me about two months to save up for.  It was damn near a $700.00 investment when it came down to it.  So the next day, my girlfriend suggested that I store the equipment at her house.  She said her parents would be none the wiser and it would be completely cool if we just kept it all boxed up in her closet.  She said, My mom never goes into my room, I swear.  So, I stupidly put her at risk (damn I wish I could somehow use my hein sight as foresight.)  Although, later on we decided sense we werent going to become interested in the hobby again for quite some time, we might as well sell it to a friend of ours, or at least let him hold onto it and use it until we needed it back.  The equipment, which entailed all the jars (some that still had vermiculite and brown rice flour in them but were not inoculated), syringes (full of fresh spores), and everything else you need and stuff you dont to grow mushrooms, sat in her closet for about five days which brings us back to a week from yesterday.
