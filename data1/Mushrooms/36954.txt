We had been staying on Wua Talap, Ang Thong Island for about 3 days enjoying ourselves immensely and immersing ourselves in meditation when we decided to ingest our little bag of magic that we had brought with us from Chiang Mai.  I didnÂ’t quite know what to expect given that I had never really had a strong experience on Psilocybin mushrooms.  We all at 5g dried at around 1:30pm on a somewhat overcast day.  We all took them at the bungalow we had just moved to since we had been camping on a secluded corner of this amazingly beautiful beach.
