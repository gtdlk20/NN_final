Nervously, I told nick that I had to go and I closed my phone very slowly. Could my mom have heard what I was saying and known that I had taken mushrooms? Was she going to then sit me down after school tomorrow? This must be the explanation for why she was so annoyed, because she seemed considerably more upset than she usually did when I was on the phone too late. My mind began to race and for a short eternity I was so completely confused and anxious. I knew what to do! I could text message Nick, and ask him if I had been talking too loudly. I was sure he would reassure me, and I could continue on with what had started as a good trip.
