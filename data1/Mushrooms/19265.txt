At this point I started having the really interesting delusion that the force of our experience was so powerful, that it was locking other people into our trip. I became convinced that the other three people in the house, Monkey, Cado and Marshian, were all experiencing the exact same thing as I was. I imagined them, shocked at first to find themselves tripping balls without having taken any drugs at all. I imagined them all lying down in silent darkness to witness our journey. I thought that the other trippers in the room with me were likewise experiencing the same thing as me, having the exact same revelations within themselves.
