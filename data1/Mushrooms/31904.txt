It was around 3pm by the time we decided to leave, and both me and my friend were tripping very heavily. Every feature and detail on the rocks beneath us were so evident, so beautiful. Each shimmer and reflection that bounced off of the water from the sun sparkled in harmony with the sea. As we got up to leave, we thanked the frenchman for his company- and walked back up the jetty to the sand. As we did so, I felt a deep connection with each rock as I stepped. The feeling of the cold, smooth and slightly rough surface against my feet brought me immense joy. Everything in nature was just so incredible. I thought about how beautiful these tiny mushrooms were and how grateful I truly was for the experience. I thought about how beautiful these tiny mushrooms were and how grateful I truly was for the experience. I felt a true connection with my friend as well. She looked so beautiful in the sunlight and I smiled and gave her a huge hug. I was nearly crying with joy, for I was filled with overwhelming love and truly was grateful for having such a close and special person in my life. Her eyes sparkled and she hugged me back as I knew she felt the same. We walked together arm in arm back to the station, it was only until I was able to view a wider range of objects that I realised that the visuals were becoming increasingly more intense. Each step I took felt numbed and floppy, I wasn't able to control my legs as easily as I had initially had- and pointing my finger straight proved to be an extremely difficult task. Even tying my shoelaces was almost impossible to do.
