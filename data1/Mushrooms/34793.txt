T+0:45 - sounds are different very much so now, small sounds I would never notice seem to jump out at me. This mall has a billion lights, neon lights, and all different kinds all around, I had known this ahead of time and knew I'd love it. I had no real visuals yet except that the lights had that aura kinda thing everyone talks about, its like a colorful light surrounding it, sort of like if you squint your eyes but more colorful.
