Anyway.  The ceiling looked really thick (it has that 'popcorn' style plaster, so it's bumpy rather than flat) and I saw a lot of stuff up there.   When I closed my eyes, I felt like the bed was moving in waves along with the ceiling, like I was floating on a raft on a calm ocean or lake.  I left myself slip into a trance and felt the body high and music, and let them become one with the visuals behind my eyes.  While Coldplay was on, I had my first real spiritual awakening.  I still don't know exactly how to describe it or what it was, so I can't really call it an epiphany or revelation just yet.  Just an 'experience'.  While my eyes were closed, I first saw patterns that beat the hell out of the visuals on windows media player.  Then, I started reliving fragments of dreams from not only the night before (which I had forgotten until then), but dreams from many different times in the past.  I told J I was seeing 'all the dreams I've ever had'.  While that was happening, I felt a presence hovering just above me.  I couldn't see her, or really 'talk' to her, but I could feel her and we could communicate without words or even by forming words in my thoughts, or hearing her say words in my head.  I did say a few things out loud, though, because J thought I was talking to him.  I opened my eyes and looked at him, and said to ignore me unless I talk directly to him, because I may be talking to myself, or 'someone else', for a while.  He said 'okay' and went back into his own head.
