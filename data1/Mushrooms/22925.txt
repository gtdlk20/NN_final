Although I've extended my sense of identity and learned to accept a small part of it (my appearance), there's still the problem that I am nebulously defined. I don't mean that in a philosophical sense, but in a very practical one. I am a different person to different people. I have almost no preferences and yet I don't like to be associated with the passivity that that implies. So I arbitrarily pick quirks and interests whenever I meet a new group of people. I redefine myself constantly, but it happens so gradually that very rarely do people notice. It's akin to my writing style throughout this whole piece. I've switched from present tense to past tense, my prose has varied from verbose to simplistically direct, and I may have even switched from third person to first a few times. My written voice is broken and disjointed, variegated as if shining through a broken mirror. I'm not defending it for it is plain and simple bad writing. But it makes sense considering my multi-faceted identity. I actually screamed in my head at one point, 'Who am I?'
