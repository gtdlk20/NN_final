I believe this trip taught me a lot.  It put me on a road to discovery and enlightenment.  One of the most tangible changes in me was to do with my scientific and logical outlook on life.  I found awe and wonder in the Universe, its great size and the amazing stellar events that take place within it (including the one that brought us into existence).  I was given the chance to look on Amsterdam, its variety of colours and the vibrant life there, with the eyes of a child.  I could see the wonder in all that was before me, particularly the Vondel Park and the busy tourist-filled neon lit streets.  I could be filled with awe by the smallest, and maybe even insignificant thing.  I truly understood for the first time that we really donÂ’t know anything and have since seen the world in a much less logical light.  For the fist time in my life I feel ready to embrace an idea that would be seen as religious.
