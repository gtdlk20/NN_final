I was always one to take such things very seriously. While others would consider it a party drug, I seemed to inherently understand that any trip was an opportunity to be fully explored. Perhaps it was due to my fondness of Carlos Castanada. I remember getting together 5 individuals, pre-treating them with a tricyclic antidepressant, then snorting a small amount of cocaine immediately before dropping to ensure the maximum effect. I can't explain the neurophysiology now, though due to the line of study I was in at the time, it was certainly a rationally well-thought out consideration.
