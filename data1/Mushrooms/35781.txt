I should mention at this point a few things about my sister's room, where we were planning to trip, it is amazing.  Over the course of a decade, each bit of every wall has been covered with art, collages, random quotes, posters, portraits, postcards, and paint.  You can trip simply by sitting there.  It is beautiful.  A living collaboration of greens, blues, oranges, purples, and a thousand colors in between.  People who have never been inside before spend the first five minutes just staring.  Then they start to think she is crazy.  But I know the truth, she is just plain cool.  I knew it was going to blow me away on shrooms.
