I was getting real answers to the questions I was asking, which I can't possibly confer in writing. I saw how absolutely everything that exists, must exist because of cause, effect, and balance. That the balance of good and evil, of pleasure and pain is what allows matter, life, human beings, consciousness, to evolve in a way that will gain us something great. Our true potential. I saw the purpose in everything I ever loved in the world, and that purpose was to delight me and to subtly remind me that I was god so that I would reassume my powers.
