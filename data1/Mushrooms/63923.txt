I can smoke in my room at night because my mom's room is on the top level of the house so I had made sure to have some weed for the trip. I ate the whole eighth except for a few caps at around 9:00 PM after I got home from rehab. After I ate them I just sat at my computer talking to people waiting for them to kick in.
