Shrooms usually take about 30-45 minutes to kick it, and when they do the body high comes in. Everything is funny, you feel light, giddy, humorous, extreme energy, happyness, etc.  However, this time because I smoked weed, this stage was bypassed completely.  After 30 minutes me and my friends walked to the park near our house.  As we hiked down to this spot we had previously decided to trip at, I noticed my vision getting very starry, blinking lights were everywhere.  We got to the spot and sat down, all of a sudden I could not understand a work my friends were saying.  It sounded like I was hearing the english language for the first time.  I looked at the scenery in front of me but I couldnt even comprehend what it was.  Everything had turned chrome, even the trees,  Everything was extremely bright and I could barely focus on anything.  The hill in the distance had turned into a dinosaur shape, the sky was completely silver, the foilage all around me was completely chrome and silver.  Objects such as my cigerrete butt had taken on life.  THe cigerette wrapper was having sex with the cigerette filter.  THe smoke coming off my friends cigerettes looked like jet fighters.  This is the intense hallucination stage one might experiance from shrooms.  It will probably last about an hour or so, then the hallucinations and trip will begin to wear down.
