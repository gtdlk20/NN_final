The real hallucinating started in his room after sitting in three rounds of large bongs. Just as weed enhances the hallucinations if you are on ecstacy, the same and even worse I think happens with mushrooms. Also I clearly remember Tim rolling bloody nice joint and wondering how the hell he could do that in his state. I was seeing geometrical patterns of different colours. The strange thing though was that these patterns were morphing from one thing into another depending on what environment I was in. The shapes would change size and position and colour. If I went outside the setting that before was euphoric now seemed dark and depressing, the shapes would morph into something that represented evil, due to the dark setting. A sort of Picasso cubist style, horned beast was in front of me, laughing the most terrible laugh ever, then that would change into lots of smaller ones in a lattice formation within my imagination, still constantly laughing. This shit was freaking me out and I was getting scared, I definitely had to get back inside.
