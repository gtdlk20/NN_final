One thing I noticed about mushrooms is that they make me become very introspective and philosophical. I came to so many deep, philosophical conclusions about life and the unierse on mushrooms! I basically had an existentialist epitome: mushrooms really helped me realize that life is essentially pointless, that there is no God, and that it's my duty to rebel against this pointlessness, to create my own purpose in life. Basically everything Albert Camus wrote in the Myth of Sisyphus, I realized while tripping on shrooms.
