The first noticable aspect of the trip was the fact that time was irrelevent.  I would glance at the clock and it would say 3:00 and then it would feel like hours and I would glance back at the clock and it would say 3:01.  J was playing 'Vice City' with P while all this was happening.  I felt the desire to describe what was happening but I felt that talking was not necessary.  So I stared quietly at the city while listening to Metallica on the radio.  Suddenly I started having intense vivid open eyed visuals.  I was really ready for it, at first I was just staring up at the white ceiling and brown ceiling fan when all of a sudden white lace seemed to by strung all over the ceiling.  As I looked closer I could see the patterns were very intricate.  They seemed to be blowing around in a gust of wind, but the window was closed so I moved my hand up to pull some down so I could study the patterns more.  Then the fan morphed into a brilliant eagle.  Wow these shrooms were good.
