My computer desktop had a picture of me and my friend lying on the ground. We looked like corpses and I couldn't bear to look at it. I went to find my cell phone for someone to talk to, but the moment I picked it up I didn't know how to use it or who to call. I forgot what I was doing, all I could do was look at the clock in pain at how slow it would take for one minute to pass. My mind took over and I began to believe that time was stopping. The room around me became dark and overwhelmingly evil. Everywhere I looked there was nothing to turn to for comfort and it seemed as if all of my possessions were turning on me and reminding me of how bad of a person I am. I was still a teenager during this and I called for my mother half heartedly, not knowing if she would  be there or if she could hear me. She entered the room looking like a monster. It was at that point I was convinced the world had ended. She asked me what was wrong with me and I told her I was in Hell. She called my sister into the room when I curled up and began crying hysterically on the ground. My sister came in not understanding and my mother explained that I was having a bad trip. She knelt beside me and in her most comforting voice, tried to explain to me that it was only a drug and I was perfectly fine.
