At one point I went to the bathroom.  Or rather, I swam.   The carpet in the hallway was glowing and the door frames were still flowing and moving.  The floor was very hilly, and unfortunately those hills were moving around so I almost stumbled a few times, trying to avoid them.  The act of going to the bathroom was more or less normal, as was washing my hands and drying them off; except for the fact that the towel was wonderfully squishy.
