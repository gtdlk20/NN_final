As we got to the station to get on I was tripping pretty hard. The entire ride was amazing. I have ridden it many times in the past but it was never this good. The ride seemed to set off my trip because as soon as we got off I was peaking. At the end of the ride we looked at our pictures on monitors. When I saw mine our heads were moving and the entire wall of monitors were shifting.
