A scene approaches, two of the children are older.  A boy and a girl, trying desperately to live through the winter.  The girl is pregnant.  The boy works for farmers to be able to stay warm through the winter in their barn. They have their child.  They teach him as they were taught, simply to love each other, and treat each other with kindness, as though every person was part of their own family. They use the mushrooms to gain enlightenment on a regular basis.  The child becomes very wise, learning how to portray his knowledge to others in a way they can understand. The church does not approve of his following.  They kill him publicly. His teachings are so effective that his story is told for thousands of years.
