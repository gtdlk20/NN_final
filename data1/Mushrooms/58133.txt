The first time I ate mushrooms, my sister and I were young, inexperienced highschoolers with a drug background of little more than marijuana, tobacco, and coffee.  We had recently fallen in with a group of slightly older surfer-types who boasted a much more intimate familiarity with the variety of intoxicants out there in this world.  These guys entrusted us with an ounce of mushrooms before a weekend beach party or something, and gave us the go-ahead to experiment a bit beforehand, with no cautionary comments or the like.
