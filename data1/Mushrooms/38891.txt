I never really started buying weed until the end of tenth grade or so, and my tastes in marijuana became refined,not like Ed Rosenthal or some real hippie dude, but I knew my Schwags from Kind bud or Dank Nugs. Towards the end of senior year, my friend Scott had also started getting stoned a lot and we had a 'clique' of six or seven guys who hung out a lot and smoked all night and on the weekends. Scott is a cool guy, very well read and articulate, but also not afraid to try different things. He can be a real a**-hole on his bad days, but your best friend in the world on a good day. One day Scott was acting pretty kind and asked me to chill out, we would get ripped, go eat something, call some girls, etc. I said sure, I wasn't working that day, and we got into his car after school. We talked for a little while, and suddenly he asks me if I'd want to split an eighth of shrooms with him and spend the night at his house. I was like 'OK, let me try these magic mushrooms, and let's see what all the hype is about'. No amount of getting high from top quality marijuana could prepare me for that night.
