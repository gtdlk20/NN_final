1) Take a half pint Ball or Kerr jar and make a hole just large enough to stick the needle in toward the edge of the lid.  You should make this in the same place you would an inoculation hole when using PF Tek, except punch through from the TOP to the bottom of the lid rather than the bottom up.  This makes it so the tape in step 4 will seal properly.
