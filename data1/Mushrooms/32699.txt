So I sat on my bed and lit the insence, and turned the Tv off. The scent was immaculate. And the smoke kept turning into mushrooms. I stuck the end of the incense stick (not the end that was burning, duh) in my mouth and started waving it around with my jaw. It was as if I was conducting some kind of shroom-smoke symphany. After a bit, I started to think about things. I started to get very sad. But I knew I was not going to have a bad trip. Which I didn't.
