We got back to my house where the experience was to take place; at about 9:30 we started munching, I ate 3/4 of my bag compared to the 1/2 my friends ate, and we settled back to await the trip.  My friends were playing chess while I watched; we talked quite a bit about how green is a good color for trips, and the lights seemed to bright so we killed them, we were all feeling extremely giggly and happy at this point.  My visuals kicked in after about 30 minutes; I was beginning to see objects growing larger out of the corner of my eye, soon I noticed that a wall was very clearly breathing and announced that I was starting to go, my friends didn't have any visuals for about another 15 minutes so I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.
