The next morning, after my buddy left, I cleaned up a little bit and called up my parents. They were well, and were having a good time at my Uncle's house, and wished me a happy new year. Usually, after a crazy trip, I appreciate reality and want to just get back to my everyday regular life. I sort of missed having my family at home, and I was alone all day. I finally ate something and took a nap until about 6pm, and now I am writing this. Very memorable experience, and an interesting way to start off the new year. A+ trip.
