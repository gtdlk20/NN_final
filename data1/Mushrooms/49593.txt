After about 3 hours after the second batch the far off distant feeling of not being real subsided and we were left with constant visuals of breathing walls and melting doors. Another thing that amazed me was the very bad time lapse, one minute seems as if it was 2 hours, I watched in amazement at the second hand on my watch move at a turtle's pace or wouldn't move at all then end up on the 7. We started this journey at about 8 pm and finally began to mellow out and start to lay down and try and sleep at around 5am. I have done Mushrooms and LSD before but this mushroom trip was by far more intense but not as long at an LSD trip sadly, but definitely well worth the two hours spent picking in the field.
