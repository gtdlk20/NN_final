S points out a chandelier to me. The fixture is large and seems to be at some completely different angle, as if gravity is pulling at some odd angle. It resembles the shape of a human heart, and I see if pulsing and beating like a heart. I still feel nervous about the lights being on, because I canÂ’t take off my glasses, and cant decide which is more conspicuous, huge pupils or wearing sunglasses.
