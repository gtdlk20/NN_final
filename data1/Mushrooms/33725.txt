3:45 - Sitting down on a park bench outside the museum. I close my eyes and see an enthralling and fascinating world of morphing shapes and colors. Circles, ovals, and patterns are constantly appearing and changing shape. Though the show on the inside of my eyelids is enticing, my stomach feels mildly upset and the nausea is hindering my enjoyment of the trip. I try to tell myself that everything is OK, but the feeling persists. The upset stomach while coming up was the only real road bump during the entire trip.
