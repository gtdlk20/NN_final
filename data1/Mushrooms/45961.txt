3:30 PM - Me and my friend eat the dried 0.75g of shrooms (Psilocybin Cubensis) we were saving for today. I feel like the Clonazolam is going to work really well in comparison to the Nifoxipam I tried a couple of months ago (Nixofipam's not bad, but this Clonazolam has a little mood-lift of it's own too). We walk up to our local forest which we know how to navigate round very well, and within 20 minutes the shrooms start to work.
