I journeyed to several places in my mind (too many to list). Books that I read, childhood memories, fantasies, they were all rushing through my head, but I was not simply a passive observer, I encompassed everything that was happening, I was a part of everything. I could control everything, but I could also set up a scenario and let it play out, with no knowledge of what was to happen. I was an ultimate being of knowledge and understanding. And I was not alone. I felt another consciousness out there, calling to me. We were as two strings wishing to be entwined. I yearned to be joined with this consciousness. I thought then that I'd gotten trapped in this mortal world and that the other consciousness had set up the scenario for me to eat the mushrooms so that I could be 'called back' to the outside world. I felt as though I could just slip out of the mortal world, back to where I belonged, so I could be with this other consciousness. But I was afraid. I regained a little bit of rational thinking and was afraid that if I 'stepped over' I would really send my self into a coma or something and that this was all in my head. But it was all still real enough for me to ponder the question for a long while. I also at this point had no idea how my mind would be able to revert back to normal, after being enlightened as it had. How would I be able to comprehend the world as it was if I chose to stay here? I decided to stay in this world and see what would happen. Minutes after I made this decision the movie ended, the lights came on and I was back in reality. The sudden and complete transition was shocking in its lack of effect. Although a bit disoriented, my mind was nicely back in reality.
