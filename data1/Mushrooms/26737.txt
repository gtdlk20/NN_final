My alien feelings did not make me think that I was born on another planet, in another part of this universe, I felt like my true nature was not material, but spiritual, that I was of this world, in that I was this world, and I was a manifestation of the divine in us all. The entheogenesis of the cubensis mushroom allowed me to become the mushroom itself and the deity it represents - which is the universe. Here lay all the answers - somewhere in my brain, but unreachable, for to understand the divine in my material state is the end of the material state. We cannot fathom the true nature of reality like this, in the day to day state, or explain it in words. Words are not enough, I learned on that April night.
