My friend decides to go to bed, it's now like 5:30am, and I'm tired, but not quite ready to sleep. I head upstairs to my bedroom and can't figure out what to do. Whenever I do any drugs really I end up having a tough problem deciding between things. So I bring up pictures from when I was in Ireland. I quickly realize I can manipulate the pictures to do basically anything I want. For example, the castle I stayed in, I brought that picture up, I could make all the trees waves, the water in the fountain move, and people walk around and cars drive away. It was incredible. I finally decide it's time to go to bed, and quickly fall asleep. I awake the next morning after only a max of 5 hours of sleep, feeling fine, refreshed, and sobor.
