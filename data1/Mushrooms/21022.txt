My own consciousness lit up --- manifested -- created --- a loosely defined part of the fractal, like a candle whose light fades imperceptibly into the distance. I had a vague centre, but no edges. I had a sense that the space was infinite, that I was experiencing only one perspective on one bit of an infinite fractal universe. It was the same universe as waking life, perceiving it as a dancing fractal rainbow was simply a different perspective from waking life. I remember noticing a paradox, my perspective being the only one that was real in that moment, and that moment containing an awareness that all other moments and perspectives were also real. Other consciousness was both less real and no less real than my own. I was also aware of consciousness as the living, growing, healing, learning edge of the pattern.
