So we left and by the time we arrived, we were both tripping pretty hard. Her dog was with us, and we skipped around with him, marveling at the beauty of the trees, mountains, grass, bark, sky, everything. I believe there are some photos of me with my friend, a large cottonwood tree. We were having a wonderful time and had just about peaked at this point, when 4 or 5 middle aged strangers came off of one of the trails, also with dogs. My friend's dog was desperate to play with the other dogs and the people, being friendly, engaged us in conversation about what type of dog he was, etc. It was aweful. She was laughing hysterically and looking at the ground while I tried to hold the conversation together without the strangers thinking we were tripping. After about 15 minutes we dragged her dog away from their dogs, made excuses and ran frantically back to my car.
