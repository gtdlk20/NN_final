With that disclaimer, I did and still do see psychedelic therapy as a relevant piece of the mental health puzzle. For some, perhaps a small piece, for others a larger piece, but a relevant piece to consider either way. This means I believe psychedelic therapy alone is unlikely to work if not accompanied by other puzzle pieces.
