T+1:30 - Auditory is very hard to explain but hasn't changed much since last time, no actual hallucinations like hearing things that aren't there, just the sounds that I do hear are very much changed. Visuals are really getting amazing now. Me and S went to eat something at burger king, he got this bright green florescent soda from somewhere else, and I didn't want him to drink it for the sake of me looking at it, I got my own after he drank it to carry around. It glowed the brightest green I've ever seen and probably ever will see(since then I've got another and noticed it was not very bright at all, just very lime green).
