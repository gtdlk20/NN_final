I had tripped shrooms on a number of occasions, somewhere around twenty times I believe, but had never gone any higher than 1/8. Psychedelics have always teased me in one way or another; I always feel as though IÂ’m on the edge of having a genuine psychedelic experience that is utterly life-changing and lives up to what people like Timothy Leary would describe it as, but instead only gain interesting perspective and insight. Not that that is a bad thing, but I always strive for more. So you can imagine my delight when I heard that my friend was bringing some shrooms into town (a nice surprise considering this town never gets good drugs). I had money, and decided that despite how intense it was bound to be (I personally think that shrooms are more intense than LSD), I was going to eat a whole 7 grams. We planned to leave the house we stayed in and go to a trail near campus to experience the trip in nature. My opinion is that if the earth is kind enough to give us a fruit as important as psychedelic mushrooms, we should honor it by experiencing the spirit of the earth while we trip.
