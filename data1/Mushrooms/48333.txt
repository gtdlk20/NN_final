When I got up, it all came as a rush.  I started seeing patterns in everything, and I felt strange, but not like a 'high.'  Anyways, the anxiety all started when I couldn't stop thoughts from rushing through my head, and I felt like I couldn't control a single thought, like the floodgates were open and there was nothing I could do.  The problem with this free thought was the fact that for some reason I couldn't cull, from the rushing multitude of thoughts, the directions back to camp.  I knew that they were in my mind, but when I tried to stop and think of the specific way, it seemed like the thought would just get washed away as soon as I thought I had anchored it, when I went searching for the succeeding part of my journey.  So I started walking.
