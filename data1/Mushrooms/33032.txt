I wanted to watch some TV. When I went to sit down, I felt like I was sitting on a water bed, it was like a slideshow, every slide as I went from the standing position to sitting was uniquely remembered like the memory was always there, but also was happening in a way.. as weird as that may sound. I turned on the TV and watched South Park. I remember loving the show but for some reason it was much different, their heads were really big and they were talking extremely fast, faster than I could comprehend, it almost seemed as though in a different language, or maybe English backwards. It actually made me laugh, as did almost everything else.
