The group in the middle are so joyous, they are the ones who are considered my close friends. They sound different when they speak, instead of the Snoopy parental drone, they make the sound of a flip tab of a soda can hitting the ground or a small coin hitting cement. It always reminds me of laughter. They always seem joyous when they speak and they make me smile through my tears every time.
