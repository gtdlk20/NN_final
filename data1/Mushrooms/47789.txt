After about 30 minutes I started seeing little spots and interlocking red and black banded rings. They would appear for a while, then disappear. I kept saying 'Guys, here they come... they're coming.' A while later I start seeing them more consistantly, and am starting to yawn quite frequently. We smoked a few more gravity bongs, and then I realized it. I still had a 5 mile walk ahead of me to drop off B's weed, and  by now it's getting dark. I tried to talk someone in to coming with me so I wouldn't get lost or hit by a car or something. One guy was almost persuaded (I told him B would let him blaze if he came), but decided not to seeing as how it was such a far walk.
