About another half hour passed and I was feeling a bit uneasy, so I switched over to my computer to play some Nintendo 64 and to listen to music. I had also turned off the lights, so the only light in my room was the blueish glow given off by my computer monitors. I turned on Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, probably one of the trippiest games of all time. Very fitting and pairs well with psilocybin as well as LSD. I also threw together a Boards of Canada playlist. Again, great music to listen to during a trip.
