This was my second time trying shrooms. we chopped up the shrooms and made tea (mint tea, it was very good). the effects came on pretty quick, within 10 mins. we had the lights off, other than a tower with two black and one blue light. we had some Omm, DJ Shadow, and Infected Mushrooms playing (great music for trips by the way). I have trouble getting visuals so i closed my eyes. As a smooth womans voice sang on in the music I saw a beautiful naked woman spiraling upward in the middle of a DNA strand. As she kept spiraling, she slowly turned into my ex-girlfriend, which really freaked me out! My current girlfriend was sitting next to me and in my mind, I thought she knew what I was watching, I thought she was going to be pissed.
