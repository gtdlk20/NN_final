Was playing Magic: The Gathering when I felt it hitting. Had to throw in the towel as the high got stronger. My friend put on Pink Floyd's The Wall for me to watch, but I ended up watching the ceiling above the TV, which was swirling and pulsing, much more interesting than the movie which I couldn't make any sense of.
