I have always been impressed by the way mushroom takes possession of the entire body (not only the brain as with MJ) even on low doses. This time was no exception. The onset was very quick and 30 min. after ingestion, my limbs were very heavy and I was walking like a drunk man. Where ever I gazed, the swirling, moving effect around my line of sight was present. The place I had decided to retreat to is a quiet, isolated spot in a mountain nearby. I was afraid not being able to make it. But I concentrated my attention on that goal and in 15 min. of erratic walking, there I was.
