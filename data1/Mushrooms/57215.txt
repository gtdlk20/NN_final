I started to meditate and try to equilibrate my energies as I prayed to the gods and spiritual friends to guide me during this experience, during this time I was in my bedroom, with only a notebook screen playing some chakra healing music. This lasted only 10 minutes as my wife disturbed me when a few people arived at my house (her mother, and her cousin's wife). I didn't go out to see them as I knew I was coming up and I was already feeling the effects. My body was starting to feel heavy, I was yawning every two minutes and felt really sleepy, my heart was starting to race a little bit. My body was starting to feel heavy, I was yawning every two minutes and felt really sleepy, my heart was starting to race a little bit. So I laid down, held my notebook and started to listen to different kinds of music to calm me down and ground me throughout this comeup.
