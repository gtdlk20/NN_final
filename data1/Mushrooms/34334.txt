23:00: Im already far away and I just cant help myself looking at the ceiling, from which thousands of eyes come down and surround me. Millions of ideas come in my mind, I feel repulsion to all the fake thing we usually do like smiling when we dont feel to, hating other people, and in all the material needs. Its like the eyes are coming from God cause all I could see in them was purity, honesty and love.
