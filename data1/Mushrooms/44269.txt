There were four of us.  Jake, a chronic pothead who was always up for a good time.  Kevin, another chronic who loved to party as much as Jake, myself, a quasi-responsible student who liked to experiment, and Tom, a guy who kind of just joined us in the mix, not really a part of our group, but not really outside of it either.
