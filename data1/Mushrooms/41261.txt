When I got into my neighborhood I was totally lost. Nothing seemed normal and it felt like it was my first time there. After bad tripping for a few hours, I decided I was going to take a bath and go to sleep, I felt exhausted. So as I'm taking a shower and listening to music, I started to feel great. I felt so pure and clean. I was enjoying life. It felt as if I had died earlier and then I was reborn. I got out of the shower fully energized and pumped. I felt like life was beautiful. Everything felt great and I felt like nothing can go wrong. I would at the sky and flowers and see the beauty in them.
