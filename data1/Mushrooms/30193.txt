If you think of your mind in two parts, the part that controls yourself in the real world, and your unconscious. I believe that I, the normal controller of my physical body was plunged into the world of my unconscious and the physical body was controlled by the unconscious and was able to function in a minimal fashion. Later talks with my bowling team mates said I bowled normally, but didn't talk to any of them expect for random illegible comments throughout the night.
