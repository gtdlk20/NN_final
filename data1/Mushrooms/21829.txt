'Did you see any spirits?' I asked J, since he was actually seeing things and I had just gotten mental visions. J shrugged and said, 'maybe. One.' I was fascinated. 'What was it like?' J shrugged again. 'Big, like really big. Uhm, female.' He was highly skepticalâ€‹ and uneasy talking about anything that might be categorized as 'woo.' I pressed, but he wouldn't say anymore about it. This must've been what he was seeing and talking to when he'd drifted off to sleep earlier. Heh-heh, a giant woman perhaps? I wanted to know more.
