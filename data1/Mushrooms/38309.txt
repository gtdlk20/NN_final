One night, late in spring, I sat in my yard staring off into space in deep thought. I was thinking about the nature of the way people view things. We all have eyes evolutionarily designed to see whats in front of us. We can look straight into sky and see the moon, the sun, and the stars. We can stare into the horizon and see buildings that reach to the clouds, and look around us and see thousands of people rushing around in their cars. We can see everything happening around us, and to us. I realized that we could see nearly anything with our eyes except ourselves. We have no way of seeing ourselves or the things we do without using predisposition. We each have an ego, or an already set self image of ourselves that that we live by. This can very easily cloud ones self-judgment.
