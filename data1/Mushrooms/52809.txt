Apply the casing layer to the spawn, and keep watered. When the mycelia has permeated the casing layer, drop the temperature about 10 degrees to induce fruiting. When picking, use a razor blade or other sharp implement to cut the fruit close to the soil.  Make sure you don't damage any of the pinheads which will eventually grow to full size.  You should get two or three flushes of mushrooms over the next couple of weeks. When no more caps fruit, toss the contents outside in a shady area and wait for next year.  You might also want to make some spore prints of your own. To do this, cut off a mature cap and place on a piece of paper.  Cover the cap with a glass or cup and let sit for a couple of hours.
