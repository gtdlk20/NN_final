Conclusion: Fucking awesome. That's how I sum up this experience, I can definitely see myself abusing mushrooms, I'm going to limit myself to 2-3 trips a year, just because. I don't really know why. I don't seem to get any after-affects, but they could really fuck up my brain at the age I am. (17 in three weeks! Definitely dropping acid on mah b'day!) But if mushrooms had been well researched professionally and I had conclusive evidence that habitual use wouldn't cause neurological damage I would eat mushrooms every single fucking afternoon, every afternoon. My day would be work/school/socialize for the morning and midday periods, mushrooms for afternoon to night and then sleep. Really. I really would. I <3 Mushrooms.
