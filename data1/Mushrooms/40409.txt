For instance, I was lying on my bed naked, and to get up and go into the house naked would have been nothing to me. It would have just one arrangement of pixellated objects, though I'm sure that doesn't make sense to anyone but me. Everything I sensed seemed only to be an object floating around in 3d space, whether it was a feeling, or a sound, or spacial orientation. So, there was the still small voice of reason telling me that this particular arrangement would be negatively significant, and that I would not be doing myself any favors to arrange them that way.
