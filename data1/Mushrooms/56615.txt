 After that I went upstairs and S and I hung out for awhile. I was still tripping really hard but it was mostly just a happy joyous feeling. We smoked some more bud so weÂ’d feel better but it just made us trip out again. I laid in bed and commenced to make strange howling noises in the middle of which we broke out in more extreme laughter. We felt great at the time and got on the computer and smoked some more bud. The next two hours or so just consisted of us talking about what just happened and finishing off our weed, which by the time we finished it was making me trip rather hard again. S laid down and eventually fell asleep, while I attempted to play some Skyrim. The bud proved too much for me though and I promptly passed out while sitting in the chair, later awakened by my grandma. I climbed into bed and felt amazing as the breeze from my open windows swept across me.
