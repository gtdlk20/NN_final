She knows I dont mean anything by this, making it seem like she was the thundercloud that temporarily burst my hallucinogenic bubble. It would have been the same if anyone I am close to didnt feel good. Its like you take on their sadness and it gets magnified. Because mushrooms strip all the shit away and you look at what is truly there, I was telling her my wall visions, which probably didnt help her mood any. Lol.
