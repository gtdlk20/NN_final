11:30 - The colors are coming back and our friends have come back in from the snow.  They went to take showers to warm up and leave us alone in the room again.  I felt all my inhibitions and worries about the petty things in life had totally disappeared.  I had to get my girlfriend out of her wet clothes and I was soon naked too.  I felt that being naked was the right thing to do and that modesty had no bearing.  I felt the world was a beautiful place and I couldnÂ’t care if anyone saw me naked because I so loved the world.  The touch of skin against skin was incredible.  I could kiss my girlfriend's stomach and feel my face enveloped in warmth and merge with her body.  Sex the third time finally worked right.  The only problem was every time I closed my eyes; I was transported to a different room within my mind.  I was in smooth rooms of round shapes with rainbows and colors running and spinning all over the walls.  Some rooms were just a wall in front of me that looked like a tapestry or oriental rug.  I then came into the temple of spiraling triangles that was one of the most beautiful visuals.  There were numerous rows of triangles with spiraling colorful swirls in them that moved back and forth in a sea of color.  The colors rose to a point of light at the top of the temple.  I had to keep my eyes open and watch us if we were to have sex.  Orgasms had become mental and I had already had several of them during the night that felt way beyond what a physical orgasm could be.  The sexual experience itself was incredible and extremely beautiful.  The union of two people into one was amazing.  Physical orgasm manifested itself as the temple of the half moon.  I was suddenly in another temple populated by green half moon shapes.  They were the color of sugar snaps and each one had eyes in the center of it.  They all blinked and disappeared as all my energy disappeared with it.
