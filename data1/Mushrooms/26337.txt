10:22pm - Totally amazed, she and I just lay there for a few more minutes talking about the experience we just had.  She had absolutely been there with me and experienced the same things.  We had a mutual trip!  I continued to look at her face and she said she could see her face in mine and I saw her face mold itself into mine and realized that we were the same person.  The color in her right cheek turned into a rising sun painted on her cheek and I saw all my heritage of native americans in her face.  I saw their painted cheeks and their pain and suffering of years flash across this beautiful face.  I then saw a rainbow pull out of her right eye and I felt myself return to my childhood and was a child again.  I thought the rainbow was very indicative of the old Care Bears tv show and I felt right at home in this rainbow as a child.  I mentioned what happened and she was stunned to say she had seen it and gone with me.  We tried to discuss the connection we felt.  I saw the tube of energy connecting us at the base of our stomachs and when we were close, it surrounded our entire bodies like a spider web.  We laid together rippling and turning into waves for a few more minutes and realizing that every kiss felt like our first ever.  We tried to have sex to internalize the emotions we just felt but the experience kept jumping around and it was too hard for either of us to focus on one thing.  She got up to go to the bathroom and I followed.
