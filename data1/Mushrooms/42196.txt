One summer evening, my boyfriend and I ingested some remarkable mushrooms.  We were camping around several people, some that we knew, and some that we didn't.  This was neither one of our first times, so we knew what to expect.  This experience turned out to be both my most fun, best mushroom trip and one of the least fun.
