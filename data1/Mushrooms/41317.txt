Me and a friend (I will refer to him as R) both took our shrooms in the afternoon while camping on the river.  Although I dont remember exactly how much was in the bar of chocolate I think it was between 1/4 and 1/3 an ounce.  R was drinking alcohol.  I was not.  We were both smoking lots of cannabis.  Our girlfriends didnt take any shrooms.
