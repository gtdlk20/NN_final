As one friend began to say something about me becoming some sort of great person I heard all the voices very clearly proclaim that I was a visionary leader; I wanted to have a band that I played guitar and sang in, one of my friends was my fellow guitarist who I always thought of as a visionary in his own way, suddenly I was being told that I was in fact the leader and that the people would follow me when they realized what I was, it gave a very hopeful life altering message to me that was an incredibly emotional experience.
