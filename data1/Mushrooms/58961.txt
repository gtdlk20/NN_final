As we started to put the puzzle together, I remembered that last thanksgiving a year ago, a goat had been slaughtered by some type of animal.  I told my friends and they also became scared and remembered.  We still don't know what it was, knowing that every Thanksgiving that creature must come back for something.  So that was one trip that was quite amazing, I can't wait to do it once more.
