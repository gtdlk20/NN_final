Anyway, back inside, and I reeally feel time slowin to a craawl, and eventually felt like I was trapped in time (this has never happened to me to that extent, so I was kinda scared at the time, but I'm sure that it's a normal thing that happens). The cool jagged snakey pattern things were pretty much takin over my whole field of vision and it made it hard to see, and when I closed my eyes it was nothing but totally different undescribable spinning patterns... So after a while of everyone actin kinda crazy the way shrooms make ya do, I got tired and laid down to try and sleep (which I shouldn't have done, come on I'm on shrooms and it's new years fuck), but sleep was impossible anyway.
