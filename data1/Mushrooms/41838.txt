I don't know what happened to me. I just stopped myself and told myself it was just my mind, none of it was true. I told myself to get up, and enjoy the rest of the night. I told myself not to worry, if anything happened my friends were here, and that nothing WOULD happen. I snapped myself out of it. Looking back, I find it quite amazing how fast I was able to snap myself out. The whole bad experience lasted only about an hour.
