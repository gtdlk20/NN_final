Doing mushrooms was something that I had considered, though never actively pursued. Of course, a friend of a friend managed to get some, inquired as to whether or not I was interested, and in fact, I was. Its late April, so the sun goes down around 8ish where I live. It had been a rather dreary day, mostly overcast, but still reasonably warm (mid 70's). I didn't eat anything for about six hours, and around 5 I ingested the mushrooms, stems and caps.
