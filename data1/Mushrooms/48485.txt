On the last day of September, 2006, a group of friends and I gathered at about 6:00 with the intention to eat mushrooms together. We had recently been notified by a local dealer that there were good shrooms available, and that we could buy up to an ounce. We ended up purchasing a total of almost ½ of an ounce, I believe, split between four of us, to varying amounts. I ate about 1/6 of an ounce, my fellow psychonaut, who we will call Rhino, ate approximately the same. Two others, who well call Pangborn and Goofy, ate about 1/15th each. The measurements were not conducted on a scale, so exact amounts of mushrooms consumed are not available. Needless, to say, we has all taken high doses, considering it was a first true trip for most of us.
