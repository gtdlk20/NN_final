Truly beautiful. I remember coming up, after the anxiousness but before the peak, maybe 35-45 minutes after taking the first of them, things started to get wacky. I would simply focus in on the ground, and the pattern that is inherently in it popped out. They then started to creep towards me. The amazing thing was the more I would focus and comprehend what was happening, the clearer it would be. This was all in front of my sink. A little later, right before K and some people came in that I didn't know too well, I looked over to the floor in front of my computer, and it was almost 3 dimensional. At certain points it was, and it was moving, and I know if I would have stared longer as my hallucination got stronger, it would have been full blown.
