For about a year (now in my new university) I kept trying to meditate only to make extremely small advances. I never really got back to where I was before. This was a huge bummer, but the fact that I was doing better at school (purely because of interest in the field and having more discipline, and definitely not because of my ability to pay attention), and was having better luck with the ladies (usually because I could talk to them about classes we were taking together), I was feeling overall a hell of a lot better than I had been in my last university. My anxiety after the ecstacy and the not being able to meditate fortunately did not come back with a vengeance. I did get a little anxious and paranoid when I smoked too much in uncomfortable situations, but not nearly as much as a couple years back. Anyway, as I had said, in almost all aspects, my mindset was very healthy for a little mushroom trip.
