I've read some Castaneda on Don Juan before, but never focused much on it.  But after the trip reading excerpts from "The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge" about the 4 natural enemies of a man of knowledge really fit this narrative. (I will point them out in my trip and how they pertain to the growth of knowledge).  It also reminds me of the idea of narratives/stories being a way for the psyche to create a framework for experiencing reality, and how important that they are objective as possible, where knowledge is critical for growth.
