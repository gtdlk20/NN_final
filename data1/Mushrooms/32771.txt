I went out of the kitchen and poured the orange juice all over my face? Why? I was drenched and went in to show Neil what I had done but when I told him he informed me that I wasnt wet and the orange juice wasnt even open. thats right. I was seriously fucked up. As I played this back in my mind I became convinced that I must be hopping between alternative dimensions. The fact that Neils face kept turning into my dead granddads wasnt helping me to rationalise the situation.
