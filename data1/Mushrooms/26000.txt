Soon after I took refuge on the seat I became intensely aware of my body and every muscle in it. I remembered reading about this effect from Shrooms and how it might be uncomfortable for some people. It was. My jaw muscles were the worst, they seemed to be constantly tense and aching, and whenever I moved my jaw to try to relax the muscles other jaw muscles would feel tense and painful. As I focused more and more on this problem it became worse, my jaw muscles really began to hurt, and I couldnt get comfortable because I began to feel other muscles in my body tense up and ache. Any part of my body in contact with the seat was uncomfortable and I constantly moved about to try and relax, but it was impossible. I think that it was mostly in my mind, because at some point I just forgot about it and it didnt bother me again, although while it lasted it was very uncomfortable.
