I closed my eyes and began to pray. With my eyes closed, the hallucinations became more intense. I saw the shadow with flames for eyes that had made its presence known to me earlier.  Fuck you, I said to the demon. It was just the malevolent being and I, surrounded by red haze.  A black whirlpool formed beneath the demons eyes, where one would guess its mouth to be. Previously just a small walking faceless shadow, the demon began to change. It grew hundreds of times its previous size. It towered over me. It bent down, opened its swirling mouth and let out a fearsome earpiercing wail, exposing thousands off razor sharp jagged teeth that moved about like the blades of a chainsaw. Foul centipede like creatures danced on its forked scaly toung.  At that moment I thought I was surely dead. I repented. I begged for the divine spirit to save me. I visualized once again the silver pentagram emerged in white flames. As the beast was exposed to the sacred star, it shrunk back to a little critter and disappeared into the reddish mist. The mist cleared and I was surrounded by white light. A magnificent apparition of a bearded man with long hair appeared before me and smiled. I thought it may have been Jesus. When I thought that, he entered me.
