The walls were too trippy for me, I felt like I needed a break from them. I turned off the light and got into bed. I put on my favourite piano piece: Comtine d'Un Autre Ete and listened in the darkness. For the first time I closed my eyes and was almost instantly seeing a beautiful coloured visualiser in time to the music. My dopamine levels must have soared at that moment because suddenly I was in an intense emotional ecstacy. When the music faded I was in a kind of serene calm that I had never known. My duvet felt as if were made of warm, dry cloud and I was just starting to warm up which felt indescribably amazing. I was wearing my big brown hoodie that I got from WOMAD and was made in Nepal. It always made me feel like a snug, wise Cappucian. All I could hear was the waves now and a slow soft vibrating thrum like hum. I felt energy in my body. Coursing up and down giving me shivers of pleasure. It was strange, I was conscious at the time that the energy wasn't sexual although it felt fucking amazing. Like an entire body orgasm. But not in a sexual way? I don't know. Wrap your head around that. I wasn't given an instruction guide on how to be human, I just kinda take it as it comes.
