This moves me into thoughts of how human interaction is so limited. We are forced to use language as a way to express ourselves to each other, and this itself is a limited thing. We cannot show those around us what goes on in hour heads 24/7, we can never truly understand each other. Yet somehow, we are in the end all the same, and are all human. We come from the same place. Humans come from other humans who come from humans before them, and in the end we all end up connected by that one couple. No matter white, black, Asian, we come from the same two people somewhere, some when.
