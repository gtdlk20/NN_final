Instead of thinking to get there, I just walked where I felt I was supposed to go.  This is one of the strongest effects mushrooms have on me, is the buddhist concept of mindfulness, the ability to remain in the moment, right where you are, not looking down the road or thinking back.  At that moment I could have argued that I needed a little western thought to get me from point a to point b, but it turned out, that all I needed to do was relax and trust myself.
