I am writing this a few hours after my spiritual voyage with the sacred mushroom (Psilocybe cubensis). This is not my first experience with this ally. In previous encounters, I discovered worlds I did not know could possibly exist, and these experiences completely changed my orientation towards life. But I would say that they only acquainted me with the psychedelic realm; I had only gotten my toes wet up until today. I say this not because those experiences were any less profound, mind-shattering, or important to who I am as a person, but because I really wasnt prepared for them in the way I was for todays journey. Following those experiences, which also included numerous other ones with allies like LSD and DMT, I took a roughly two year break to integrate what I had learned. Notably, I became acquainted with the palette of philosophies and religions of the Far East, totally new to me, which helped frame my experiences incalculably better than my Western tradition did. In addition, I started a semi-regular meditation practice to cultivate equanimity of mind, a skill I certainly lacked. Armed with these new skills and tools, along with a much more intentional, planned, and ceremonial approach, I had a highly productive and beneficial trip. As any psychonaut or spiritual traveler knows, these journeys are ineffable and difficult to lay out in linear prose. What follows is my best attempt at recalling the journey.
