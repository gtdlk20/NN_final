Eventually, I simply became overwhelmed with the vastness of the universe and the fact that in the grand scheme of things, I don't matter, my problems don't matter, and I'm not even a blip on the map of the universe.  Feeling so hopeless and meaningless, I was never as capable of killing myself as I was that night.  I could've done it easily without hesitation.  I was even concerned that k might not let me go to the bathroom fearing that I wouldn't come back out.  But I didn't do it.  I wanted to see what happened next.
