Gimpy is the first to trip, he looks at me over his shoulder and starts laughing out loud. Rocko being somewhat high from the first g of weed we smoked laughs with him and I just raise an eyebrow wondering why and saying it's not cool. Then he says my nose is like a banana and some unintelligible stuff. Rocko winks to me and passes the now fully filled bowl.
