This experience taught me a lot, as you can see. Since that trip, I have done extensive research as to their history and the cultures associated with them. Maria Sabina said that mushrooms are the flesh of God. She said that when a healer takes the little ones that spring forth, he becomes as God. I ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and as a result, I sipped the nectar of the fruit of the Tree of Life! Or that is how I felt as a result. Never underestimate the great power of the mushroom and dont forget its ability to create ripples in space time, and cause change in the concept of Self.
