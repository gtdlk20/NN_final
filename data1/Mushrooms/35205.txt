In the end, we rescued the night by going back to my mates house to end the trip where it had started. We smoked a joint and watched Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and during this the trip faded away. Soon after the film I departed to return home. Walking through town the trip reactivated and the streets suddenly became very strange. I started to think a nuclear war or plague or some apocalptic thing had happened while were in the tunnel. I actually enjoyed this experience because deep down I knew that wasnt really true, but there was enough psilocybin and psilocin left in my brain to create that reality on one level of thought. On the bus home the trip faded again, leaving nothing more than bright colours and trippy patterns over my vision.
