When I saw what he had drawn, I asked him if he knew how beautiful what he made was? He had really just doodled some things, and wrote down some of our epiphanies in calligraphy style handwriting. But it was amazing at the time. I tried to draw some things, but IÂ’m not very talented so I stopped. Next time I trip, I will make sure to have paint though because the colors can make up for my lack of talent.
