My attention was distracted and I glanced at the bamboo fence mentioned earlier.  To my horror, it was not made of bamboo, but instead imaciated bodies of what appeared to be tiny people were aranged vertically and woven together in place of the sticks I had seen previously.  Every nick and mark on the fence appeared to me to be tiny horrified faces, limp arms and legs, dark exposed crotches and breasts of these people who in my mind had been brutally killed and hen arranged in this way.  Also, the bodies appears to be rotating counter-clockwise in a hypnotic anner.  I saw in their suffering as the suffering inflicted universally by the strong upon the weak.  Before me was the agony of the innocent in what appeared to be hell, and above me was the perfection of heaven.  I am not a religous person, but the images I was witnessing were making me wonder.  Could there be more to our world than I initially thought?
