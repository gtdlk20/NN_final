She sat next to me, telling me how she thought about me all day, and all the good things about me.  I was finally in a better mood than before, and my visions were no longer frightening.  I was laying down, listening to her, and my eyes were shut.  I saw geometrical patterns of various metallic objects, usually glistening with a rainbow shine across them.  Shapes, eagles, and Indian, and other interesting things, all aligned perfectly geometrically, all shining with wonderful color.  I opened my eyes and looked at my little red light on my stereo.  I put my hand in front of my eye to cover it up, and my hand became transparent.  I could still see the light and its glow.
