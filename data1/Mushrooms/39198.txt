    Within 20 minutes we realized that it was probably a bad idea.  Now I have never had a bad trip.  I always prepare for my trips days ahead of time, and I often meditate so I'm pretty in touch with my mind; however, it quickly became apparent that my friend was not.  I went from having visuals to feeling like, and believing that I turned into a puddle of water.  This was because i have spilled some water on myslef.  I was very content being a puddle of water and enjoyed myself thoroughly.  My friend on the other hand, whom I later found out had a history of mental illness, lost control.  We quickly realized that he wasn't alright, we had seen him trip many times before and he never had acted like this.  He could not see anyone, hear anyone, or speak.  He could let out a few squeals and shreaks of terror.  He began trashing everything in his path.  Knocking over anything that he was near, I tried my best to restrain him but he now had superhuman strength and me being a puddle of water at the time didn't help either.  What happened next was somewhat of a blur but I think what happened was I was so frightened that I ran out to my car where I fell asleep.
