I had done a lot of reading (mostly on the internet) about mushrooms, and more importantly, I had thoroughly quizzed a friend of mine (I'll call him RP) who was an experienced psychedelic user.  RP was attending this party as well, and he said that he would be glad to watch out for me should I choose to use mushrooms at the party.  There is no doubt in my mind that the comfort factor of having a 'babysitter' contributed to the pleasant nature of the experience.  The general mood of the party was nice.  Everyone was sharing water, food, tents, etc.
