I hadn't touched the stuff, or any powerful hallucinogen, in around a year, and I was experiencing my own share of anxiety for a number of reasons. Firstly, my mushroom experience had been a mixture of good and bad, the bad stemming mostly from the digestive aspect. I strongly preferred the LSD concept of placing a minuscule piece of paper on my tongue, to swallowing large amounts of vile tasting dried fungus. Also, I had been cast in the role of a guide by my friends, who assumed I possessed some sort of infinite wisdom on the topic of drugs. Sure I had done my share of reading, (most of it by Timothy Leary) but my actual experience was somewhat limited, and the knowledge that I hadn't tried these drugs in so long made me worry if I could maintain control throughout the night. I still felt as prepared as possible, having done a great deal of thinking about the evening, as well as reading some trip reports on the net and getting a good night's slee.
