My times in the past consuming mushrooms have been powerful indeed, and have taught me much of the notion of oneness and infinitude as experienced earlier in the gathering, but never before have I received such powerful visions of myself in such a clear, vivid and purely neutral and indiscriminate way. Now alone in this endless void of winter I was forced to face every single aspect of myself and every single aspect of all my relationships. But there was no fear, no negativity, no hatred. Only calm and love. I was completely at peace with who I was. I was completely at peace with who I was. I did not smile for I was not happy, but nor did I frown for I was not sad. I was in a complete state of neutrality, tranquil equilibrium, true, unbiased, unconditional Love for myself and all things. I was in a complete state of neutrality, tranquil equilibrium, true, unbiased, unconditional Love for myself and all things.
