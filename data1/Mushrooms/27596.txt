I stood up and walked down the hallway to my own room and remembered each moment, each sound, each word as it passed into my sensorium like when you're watching a film and it seems vaguely familiar and then you realize, 'Oh yes, I've seen this one before.'

But this was merely a corollary of a much larger realization.
