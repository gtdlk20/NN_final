The truffles had worn off by 2100, so the others had some nitrous and I just stuck with where I was at until the last dj's set came on, when I decided to light the DMT pinners. I have found that smoking low doses of DMT causes me to dance really fluidly, something that only ketamine would achieve until I came across DMT. We smoked the first 1 but it only had a slight effect, I think due to it possibly drying out a bit by coming out to festivals with me and waiting for the right time to smoke it. So I got out the 2nd and we smoked that, much better, this bit was a lot fresher and straight away all 4 of us were boogying down like mad. All too soon it ended and the dj thanked the whole festival, I was starting to feel really mellow, like I'd had a valium, so we went back to the tent to have a beer and a few spliffs.
