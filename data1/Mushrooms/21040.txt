 Microdoses helped. About 5% of the original medicine was too much, I felt calm and grounded but a bit out of touch with linear spacetime, and thought that I might not be alert enough to take good care of my toddler. A tiny sip, way less than 1% of what I'd started with, made me feel slightly more grounded and trusting than usual, with no other effects. There was a dose in between that made me feel connected with the mushroom medicine but not at all out of touch with normal waking life, and I wish I'd measured it more precisely because that was the most helpful for integrating the session. When I say "connected," I mean I literally felt that my hands and feet joined my arms and legs into the network that I'd experienced during the session, when the flute music was playing. This sense was totally compatible with my usual way of relating to my body in waking life.
