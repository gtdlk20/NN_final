Anyway, I went home and took the full 15gr. at once. I knew this was going to be a heavy trip, but I have an extended experience with LSD, and more so with microns, a small LSD filled pill in the form of a lighter's fire stone, some say its laced with amphetamine to boost the acid effect, but Im not sure about this and this is of no importance in this report. And, as my friend could not assist me in case things went wrong I would have to undergo it all by myself and crawl out of hell by myself in case it'd turn bad. Its a test of self knowledge and self testing which I have always passed gloriously.
