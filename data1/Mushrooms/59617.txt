We knocked on his door but no one was in, so proceeded around the side to his back garden, as if we had just found the portal to the secret garden. The grass looking so plush and fantastic, changing from green to purple, the three of us talking to each other in amazement of what we were witnessing in front of us, totally loving the surroundings, all with a smile reaching from one ear to the other planted on our faces. Ollie came up through the back gate with a few more friends just coming back from scoring some ganja. We proceeded into his house and up to his room where the bongs started getting passed around.
