We eventually made it downtown into a parking garage. Getting out of the truck, my entire body felt like a jelly. I was very wavy although I had no trouble standing. I had read other reports of people experiencing patterning in objects. Frankly, I had no idea what this meant until I started walking out of the garage. In my peripherals it seemed everything turned into fractals, small patterns repeating everywhere. I saw a lot of lights being criss-crossed even though I couldnt directly look at them. My vision, too, seemed to be improved. Movement in my peripheral vision was increased. I felt like I could see around my entire head, 360°. It was as if someone had cleaned my eyes.
