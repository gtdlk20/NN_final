I didn't feel anything initially, but after Bard took his first dose and I took my gram, we smoked a bowl of cannabis, and it seemed to boost my high a little bit.  After we had smoked the bowl, it had been about 40 minutes since the intake of the mushrooms.  I felt a tingle go from my tounge, to my cheeks, gums, and all the way through my head.  It was a very unique feeling.  Shortly after that, Bard and I decided to have sex, and it was felt amazing.  I was very hyper-sensative to everything around me.
