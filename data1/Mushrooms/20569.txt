Abruptly I wasn't where I was before. I was floating in a dark eerie quiet space staring up at a full moon, dark blue fading into black. There were stars surrounding this queer moon but only in a skinny oval egg-like shape, like an eye standing on end. There was a silky like material gliding and rippling over the moon and stars like a pale, translucent scarf. I was struck by a feeling that this was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life. It made me hopeful, sad. I wanted to look at it forever.
