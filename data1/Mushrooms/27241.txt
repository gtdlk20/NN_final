When I shut my eyes I saw blackness, but sometimes a random image would appear.  When I laid next to and hugged my girlfriend, I shut my eyes and saw a forest, and then a group of vivid flowers.  I laid back down on my side, and shut my eyes.  I felt buzzed and realized I should get some food and water in my body, seeing how I did not eat or drink much, and threw up as well.
