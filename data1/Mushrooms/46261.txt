After the long train and bus ride we finally arrived at AQWA around 12.30 giving us 45 minutes for it to kick in. This gave us enough time to look around the place before we got too screwed over. One of the best features of AQWA is a huge underground tank called the Ship Wreak Coast which has glass tunnels through it allowing you to pass beneath the various sharks, stingrays, turtles and fish while not even moving since thereÂ’s a conveyable on the ground. This we decided to save our first look at this when we were tripping hard.
