Again, I am traveling to the future and back. I can't explain what I saw or what my mind was percieving at that point. I guess I blacked out. The next thing I remember is snapping back into reality. All of a sudden I knew me! I knew where I was! The unknown is over! I talked to D about what happened. When he told me I went into a shroom hole I couldn't believe it. I guess I was unresponsive for an hour, but WOW! What an hour....
