This all began when I ordered some mushrooms from a dutch website (sorry but they no longer provide this interesting service) I recieved my package and examined the twisted fungi with awe. Me and a mate were to trip together that summer but I wanted to try them out right there. It was about 6pm in the summer and I had an exam the very next day.
