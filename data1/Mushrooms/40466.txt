About this time his mom comes in the room and asked if I wanted some pizza I mumbled no but it came out more as a meh. She understood I guess and left the room. One thing you should know about this family is there very very anti drug. After she left I could here his parents talking. His dad was on the phone saying stuff like 'I HAVE NO IDEA WHATS GOING ON! HE WANTS TO PAINT THE WALLS YELLOW! I HAVE NO CLUE HE WANTS ME TO MAKE A THING CALLED DIJORNE! DORIAN I HAVE COOKED IT 8 FUCKING TIMES I CANT GET IT PERFECT!' I could also hear his little brother and sister running up and down the hallway screaming at the top of there lungs 'I'm SHROOMING I'm SHROOMING!!!' about this time I was thinking shit...were caught. So many thoughts were running through my head now 'what if his parents kill me for corrupting there child or something, what if the cops come and arrest me? What if I have to go to the hospital? My parents wont be mad but they will be pissed about the hospital bill!' then they just stoped. All the thoughts did. I started looking at the tv in his room and it turned on to show a triangle that eventually started changing into other shapes. It was very colorful and intrigued me alot. Eventually it got boring so I started looking around the room. His walls were changing color so I stared at them. I didnt know were Dorian was but his parents were sure yelling at him allot. Then I thoght 'why arent they getting me and asking me what happend? Maybe they did but I dont remember it. Then the shrooms kicked in harder.
