I went upstairs with great effort, and probably some intermittent dancing. I attempted to read a book, but began to lose sight of what I was working on, and decided to quit that task. I worked from room to room very slowly. I managed to come to the doorway of the upstairs bathroom. I turned the light on, and the wall amazed me more than ever before, it was constantly dying and being reborn. It was faux-painted in a blue purple tinge, and I found this constant birth and death to be pleasing in its infinite mortality. A ladder's cast shadow on the wall pleased me in its resemblance to some far off thought. It was beautiful, because it would end, and it the same time it became so saddening I felt that I might cry.
