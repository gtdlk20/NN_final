I suddenly realized that I had found the true Sitio of this place for me, the Seat of Power, like Don Juans first strange lesson to Castaneda, the importance to the Sorcerer of finding that Sitio and not confusing it for some other.  I knew then (but kept it to myself) that the Seat of Power in this place would not be for me the Eagles Nest.  I explained that here in this situation, seated in this overlook, the last of the Nausea was being transformed from sickness to Power inside my belly.
