6:00- we went back outside and it was freezing,very much freezing. Suddenly I felt the urge to go home and to the warmth of my bed and just lay there. Reality came back that I could not go home yet or I would be clearly caught and have very aqward conversations with my parents. I was still freezing though, we had the hardest time trying to decide what to do and where to go. I just wanted warmth, that was all I was seeking. Then we struck up the idea to walk. I began doing odd warm ups and running around, which got me warm and fuzzy. Suddenly all those horrible feelings that swarmed me went away, I was good, ready to take on the world. When I stared at anything, it seemed to move, everything was alive. The sky was purple, the pavement was purple, very odd.
