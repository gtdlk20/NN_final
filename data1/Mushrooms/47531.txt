We walked across the field back into the creepy woods. I felt like I wasnÂ’t moving at all on the walk over. Like I was watching a big life movie. On walk my arm brushed my wallet chain and I felt like metal. My arms seemed to grow in size and fingers melted together. I tried not to look at my body after that. We got into the woods and lay down on the gross ground and garbage there that was strangely comfortable. I think I about peaked here. I had a ridiculous mesh over my vision that made everything flow and move around. I felt like whatever I touched. So impossible to explain. I touched a boxing glove, styrofaom, blanket, cans, leaves, and trees and felt like that material. My body would seem like it was made of it. I got the idea that in your life you get the chance to feel like what it is to be every kind of matter with shrooms.
