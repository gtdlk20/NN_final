It is also of note that this whole time (except for the couple times we lit up joints), I was only mildly 'fucked up', with minor visuals/tracers, and yet I would have it no other way.  The sheer ecstasy (I use this term, and even though I've done E a few times in the past, I can say that the psychological euphoria I felt during all this felt far more real and deeper than anything E ever gave me) was so noticable that I wouldn't have it ruined with some sort of dopamine rush or reality-twisting visuals.
