At this point I went back downstairs into the kitchen, where a large group of people were standing around talking. I went up to them, interrupted the conversation, and started talking philosophy (I am a philosophy + mathematics student). I was mainly discussing the ideas in Ludwig Wittgenstein's 'Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus', and although I'm pretty sure nobody understood what I was talking about, it all made sense to me.
