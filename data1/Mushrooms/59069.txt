Later on in the day we went to Spencers. This place was like heaven. I was in the black light section and I was off in my own little world. Everything was so cool, all the lasers and little special effect lights had my full attention. I wondered around for a little bit in the store by myself, until I heard Lisas hard gut type laughter. She was in the front of the store with Casey. He had yet again started to mess with our heads.
