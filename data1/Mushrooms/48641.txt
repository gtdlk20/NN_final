Its twelve o'clock, my the second batch of mushrooms seems to be kicking in. Everything I see and do seems to be looping, like some continuous deja vu. I shut the music off because its just so intense I can bearly stand it. I decide it's about time to slip into the darkness and put on the hours of pink Floyd I had on my playlist. so I turn off all the lights, tape off any little small light source there is in my room. I lay down in bed and throw my headphones on and spark up a spliff. This is where shit went crazy.
