There we were, tripping our asses off, surrounded by a dancing red and blue light pattern cast by the cops lights, with a spotlight in our eyes-- Not a good situation to be in your first time tripping. The cop came out of his vehicle, took our IDs, and went back in his car, slightly tilting the spotlight as though he were examining us. Nader and I kept saying to each other 'he has nothing on us, he hasnt seen us do anything wrong...' I had to struggle to keep my composure, as my mind kept forgetting about the police and instead focusing on the sights and sounds introduced by the situation. After about 10 minutes he came out of his car and said some BS about how he thought we tripped a burglar alarm in an office building that we hadnt even come close to (This isnt the first time I was stopped by cops in my town for some completely random thing I hadnt done). he made us walk to the office while he drove behind us (possibly a trick to see if we were drunk or something), but Nader and I were able to control ourselves perfectly. When we got there, there was another officer waiting for us, and they interrogated us with the usual questions: 'where did you come from?' 'where were you going?' 'what are you doing this late at night?' and blah blah blah. All the while they carefully watched our eyes and body language for signs of fear, doubt, and untruthfulness.
