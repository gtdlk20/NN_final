These mushrooms came on strong, no waiting, no thinking Im starting to feel something when Im not. They hit full tilt boogie. When a mushroom trip starts, its a deffinate feeling of 'oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, ohshitohshitohshitohshit!' I can see how this would scare a person new to them, because it was mildly uncomfortable to me, and I'm used to it. The muscles in my legs began contracting for several seconds at a time before releasing. The same for my arms and neck. Not that it was uncomfortable after several minutes, really. It was all wildly hilarious to both of us. We got the same giggling experience I used to get off of marijuana when I first started smoking. Laughing for no reason. Spirits generally high. By this time things had started to take on a soft glow and things on the walls had started to barely move.
