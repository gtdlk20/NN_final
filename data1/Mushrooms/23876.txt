The second time, I smoked a few bowls of mushrooms with some friends.  It tasted pretty bad, but not so much that it wasn't bearable.  My friend had eaten nearly an eighth of the mushrooms before I showed up and smoked with him (he had purchased them at a rave), so he was tripping balls, while I knew I felt something different from a normal marijuana high.  Once again we later smoked cannabis and that overpowered the mushroom sensation for me.  My friend and I are often known to make strange music on the spot, and this night was no exception.  I got my guitar out and played and sang, while my friend sang, drummed and rapped to the beat.  Two girls had smoked the weed with us, but not the mushrooms, and they sat and watched our show.  Everybody was in a great mood, the music sounded awesome.
