I had the usual anxiety, jaw-clenching come-on, and I did about sixty laps around the kitchen/living room area while my brother prepared some salmon for the grill.  After about fortyfive min. I found myself closely observing the intricate swirls of color in a print he has framed in the living room. My buzz was coming on so hard and fast I almost bashed my head through the glass in the frame. It was as if the color were sucking me into the painting.
