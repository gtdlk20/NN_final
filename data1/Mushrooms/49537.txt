We eventually found the right elevator and room. I fell onto the bed, feeling relieved to be away from the noise, smoke, everything out there. Lying there, we realized that this was the trippersÂ’ room. The wall was a bluish tile that had become the ocean. The bed had psychedelic sheets and the artwork was insane. And everything was breathing and moving. We must have been about two and a half hours into the trip and I couldn't believe how intense the visuals were, like nothing that I had experienced before. I basked in the craziness of it all, enjoying every moment. I gathered all the energy and gumption in my system and called my friend to tell her about the trip. I believe that I mentioned the visuals, but I can't remember much more than that. I do remember hanging up because I had to go to the bathroom. I also remember spending a good portion of the rest of the trip in there.
