I was tripping balls now. I could see deeply into each and every one of my friends' lives. I felt very judgmental at times. I could see how childish we all were acting, and how little we knew. The fire seemed to leap out onto us in a dancing red visual display. The long wooden pipe stretched and shrank. I could no longer feel the jittery begging of the high, nor the buzz from the pot. A strong glow seemed to be coming out from inside me and pulsating every part of my body. I saw blurred tracers when I moved my arms and I began flailing them around in a sort of drunken state to intensify the tracers. I remember throwing the elongating and shrinking pipe to the ground and saying, 'This is just like Alice in Wonderland!' I looked at my cell phone to check the time. The digital numbers seemed to morph into an Elven language I couldn't understand. After a few minutes more of straining to figure out the time, I realized I was more fascinated by the lighted phone display than anything. I saw the names and numbers in the phone book of my family and friends, and emotion surged through my body. I wished they could all be with me by the fire. I thought of my dad, who no longer did drugs, but he could almost be there with me through his love.  I thought of my dad, who no longer did drugs, but he could almost be there with me through his love. It was freakin' intense. I could have tripped out for what seemed like hours just imagining the thoughts and feelings of my loved ones.
