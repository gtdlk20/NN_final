It was early June, my cousin and I had just been granted a view into nature.  We setup camp in our lovely mountain canyon and began eating. (with the assistance of Subway sandwiches....making sure I put them directly into the juicy parts of the sandwich, let sit for 5 mins( to get rid of the crunchyness))
