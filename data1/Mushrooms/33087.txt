I lose track of time and any idea where I am. Peoples transparent bone arms start to form into knives and sharp points as I walk past them, and I can see liquid goo in all the trash cans. There is some metal robotic NASA stuff around that completely looks like weapons or demonic torture devices, but I stear clear and am not afraid. Every surface is covered in kaleidoscopic circles bending into each other. The vividness of this candyland I've found myself in can only be compared to the single time I smoked nn-DMT, with patterns not only moving along the surface but also appearing to wobble towards or away from me like liquid. I spend a great deal of time staring at these surfaces, trying not to look at people to prevent them from changing into frightening abominations.
