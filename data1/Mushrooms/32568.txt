I was in another planet, this had been the case of all night, but it was so strange. I saw myself as not a person or human being, but as just another living organism of cells and atoms, I was nothing important to this world, the world was small compared to the universe, we were nothing. I could see the world from the view of space and it scared me sort of, but gave me a deep understanding to life. A sacred understanding like, it feels like its unexplainable.
