I was talking, online, with one of my friends about my problems with life. I think that that journey was the best experience of my life. I realized my faults and Ive tried to fix them. My second trip was MUCH more intence than my first. This weeked Im going to write down a list of things to do and take 1/2 of a piece of the magic chocolate, in the woods with a close friend. I plan on focusing on my CEVs(closed eye visuals) focusing on music, writing down my feelings and my new found knowledge drawing and having a meaningful conversation.
