As I lay in the darkness at the end of my trip, I lost all sense of identity completely.  I entered a fugue state, not knowing where I was, who I was, or who I was with.  I thought I had died; the ordeal I went through was unimaginably taxing on my psyche and I thought it had killed me.  I asked my roommate where we were and who we were, under the impression that we both had died and that our souls were about to move on to our next lives.  I just wanna remember everything, my roommate said at one point.  I thought he was referring to his past life and agreed, although he was obviously referring to his trip.  I thought that this mysterious goddess that showed me the two outer limits of the spectrum of love and hate had placed us both in a sort of waiting room, and just before I thought we were about to pass through the wall and out into eternity, onto our next lives, I snapped back to reality.
