When I left the theatre, everyone's face was melting too!! So we decided to walk home.  When I got to our village I was still seeing oompaloompas and there was a tree that looked like a massive orgy with a dead oompaloompa in it.  The mud was morphing into goats, lincoln, lion and several other faces.  I was particular about my feet being clean because it was muddy (rainy weather).  But me and one of my friends started playing and jumpng in the mud!  One of my friends was playing with the tube and funnel of a beer bong (we didn't have beer) and when someone called her phone, she stuck the funnel on her ear and the phone on the other!  Then I had to go to the bathroom, the first thing I noticed when I got inside was the tiles! It was so cute and just nice to look at... I could have got stuck there! The trip was relatively long cause we ate the shrooms at 2:40pm and I was still shroomed til about 9 and later! It was far out!
