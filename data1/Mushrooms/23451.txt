12:00 a.m. As I was lying on the couch trying not to melt, I once again could feel myself rising to another level. This level was very cool, yet extremely emotional. My iPod docking station was playing some Guster and I was deeply involved with it. I could feel the sound waves rush out and hit me as every note was played. I had all these ideas that seemed so great and historic and I was going to write them down but when I got up to get a pen and paper, I had no idea what I was up for. This getting up and wondering what IÂ’m doing happened numerous times during my trip so I just dealt with them as they came. I then knew what I wanted. I wanted to see a visualizer.
