About fifteen minutes later, I found myself staring at MTV Cribs, possibly the most annoying show on earth, not understanding a damn word P. Diddy was saying about his stupid Cadillac with 'Gangsta-Rappa' painted on it from one of his 'thug brutha's'. I don't mean to come off racist or anything, but I am a critical son of a bitch when I'm high. Do you notice how you can point out bad acting on a movie or a sitcom when you're on weed?
