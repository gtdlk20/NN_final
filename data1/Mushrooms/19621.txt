Suddenly I entered 2001: A space Odyssey. I understand where those visions do come from.  Sometimes I open my eyes and I go back to the altered reality. The wood board ceiling is my solid reality with which I can keep in contact, even if the veins and nodes are floating. I assume a foetus-like position under the blanket. In the black cocoon I can create whatever realm I like, with no interferences. I have all kinds of visions: wonderful dragons/demons flying in the space, gold rings with turquoise, jade and lapislazuli inlay whirling, like snake skin that create an esoteric symbol with an infinite power. The union of these rings can give me complete comprehension of everything, the absolute conscience. Then everything turn to silver, and it becomes like an opera set that exits the proscenium leaning toward the audience.
