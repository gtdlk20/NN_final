We then preceded to explore the house, and I found laying on the floor very comfortable. I went into the bathroom, I forget why. I no longer knew how to manage my body. I didn't know if I wanted to eat or throw up or pee or drink. But the bathroom seemed right. When I arrived in there, it changed into a whole other world. It was dark, but it seemed like the walls were shiny and slightly wet, dripping with color. Bill came in, and somehow we ended up entwined, sprawled on the floor of this bathroom in the dark. His body was no longer form, he was just a shape and a voice. Everything felt like a puzzle, the way the colors and our voices and our bodies fit together in this dark, wet world. It was then that I realized I had lost all feeling of my body, I could have been drooling or vomiting and not known. I forgot where my mouth was. The whole trip became a quest to hold my body together, and keep from drifting forever into space and time and color.
