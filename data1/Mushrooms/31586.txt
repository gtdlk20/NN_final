As my conversations with the mushroom continue. my friend (well call him Bob) talks about how great it is to be human. At this point I couldnt agree more. (NOT because of what humans are doing to this planet but what potential we have).  Ever since we reached the summit, eyes had been appearing on the nature path along with the same fractal patterns. When I focused on what was making these patterns I saw the physical objects. In a sober state I know i was just blind to these fractals.
