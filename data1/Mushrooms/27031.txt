I felt myself slipping away from my normal reality, my auditory perceptions were screaming, and I was hearing things (physically hearing them) that were not there. The things I saw with my eye were equally as clear as the images I perceived in my head. I began physically talking to myself saying things like Just hold on and dont give in I didnt completely understand what I was saying or why I was saying it, but looking back I did have the sensation of being pulled away from my reality and I instantly associated that with death and my death. I had visions of headlines in a paper about a boy (boy not a man) dying in his home over the weekend. I had images and impressions of what my family would think and how they would feel. I felt sadness at not being able to see them one more time before I kicked the bucket.
