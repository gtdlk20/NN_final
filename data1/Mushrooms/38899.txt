To sum it all up, I'm not really regretful nor am I glad that I ate magic mushrooms that night. I'm not sure if I will ever do that again. It does change how I look at the world, but not necessarily in a bad or negative way. I feel as if there are multiple realities, planes of thought, experience, living patterns. Just be careful, be safe, and learn to respect Nature and it's wonderful powers.
