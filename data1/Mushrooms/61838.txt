I could not go in my house because my parents were awake and everything was still moving around. I walked around my neighbourhood for an 1 1/2 hours till everything slowly started 2 stop moving. When I was walking in my neighbourhood, my pants fell off, and I put them back on, but it felt like they were still on the ground. Very weird and funny. It was a clear sky and I could see so many stars and they were all wavy. I climbed on the top of the hill near our pond and thought about life, and how amazing mushrooms were.
