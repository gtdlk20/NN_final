A couple of friends of mine decided to watch Charlie and the Chocolate Factory th weekend it opened.  We supposedly were 10 people who were going to split two jars.  Unfortunately two friends backed out.  Me and my friends fit in one row in the theatre.  Before the movie started, my brother, my boyfriend and I  halfed one jar (4 tablespoons each).  We weren't taking any prescriptions or anything.
