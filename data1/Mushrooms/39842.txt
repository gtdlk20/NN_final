Now, I've taken 3 grams of mushrooms before, but nothing ever happened like that.  It was, bar none, my ultimate psychedelic experience (DMT notwithstanding).  What was originally planned to be a moderately recreational dose turned out to be a psychic reformation.  It was extremely cleansing in the end; to completely break down and rebuild can have a very refreshing effect, despite the horrifying glimpse into the nether realms.  It's a bit like sweeping the cobwebs from the mind.  I also realized how blessed I was in life to have a loving girlfriend.  Being on the verge of nothingness made me re-evaluate the things I truly appreciate and love in life.
