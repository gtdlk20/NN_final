For the first while we sat in the kitchen talking.  It came on slow, but faster than I thought it would.  I was told lights would get brighter and appear to glow.  After about 30-40 minutes, I started to feel a little strange, but nothing special.  I grabbed some paper nearby and began to draw and listen to my friends talk.  I lost track of time, but after about an hour or more later I was feeling very strange.  I couldnt connect where I was with memories of the rest of my life.  I knew I was living, and i knew where i was, but i wasnt sure why i was there.  I wasnt sure if i was enjoying myself or not, but I felt very good.  Im not sure how to explain it, but i felt almost reborn, like my body was fresh and new.  My friend on the 4gs would repeat his plans for the night about every 5 minutes for the next 3 hours.  This was very frustrating.  He would repeatedly ask me if i was 'feeling it'.  He seemed stressed and asked if I wanted to 'just go to sleep'.
