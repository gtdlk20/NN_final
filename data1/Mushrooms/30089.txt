We set up an altar, bringing together the elements of the consecration ceremony (holy water, oil, incense) and about 10 dried grams of the sacred mushrooms and allied tea ingredients (fresh lemon, ginger root, mint leaves & green tea).  Donning white robes, Ouranoboros performed the traditional ceremony upon Logos, invoking God in all His, and Her, and Its sacred forms and aspects, laying hands on head and anointing power-points (third eye, hands and feet), finally announcing this newest Bishop with a suitable reading from the Gnostic scripture: The Thunder, Perfect Mind (rediscovered as part of the Nag Hammadi find of 1947).  Blessing the mushrooms as the Living Eucharist, Bishop Logos and I thanked the Holy Host for agreeing to connect with us as Living God and Guiding Spirit, speaking aloud our highest intentions for the trip:  Inspiration and Intuition, Adventure and Excitement in a safe and loving way, to descry answers to personal questions in the mirror of Nature, to combine paths of Magic and Psychedelia creatively and positively, and above all, to open us both up to Hidden Powers and Divine Assistance in all manners of need, that might yet be unconscious to ourselves, so that the God of Psilocybin might make us more conscious of, and for, our highest good.
