The month was August, year 2009. The night began as any other summer night. It was about 9:30pm, I was hanging out with my current female interest at the time and we were partaking in the timeless teenage ritual of driving around, blowing clouds of thick, white, lacy smoke. I took her to a park and we had a great time walking around in the dark wooded park and laughing in our young lust. I had received a text from one of my best friends; well call him Dee for privacy reasons. Dee had shown up earlier that day when I had punched out of my job as a cashier at Stop and Shop. We played Frisbee in the parking lot for a little while until he brought me to his car and showed me a bag of brown earthy-like chunks. I immediately thought they were what are commonly referred to as shrooms. I hadnt taken them before but I had heard stories from a few acquaintances that had, and one of them described it as becoming superman which I thought sounded appealing enough. Dee didnt ask me to take them right then and there, he was just showing them to me. However, the text I received from him while I was storming the castle of Girldom, had me overjoyed. He asked me to co me to his house around eleven to try the shrooms with him. I explained this to my female companion and she had understood I had to go. I dropped her off at her car at about 10:30pm. My night was off to a great start and I was excited for the new experience I was about to partake in however, I had no idea that this night would be the most influential night of my entire existence.
