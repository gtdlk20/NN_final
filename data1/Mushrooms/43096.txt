Peter and I talked back and forth about the feelings we had under the influence for a few moments in our mushroom-induced stupor. If you had been sober and listening in on our conversation I can almost guarantee it wouldnt have sounded like much more than a series of grunts and mumbles, yet we could understand each other perfectly, as if we had the ability to read each others thoughts. Finally I remember speaking again, saying something this time like, Shrooms are really fun. We both fell quiet for a brief second, before I quickly added, Butapart. Instantly I could feel the atmosphere throughout the room change, and I could feel something drop in the put of my stomach.
