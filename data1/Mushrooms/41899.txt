T+40 mins and the tree to my right started getting an iridescent sheen to it, and would breathe a little. When I closed my eyes I got vague patterns moving. Around this time I noticed a man fishing around the other side of the lake and became mildly self-conscious, which is disappointing because I found myself naturally slipping into a deep meditative state when I focused on my breathing. Being self-conscious, I didnÂ’t follow that feeling.
