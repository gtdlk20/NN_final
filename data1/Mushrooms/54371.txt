A vital aspect for me is the examination of what is causing trauma and depression, especially in todays world where so many young people cannot see the point of living any more.  Something has gone terribly wrong for us as a modern species when we have everything, yet cannot see the point of it all.  These trip and the contemplation and research following them have shed a very strong light on these issues and their origin for me and I can now work with the concepts learned to navigate past common anxiety, fear, pain and suffering from mental knots and blockages.  The work of Ian McGilchrist (left brain-right brain), Stanislav Grof (transpersonal psychology) and the musings of Gurdjieff (full body, mind and spirit awareness), Ramana Maharshi (Self exploration), Terence McKenna (Hyperspace and Language) and Sadhguru (Tantric freedom) have certainly provided me with great assistance and insight into roads out of mental deadlocks.  To quote a Tantric wisdom: Ones level of happiness is directly related to ones embrace of Mystery.  We cannot live on our Left Brain alone  the Right Brain is of vital importance to balance out the reductive, analytical, cold logic with fantastical, mystical, creative narrative.  The felt Moment of Immediate Experience, as McKenna would call it.
