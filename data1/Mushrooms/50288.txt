Anyway, the next day I woke up around 10 and the plan was to eat a little lunch and then eat the shrooms and head down to the event.  I found that I couldn't down much food, which isn't rare for me, but this time it wasn't because I felt full so much as jittery.  I figured I was just nervous about the coming experience (it had been a while since my last real drug experience, and the movie was of course still ringing in my head) and that I would just get over it and have a good time: bad idea.
