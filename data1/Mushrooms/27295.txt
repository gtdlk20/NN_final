I looked at bill, and I could just see that he's still so insecure and he has no idea who he is and what to do with himself. I saw that all he does is whine, and try to get attention, sympathy, for his (kind of pathetic) life. I realized how sad he is, I never knew before. Anyway, this was an insight to myself and how strong I am, and I learned a lot. It's all about exploring, seeking yourself. My only warning is, take a smaller dose your first time, because feeling sick does really jade it. But, if you are tripping hardcore, just close your mouth and your eyes and find your center, your balance, and that's all you need. Explore. Find yourself, and allow yourself to believe.
