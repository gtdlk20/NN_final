After I left the porta-pottie, I met back up with my friends and we went back to our campsite. The next highlight of this trip was the sunset. I've seen a lot of sunsets but this one was the most beautiful and surreal one ever. The combination of the setting sun and all the tents, cars, and people, made for a very strong visual setting. Once the sun was gone, is when people starting launching fireworks. Four hours after finishing the tea, and seven hours after starting it, I was still shrooming very hard. The sounds and visuals from the fireworks are unexplainable, at least through text.
