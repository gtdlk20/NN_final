He started talking to me about school starting and how I was going to be a senior.  I was having such a hard time talking to this guy.  It was almost like I was drunk and slurring but not quite.  I had trouble spitting out the first word of every sentence I said, but once I got out the first word everything was normal.  I knew this guy was noticing this so I told him I had the flu and wasnt feeling good and was really hot and had to get a shower.  But instead of leaving me alone he followed me to the shower. Once I was able to stumble into the bathroom I couldnt understand a word he was saying because the bathroom echoes, so I was just nodding and saying yea to what ever he said.  I got in the shower and it felt so good being in shower.  The water was just such a great refreshing feeling.  The only problem was John was still talking to me and I couldnt understand him at all.  There I was tripping hard 30 minutes away from peeking, everything was wavy, sounds were echoing, water was spraying full blast and this kid John was talking to me about some stupid bullshit I couldnt audibly comprehend.
