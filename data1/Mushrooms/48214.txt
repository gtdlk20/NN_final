I bought them with the intention of splitting them with K, but after some inner debate, I decided I wanted a truly unique experience, because I had just had a really bad acting audition. I know that supposedly taking psychedelics after a bad experience is a bad thing to do, but Ive done it now more than once, with X and shrooms after my I broke up with my girlfriend, and it always makes my day, and life better, not worse. I did get a little freaked out at the onset, about 30 minutes after I ate the first cap, but that wasnt because of my life, it was because I had never taken so much before. My last experience had only been with .75 grams wet after taking X 5 hours earlier, and my largest single dose aside from this was my first time tripping, which was not an 1/8th but a lot of shrooms. They were 100% fresh, and my friend and I had never taken them before and didnt have a scale, so we just downed some. I consider myself very sound of mind, but Id never taken this much before, and the coming up was very strong. I simply put on some music and waited for the anxiousness to subside. And when it didoh boy.
