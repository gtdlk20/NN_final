Fair warning: ever since that trip, on certain occasions and in a certain state of awareness Ive been able to see my surroundings breath a bit in the same way as in the beginning of the trip. So I guess the trip changed my perception for good to some extent. Another effect that Ive connected with the mushroom trips (Ive had 4 now that Im writing this) is that I seem to be more emotionally unstable, verging on crazy sometimes. However, I also feel this is sort of a good thing: the trips have brought to the surface something that has been with me all along, my inner conflicts and fears, and now I can resolve all those issues and find a more stable state of being and true inner peace.
