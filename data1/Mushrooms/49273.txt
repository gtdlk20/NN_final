She was sitting right across from me, and yet I ignored her.  We walked down to the beach and I regretted not actually retrieving my swimsuit.  The clarity of the water was so beautiful with the sun reflecting off of it, so I just had to get it.  I took off my shoes and socks and rolled my pants up as high as they would go.  I didn't realize how ridiculous one looks with his pants rolled up to his upper thigh, but I thought nothing of it.  My two companions and I waded out as far as we could go (they were without swimsuits as well) when a group of girls that I knew well showed up with a camera to photograph my pants.  They thought that I was doing it to be funny, which was fine with me, so I allowed them to take a picture.  When back on shore we played the cardgame Bullshit, which I found very interesting and very easy.  I could completely tell when someone was lying about their cards, and for some reason the game actually made sense to me.  I tripped out looking at the mountains and other surroundings until it was time to go.
