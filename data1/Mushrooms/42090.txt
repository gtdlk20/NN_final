The build up was getting faster, and when what felt like the first kick drum from the album came in, I burst through and found myself floating through an infinitely huge collective of these entities whose voices I had only heard before. It was a gathering of the Ageless, a society evolved so far and so precisely that they existed without effort, without physical form and purely of light. They were made of light and of love, and they danced effortlessly and vibrantly to the beat and the flow, moving streamline in their own magnificent shapes that were not meant to be understood by the waking mind. I could feel their energy resonating through me endlessly, throbbing with the same light and the same love that they emanated with such grace and effortlessness. There were moments when I loved the feeling and sensations so much that I begged for me to be a part of them, to join their civilisation, but they were very adamant in telling me that I was merely a visitor, I could not join them. I was a student, here to learn from them and their world, before moving on to the next teacher, whoever, whatever and whenever that may be. I accepted this notion with little quarry, for it is something I had lived by for many years already.
