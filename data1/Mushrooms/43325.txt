I remember reading online of a mushroom trip being described as THE COLORS!, much as an mdma trip being described as THESE CLOTHES! I could understand what they meant. Riding down the highway I had noticed everything seemed brighter, colors more vibrant. Everything, when examined carefully, had an aura of rainbow over it - a highlighting of the edges. I even made a comment one time its really bright for a sun, regarding the brightness of everything. The clouds took on shapes of cloud birds whose movement resembled that of those small 3d books you looked at as kids. Looking at different angles seemed to move the 3d object, but not much. There was also a train we passed which seemed to go on forever. All the train cars were blue and they stretched to infinity.
