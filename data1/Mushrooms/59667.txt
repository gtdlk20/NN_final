And we both kept on walking until we got to our destination. As soon as I got to the dock it started to kick in hard. I was locked in to these trees which seemed to breath like in-hale and ex-hale and was bitching about my stomach. It ended up to be gas as I belched in releaf. We both grew bored rather quick and desided to go to my house again. This time I could feel the different emotions all wrapped up inside me and changing all the time. My vision became bright and beautiful and everything green seemed to glow. We both noticed the same type of this and we just kept going up the hill to my house. We walked back in to see my cusin and his friend toking a a big joint. I asked to hit it and so did Dough-nut and we started to laugh and say 'MAN AM I FRIEING' and 'God I am stoned'. Just ripped out of our minds. The Colors on my cousins wall seemed to move. And I watched them dance all alonge the room. I shook my head and went to the bathroom to try to pull myself together. And still I look to the wall and I see the flowers that are on the wallpaper crawl up and up to nothing.
