On Friday, April 9th, 2004, at 7 P.M. I consumed a little over 2 grams of Psilocybe cubensis, three large stems. This Good Friday trip was the follow up to my first experience with the mushrooms, exactly one week prior to this. The dose then was just half a gram less, but the difference in effects was absurdly unexpected!
