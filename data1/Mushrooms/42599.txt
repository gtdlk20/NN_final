I was tooling around in the game's overworld, rolling around, killing enemies, enjoying the visual effects and music for what seemed like an hour. My thoughts were unusually blank -- I was immersed in the music as well as my favorite game, but I wasn't feeling any euphoria or other mentally stimulating effects of the mushrooms. Just visuals. However this was short-lived. It was the calm before the storm.
