This fungus does not feed the planning mind. This fungus reminds me what I knew all along, but continually forget in the city: that conclusions drawn from specific circumstances cannot logically lead to final solutions. That desperation in suffering in ruined plans and regret and wasted time and impotent rage do not lead to some final edge from which there is no return, but that the edge can be skirted, on the faintest trails that run perpendicular to purpose, to places unsuspected and new. My head may be free of plans for now and enraptured in just-revealed beauty and meaning, but a fact is gnawing. Its in that shred of superego that wears polycarbonate riot gear and wields the baton of anxiety and demands that I behave, that even this, right now, this breathtaking place with me in it worrying the last granules of cattle-manure from my teeth, is a job interview, a place where I need to maintain my guard, to behave, to do what I should. This personal cop reminds me, and reminds me again and again, that I am wrong and I feel shame and loathing and self-loathing and real terror that I will be found, even here. And also the worry that I am now seriously tripping and alone and the light is fading. The westfacing red wall across the valley will get redder and redder for a few more hours, but already Im in shade, and here in the mountains the temperature falls quick and bracing the moment the sun sets. I will spend the night alone and tripping in the cold and I will have terrible clear visions of the wreck of my life.
