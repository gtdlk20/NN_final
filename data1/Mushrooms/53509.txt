After a few hours of taking in the sights, patterns, sounds, smells and people around me, I decided to find somewhere to lie down and explore my own mind. I had to close my eyes for this - when you close your eyes you are officially in your own mind, and what you see is only relevant to you. It is very hard to describe what I saw, but I will try and remember exactly what was there, in my head. An important theme was 'the tunnels'. I was usually travelling forward, but often, I would be distracted by the colorful patterns warping and changing on the walls of the tunnels, and then I would start moving backwards, away from the light that I could see at the end of each one. It took and good deal of focus and determination, but I did get to the end, reached the light, and another vision was exposed to me. Sometimes they were horrible - screaming faces coming out of each other, eyes peering at me, then becoming figures dancing, which would expand out into walls made up of squares positioned in geometric patterns. After each set of visions, there was another tunnel and another struggle to reach the end. It slowly became easier, and eventually I was glided through, very fast, but enough to take in everything. Then everything came to an end, and I think I found my spirit. It was a head, very stiff, very upright, almost African looking. Sometimes it looked at me, other times it didn't, but it was there and it didn't change or shift like the others things I had seen had done. It was a statue, a goal I had reached. I opened my eyes, picked up my notebook, which already had stuff scrawled in it, and began to write again (this was REALLY HARD): here's a view things I wrote, there not very clear, but they might help you to understand how I felt during the trip:
