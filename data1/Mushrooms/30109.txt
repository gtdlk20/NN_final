My talkative friend Logos, weaving a bit on the slope as he struck a line tangential to the mountain ascent, later indicated he was feeling the same nausea and doubts, although he is not yet 30, in good hiking shape and familiar with the medicine.  Apropos to both our minds, he declared aloud forcefully as if announcing to the Universe and not just myself, that Terrence McKenna once said No matter how many times I trip, when I experience that first powerful wave overwhelm me, I always say to myself uh-oh, WHAT HAVE I DONE!? and this is when I (speaking, I think now, as Logos) tell myself over and over Welcome back Old Friend!  Welcome Back!
