We went back inside so I could finish rolling it, and it was incredibly hard this time around to roll it. It was all loosely packed, but still good. We went in the backyard next to this air conditioning unit and I started smoking. The weed was a little weird to hit because I rolled it all shitty, so I got determined and fixed it. Finally, got my smokeable blunt. The air conditioning unit kicked on as I lit the weed. I hit it and it didnt even feel like smoking. It didnt bother my lungs at all and I took these huge hits and smoked it really fast. My friend and I were peaking on our trip and the visuals were fantastic. Fractals and patterns spiraling out and turning my reality into a rainbow crystal, jagged wonderland. The trees were frigid and glass looking, their patterns repeating forever. The stars were zooming around. There was heat lighting out (wasnt just imagining that either) but somehow the stars were still out. Made for a really bizarre habitat I decided to visit that night. So my friend and I get to talking about weird shit, and I get really emotionally invested in some theory about how our money has always been based on gold and its because aliens ingested it for immortality. He was like well what about money that isnt based on gold? and I thought for a moment. I didnt really have an answer for that, except that maybe we were evolving. I couldnt shake this weird, rapidly growing feeling of an epiphany coming on. I thought Why did I cling so hard to that idea when all I can really prove is that I know nothing at all? I knew nothing, I was a speck of dirt. A tiny grain of sand on some cosmic beach, beyond time. If I knew nothing, then I am nothing. If 'I think, therefore I am' were true at all, then I was toast. I might as well not exist. The space around me started to spin, like a dizzy spell of vertigo but in another language, so to speak. This epiphany was too much. Things were about to get really insane.
