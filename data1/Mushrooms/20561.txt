I started massaging my foot with my other and vice versa and the pleasure intensified. It felt as though I wasn't doing it. It felt like it was seperate to me. I knew I was physically doing it but it felt like there was another being there, massaging my feet. The energy sped up. Now it wasn't coming and going in waves. It now filled me with constant ecstacy and my body was moving slowly, rhythmically to this amazing energy. I had never experienced anything like it.
