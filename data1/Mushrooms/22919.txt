I decided to leave the truck and head inside because it was warmer. As I was walking towards the house, I wondered if perhaps the immaturity that living with my parents represented was part of the reason it never worked with Justina. While that may have some validity, I was careful not to blame that failure on this sole factor. There are many reasons why me and Justina never got together. I almost drove myself crazy trying to figure them all out, so I just don't think about it these days. It never progressed to anything sexual and that's that.
