After probably an hour of lying there and just thinking about my life and situations and how grateful I should be to be alive, I decided to shut my mind off completely by focusing on my breath. I then relaxed every muscle in my body and took deep breaths. It was very easy to 'let go' and breath. As soon as I did this, I was catapulted into another realm. Literally, my room was unnoticeable. It had a dark green tint to it and it was almost fluid space, no objects were there. Then all of a sudden a being began hovering right above me about three feet from my body. It was black and had a bright white light projecting out of its chest. I wasnt scared when I saw this being. I remember smiling and saying thank you. I guess to the mushrooms for showing me this other level of reality. The being was just looking down on me. Not doing anything at all but hovering and watching. I could somehow sense that this being was not harmful and felt comforted that I was no longer alone in this experience. We traded glances for what seemed like an hour or two but was probably only a few minutes.
