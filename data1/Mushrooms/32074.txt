Previous experiences: MJ (daily), MDMA, LSD, cocaine, Salvia divinorum, hydrocodone, oxycodone, amphetamines, sedatives, benzodiazepines, sinicuichi, kanna, kratom, blue lotus, amanita muscaria, absinthe, alcohol, and others IÂ’ve surely forgotten. I dabble frequently in the realm of ethnobotanicals, less often in the realm of synthetics only because they are more difficult for me to obtain (which is probably a good thing).
