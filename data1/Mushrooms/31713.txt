After this information was granted to me, the mushroom spoke again. This time giving me personal advice for my specific point of consciousness. The mushroom revealed to me that the ultimate frequency that humans have lost touch with is agape love or better known as unconditional love. This is what matters most it told me, and I realized that an aspect of enlightenment must be agape love. We must learn to think of love before we do anything.
