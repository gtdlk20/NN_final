I wrote a list of things to do and things to remember, played with some music, and settled down to some morning Christian viewing on TV as I settled into that amazing body high and clarity that is trademark to the mushroom experience. Eventually went to sleep by about 7am as I watched the sun rise and had quite a peaceful sleep. Woke up feeling a minor sleep disturbance, but on the whole in a good mood, which later bloomed into a euphoria that lasted me the rest of the week.
