Throughout the year of 2014, I became more and more adjusted to the idea of committing myself sincerely to my spiritual practice; something that has since manifested itself in many wondrous, terrifying ways. Because of this experience, my spiritual practice - with and without the use of substances (more the latter than the former in recent times) - would not be the serious endeavour it has persisted to be, and I am sure it will continue to persist for as long as I hold claim to mortal self.
