The trip was still quite intense up till the part where I opened my eyes and sat up. Now it's pretty much like usual except an accompanied weird feeling. Memories of who I am start coming back but I'm not sure my friend A actually exists. Eventually I meet him and we have sit down and have a chat about what happened.
