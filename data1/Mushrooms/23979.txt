Upon my return from the bathroom I managed with some effort to approach my laptop  now standing on my 'coffee table' (a tired-looking cardboard box turned on its side)  to type a few lines to A, with whom I had discussed tripping on many an occasion. At this point I was quite mentally disorganised but nevertheless with a big, nervous grin plastered on my face and laughter bubbling inside me. As I was attempting to uphold a conversation, he interrupted me gently by saying, 'Go lie down, relax. :)', repeated a couple of times by varying vocabulary until it registered with me. I was deeply touched by how  at least as I perceived it  he had perfectly picked up on how I was feeling. After expressing my deep appreciation and adoration for him I switched on the rugby world championship final, South Africa vs. France (something I would never normally watch, as 1. Im not a sports fan, and 2. rugby makes no sense), and lay down in bed.
