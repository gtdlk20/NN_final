Once we came out of the magical Vondel Park, we jumped on a tram.  This was going to take us to Central Station.  From here we knew where all the life was.  Once the tram started moving, the visuals became amazing.  This was definitely the peak of my trip.  I saw everything look totally fucked up.  All the neon lights trailed and shot colourful lines from them.  It seemed as though I was on a ride at a funfair.  The movement of the tram just added to the amazing visuals that were created from the ever-changing views.  Then I started to think about my existence and my relevance in the Universe.  Suddenly I found all the buildings were just images, blocks, put onto the fabric of the Universe.  As I thought about it, I could see the Universe underneath everything around me.  I perceived it as a green mesh, which everything we know is pasted onto.  This was one of the most amazing things I have ever experienced.  Suddenly, for the first time, I was totally at peace, everything seemed to make sense--life, death, the Universe and more!
