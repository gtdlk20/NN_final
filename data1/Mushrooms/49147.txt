After two hours and I was two thirds done with the tea, I found myself at the movie tent. At the time they were playing the Phish DVD. Normally I try to avoid watching movies or TV while shrooming because its not as affective as looking at still objects, but this tea was some very potent stuff. The movie itself didnt give me many visuals, but the trees, tents, and people you could see just beyond the screen gave watching the movie a very surreal feel. The audio effects while watching the movie were amazing. The music had a different sound to it. The interviews with the band members, combined with the people around me talking, made me hear some very funny and strange things.
