A few months later while on holiday, at the airport she said something which ended with the phrase '...the I could be you and you could be me.' Interesting since I had mentioned none of this to her. The days after the trip were so peaceful and I was filled with love. This lasted till I went back to college and the usual day to day stuff reasserted itself.
