The setting was an outdoor music festival. It's divided into two areas, the festival area itself where the stages were, and the campground. I had been to the festival before but never camped, and this year was the first time I would camp. I was extremely excited for it, as the campground was an experience on its own, a 5 day party with thousands of people, drugs, crazy art, and drums. So many drums at night. There was a large group of us all camping together. Many of them were good friends of mine through work. Others were friends of friends that I had not met before the festival.
