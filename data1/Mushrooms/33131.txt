After a distance we encountered the path again and I had already begun to feel the mild nauseas effects accompanied with a sense of being overheated. We found ourselves eventually strolling at a quickened pace and began to gain on two people ahead of us. And it being only my third time I wanted to negate any discomforts or problems of any sort, so we decided to get off the path again. After a quick scramble up a rock field we began to start tripping and arranged our packs and such into makeshift beds in a little grassy grove amongst the trees. A reflective pool was nearby and a little beyond a waterfall we could drink from. We were all set up just as the we reached our peak. I had sunglasses on as it was such a bright day and found that my visuals of looking up at the clouds were more intense by looking through them.
