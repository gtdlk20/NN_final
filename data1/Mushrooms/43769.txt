It is now 12:20pm, the first mild vision appears, the idents in the wall were popping out of the wall. I thought this was cool but it wasnt that great. I stood up and I felt heavy and light at the same time. I started to walk and I felt like I was flying, literally. I thought I flew from jays living room to his bedroom. All of a sudden the visuals became much more real. I could draw lines with my finger, I saw little people running in the wood grain. That was cool. The little people, there were like elves, they had no idea I was watching them though. Then it got creepy.
