At another moment, I could hardly believe it. I relived a fragment of a dream, from long, long ago. It was definitely from that dream, something about a man on a street and a lamppost that was falling across the street, toward the man but without harming him. As I said, just a fragment. But this lends weight to a theory I have been thinking of, that the tryptamine trance in general and psilocybin's in particular, is a voyage to the world of dreams. This is not as farfetched as it sounds; after all, our dreaming mind is the link to another reality. Call it what you will, transcendental reality, the immanent domain, life after death, the nature of ultimate reality, hyperspace, the unseen dimensions that are the true reality and not this one. What it comes to is that we have built-in the capacity to transcend the physical domain, and that is through our dreaming state. The mushrooms facilitate this.
