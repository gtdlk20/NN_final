10:30: The trip has officially begun. For now I am simply fascinated with the changing colors I see in the lights and the wonderful brightness of the pictures on the wall. But with each coming moment, I can feel everything I know slipping away and this strange, new, moving world taking hold of my brain. A little while after, our girlfriends come back from their drive around town. They come down and inform us that the clock on the wall is an hour slow, but when I look to the clock, it means absolutely NOTHING. I come to the conclusion that time is just a stupid little obsession that humans have and for some reason are always trying to beat the clock. I turn the clock face down and declare problem solved. It is quite scary at how easily one can become obsessed with trying to understand what the time actually means while tripping.
