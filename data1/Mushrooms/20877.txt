Shortly after it was over, I sat up and went to my computer, sent certain messages on Facebook and later on that day made certain phone calls. ItÂ’s corny, but I had to let certain people know that I love them. I then rested my eyes which were painfully sore from crying through the whole experience. I seriously feel I must have cried myself into dehydration. That day I had to go do some errands and drove around in my truck listening to music. It seemed as if all the songs that came on were aimed at me. It felt as if there were no coincidences and everything had meaning.
