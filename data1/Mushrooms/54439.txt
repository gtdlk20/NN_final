If I had to give it a mythical or narrative form, it would be that I was Prometheus and it was Yaldabaoth. The demiurge, the blind god, seeing only itself and proclaiming it is the creator, forgetting it is not without reason or meaning - that you can't have something for nothing. The pit of pits is the thought: "I am, I wasn't before, so I have to always have been. The attempt to comprehend is the thing that throws me back in the loop and starts it again. This is all there is." Over and over and over again.
