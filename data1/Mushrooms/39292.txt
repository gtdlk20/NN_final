When I first ate a chocolate, I was with my girlfriend, in my bedroom, getting ready to go to sleep.  This is probably my most comfortable atmosphere, and I was very excited about taking my first trip.  Based on my research, I expected very little, knowing that each trip is different.  I DID NOT expect to 'see things' or 'trip out,' thinking that this could ruin my mood.  I ate 1/3 of the chocolate, not wanting to over-do it on my first try.  After about 30 minutes I felt nothing, but my pupils were very dilated.  I ate the remaining 2/3 of the chocolate piece, trusting that I could handle whatever happened because my girlfriend would be right next to me for the entire night.
