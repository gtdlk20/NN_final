I do not remember exactly which talk I was listening to at this point, but I'm almost certain it's the YouTube video titled "How to use psychedelics / psilocybin / magic mushrooms remastered". Some would say it's stupid to set up expectations for yourself when taking psychedelics, but this did a lot to get me in the proper mindset to trip. Of course, I can only speak for myself. I made sure to do this on an empty stomach and I know my body has a high metabolism, so it didn't take long to start feeling the fuzzy, weighted embrace of the mushrooms. Still, I had been struggling with the taste and the lemon-mushroom mixture was making my stomach churn. I was psychologically ready and willing for what was about to happen, but I had never had to struggle with nausea like this before. I had no bud on hand and didn't feel like getting up to get anything else to fight the nausea, so I just sat with it and tried to tough it out.
