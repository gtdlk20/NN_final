We all ate them at the same time and consumed the same dosage (1/8 of an ounce).  The taste is something I have never enjoyed.  I was sitting on the floor and it hit me almost instantly faster than it usually does.  I felt drunk, swaying forward and backward, and began laughing along with J.  He was moving all over the room and talking which I found a little strange.  From my experience, I feel it is difficult to move because my whole body feels weak.  I try to refrain from speaking because I know that I dont make sense and feel stupid when I do.  This may be my own paranoia, though.  J was very entertaining to me for the rest of the night, and made me laugh a lot.  My abs are still sore.  Somehow, I felt comfortable tripping around these people so I talked a lot more.  We plugged in a movie, made ourselves comfortable, and watched it until it really kicked in.  Eventually we all got bored and the others decided to take a little journey through the backyard.  I was getting numerous phone calls so I decided to stay inside.  I was very surprised that I was able to hold a conversation with somebody sober.  This is something I have not been able to do in my past shroom experiences.
