Whilst the opening of the Younger Brother album 'A Flock of Beeps' played I went into a daydream-like reverie in which I imagined myself as part of an expedition in a snowstorm, which was attacked by bear, and someone was bleeding to death. Blood lapped up over my field of vision, and the sense of this was so strong I had to check to see if I really was bleeding and hadn't noticed, or even if I had pissed myself and become highly confused. This whole passage of the trip was tinged with deja vu, so much so that I thought I had experienced the exact same thing whilst listening to that album before, but I've since realised I hadn't.
