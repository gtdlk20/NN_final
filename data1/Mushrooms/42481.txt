I lay there for 1, maybe 2, hours, my mind just going on this trip. It was like a dream, and it was neither pleasant nor unpleasant. I really, really just wanted to sleep. But I wasn't, so I turned my light back on and decdided to watch more of The Office (brings me to a comfortable reality, as I've seen the episodes many, many times, and it is very down to earth). Recalling this experience definitely brings back the essense as I've already said, and it's strange. I should clarify that I'm only typing what I really do remember doing, but I know I perceived much more than I recall.
