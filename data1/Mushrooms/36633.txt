I finally got Guido to talk. He looks back at me and I relize hes been so silent because hes been crying. We start talking quielty about life and how we live it and if there is a God at all. Instead of walking right to get home, we walk left to go down to the beach. I find walking on the dirt on the side of the pavement is more enjoyable than the pavement itself, and Guido agrees too. And as we walk in the dirt in an unusually warm Novemeber night, we agree that the world is made of fools living off foolish things like money. Slowly, we mangaed to decontruct society and relize its all a sham. By the time we make it to the beach, we can either go left were all the houses are, or to the right where no one goes. We go right, and find heaven.
