The world seemed to be 2-D, like I could just step out of it and into the 3-D world, but I had to find the 3-D world first. Then a paranoid feeling came over me that I was solidifying. Everything seemed to solidify. I needed to keep up with the solidification because 'they' were going to catch me in my unusual, 3-D, unsolidified world. I talked myself out of this nonsense, or else it might have ruined the trip. I remember glancing in the mirror and my pupils looked square. I looked closer and they were still square. I would have looked at my cousins eyes to see if they were square, but she seemed to be in a very angry mood and I didn't want to deal with that. I'm sure my pupils weren't actually square, I really don't think they even dialated (I'm prone to dialation).
