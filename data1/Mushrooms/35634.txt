I tried to sleep, after I got off the phone.  I was not able to and so I sat trying to ascertain why I was feeling the way I was feeling.  I was still hallucinating, but my fractured vision had subsided.  I began to hear music in my head.  It was Oakenfold-esque trance music.  I interested me initially but grew repetitive.  I thought that it would be nice if the song had a new sound added to it.  Instantly, the music in my head readjusted itself with the noise I had wished it to have.  I slowly realized that I could control the music.  It was like having turn tables in my head, where I could create my own soundtrack.  The idea crossed my mind that DJ's are really the last pure reporters on the planet.  They inhabit key central nodes in the world-- New York, London, L.A., Paris, Sydney, etc.  They take music, which is essentially distilled information and re-channel it in a new direction.
