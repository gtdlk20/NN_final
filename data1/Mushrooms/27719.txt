I've concluded, even from my limited experience, that hallucinogenic substances do not 'do' anything to you, other than facilitate the opening of a gate to the wider world around us.  It depends on each individual how far beyond the gate they will explore and how much they will bring back when the gate creeps shut again.  I also think it's possible to wedge the gate open a little, in order to draw on an expanded perspective in our everyday lives.
