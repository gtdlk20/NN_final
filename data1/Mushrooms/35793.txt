I was totally blissed out.  Simply sucking in the vibrant energies of the green jungle I was immersed in, I could think of nothing else.  Making eye contact with the cheerful little lizards and geckos, and occasionally watching a boa constrictor lazily swim across the walls, were all that concerned me.  Therefore I blissfully, but wrongly, answered her question.  With a sigh and a warm smile I said, 'Nothing..'  I may have only imagined it, but it seemed to me that a slightly mollified look came over her face at this.  Perhaps I made her fear that she was slipping into the void!  Considering the strange and wonderful thoughts that wandered into my head during the trip, I don't think it too unlikely.  Whether purposefully or not, I did not pay much attention to Y thereafter.  She seemed to have an anxiety that was very, very slowly rising.  I remember that once or perhaps twice, she quickly glanced at something on the edge of her vision.  She did not look pleased at what she saw.
