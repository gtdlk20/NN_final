At this point, I began to explore my body; It looked the same, but when I ran my fingers across my stomach, or knees, or face, what I felt was utter alieness, something entirely new.  That feeling you get; that link between your nerves in your fingers and whatever part of you you're touching, was completely gone.  When I touched my neck, shoulder, or side, I was completely unaware of its connection to the very hand I touched it with, for this I could no longer feel. Perhaps the oddest, yet most intriguing part of it all was when I closed my eyes and thought; My thought processes were completely altered.  Every thought that came into my mind seemed to be part of a swirling, multi-faceted plain of design and information continuously playing itself out inside my head; and for some reason, I could entertain no single thought for more than a fleeting instant.  Then it would get sucked back into the afore mentioned swirl pattern (see fig, 1), never to be seen again.  I can only speculate that the reason I could entertain no singular thought for very long was that my head was teeming with voices, speaking in many tongues, saying fractured, fragmented things.
