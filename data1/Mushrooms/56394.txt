It was 5:00 and we were ready to trip, we brought along a couple other friends ill call them Goober and Datsun. We each took 1.5 grams and soaked them in warm water and drank the tea, and ate the other half raw. Within about 15 minutes the effects were coming on. I felt like my heart was being pulled down and I had a little bit of vertigo. I asked Goober how he was doing and he replied with a wide eyed smile. Everyone else was inside Seattle's house playing X-box, me and Goober were outside having a Djarum.
