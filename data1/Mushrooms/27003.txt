My first trip in the park wasnt bad as a matter of fact it was a lot of fun, but I had only taken about half of the intended dose, I would say around 2g, at the recommendation of my friends father. The effect was miniscule. I felt a very nice body high and I noticed a definite difference in my perception. It was very positive but there was no serious deviation from my standard reality. But I was thinking good thoughts and feeling energetic and positive. No visuals or anything, just an inflated self esteem and a large need for water.
