Driving on any kind of drug is not recommended. However, I could not sit still any longer; I had to explore. The road I decided to take was a curvy, mountainous one. It felt as if I was on a rollercoaster. The only reason why I decided to drive was because I still had mental clarity and the only visuals I had were closed eye visuals. As I was driving around, I smoked my second bowl. Before I went home, I stopped at the grocery store to pick up supplies for my dinner. One of my friends was my cashier. She was surprised to see me out while on shrooms.
