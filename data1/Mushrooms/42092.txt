And so they brought me lessons that came first in the form of wordless motion and ineffable energy that came with every step and every beat. I can not place into words these lessons truly for they have no words, but they are things I have been taught before in previous, less obvious lessons. Only now, however, did I feel the origin of these lessons. This felt to last for a lifetime, and eventually it evolved into a realm of self-reflective observation as the gathering and their dances slowly faded into a landscape of ice and wind. The music calmed to accompany. I was in an endless tundra, and I was a god of winter, part polar bear, part wind. I glided through the blizzard gracefully, alone and pensive in my cold solitude. It is important to note that the room within which we sat was immensely warm, with a gas fire having been on for at least an hour. However, I was utterly freezing at this point, on the edge of shivering. Yet the cold was so very comforting to me. I thrived on it, it was my source of life. It was my calling, I was the night, I was the winter.
