5.	I roll off the bed because I am now getting very scared, the room is no longer there, time is nothing and I am dissolving into pure God consciousness, At this point I am experiencing an absolute transcendence of consciousness, I am on the ground just wanting this to end because it is too much, I look at my phone and it is only 11:11 I stop the music and just lay on the ground helpless, it feels like a million years goes by and I look at my phone again still 11:11 I began to cry because time was not moving and I was stuck here forever.
