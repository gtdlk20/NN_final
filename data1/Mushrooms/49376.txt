I woke up the next morning really early, like 9. I usually don't get up till after 1 or 2. When I woke up that early I didn't want a cigarette and I didn't want to lay there or go back to sleep, I got up and worked out, then left to go find a job. Now it's a few days later, I still don't want a cigarette, I have no piercings, and I feel really positive about everything and everyone. I have now been doing a lot of research on the religions that use mushrooms in their practices. I had a very good experience and feel I have changed for the better, even my parents said I have been acting better since that night, they don't know why, but I do. I am looking forward to having another experience in a week or two.
