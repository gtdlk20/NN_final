After listening to those 5 tracks, one of my buddies was starting to feel overwhelmed and wanted to avoid getting sucked in to the trippyness. Everyone else was enjoying it, and had no problem, but it seemed like it was too much for him. I think everyone got much much higher than anticipated. We had to turn off the music, and the visualizer, and then he turned on the lights. He wanted to keep in touch with reality, at least a little bit. I call this the anchor that sort of keeps your sanity safe. But I've learned over my experiences with psychedelics that fighting to do that will only hinder the trip, and it's much better to lose yourself. Anyways, he was getting concerned and wanted to basically abort his trip. One of our friends that came with him was also starting to get a little concerned because if that kid thought it was too intense, then it must be as he usually keeps his cool when it comes to drugs and all that. However, I felt that we had a long night ahead of us, and we should just relax and watch a movie or something. The kids who were concerned disagreed, and thought that we should just leave the lights on (which bothered me, as it was much too bright, even when you're sober that light is too bright for the room) and I could also see pictures of my family all around the room, which I do not like to see when I'm tripping. But oh well, I just had to face the other way.
