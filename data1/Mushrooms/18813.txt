I strongly realised that every person must take care about the words they use. No one should offend anyone. Words can make people enemies. Enemies are only people that cannot understand each other.  I realised that this leads to WAR. I started to cry. The love feeling was overwhelming, so at this time I was unable to understand why people were killing each other. For money ? For food ? For petrol ? If they knew which words to use, people who need something can get it from people who have more. And people who have a lot and want to steal from the ones who have less are devils. I also realised that everyone should learn from other cultures, otherwise we won't be able to understand people who live differently, and then it could be the root of misunderstandings, and it might lead to war.
