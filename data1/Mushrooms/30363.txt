We went inside and went straight to the back for a Coke Zero. We got in line and it was kinda busy in there, so we were smacked in between this Hispanic family in front of us and an entire line of people behind us. I had to be cool. I had to keep calm, no crazy laughter or faces. Oh my god the kid in front of me has most of his head shaved except for the back??? How am I not supposed to laugh at that? I start cracking a grin but its crooked because Im trying to hide my delight at what the Universe has just shown me. They FINALLY leave and I laugh a little more before hiding it again and putting my coke on the counter. Get that lighter,  I muttered as I pointed at the Bic lighters. I make eye contact with the lady behind the counter, doing her 3rd shift shit. Shes miserable and pissy. Im trying not to be too obvious but she knows. I shoot the shit with her, barely. I dont even know if all the words got out. Shes like have a good night YEP I replied as I grabbed my shit from her and walked off. Got out of that store and exploded with nervous laughter that cascaded into normal cackling. We reflected on the haircut and the entire experience with various Did you see that??? chirps and ran back up the hill and found the weed.
