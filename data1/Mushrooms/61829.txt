It was the summer of 2001. In the middle of July. I am 17 and I wanted to try mushrooms. I did not know I was getting into! Me and a few buddies were going to do mushrooms. They had already done mushrooms plenty of times and I wanted to try some with them. We were at the bus depot around 6:30. I ate 3 grams worth of dried up mushrooms, and we were just skateboarding around. After about half an hour I began feeling tired, so I sat down. I asked my friend Tyler when will I start seeing stuff. Then he pointed 2 a building in the alley way. Yhe building was about 25 meteors away and it started moving. I started laughing and then I looked @ the ground and it started rolling. Then I noticed tracers when i moved my fingers, and I was very ammused. Another half hour passed by and I started noticing I was getting all liquidy. I was wearing my green shirt @ the time, and I felt like I was a Ninja turtle. LoL.
