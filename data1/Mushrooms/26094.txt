At about midnight I was well over the peak of the experience, and was reflecting on my experience, and despite the scary start, I found it a trip well worth it having thought about alot of issues in my life and what to do with my future. I won't hesitate to take mushrooms again, but from now on I'm staying on the good side of the mushroom entities and treating the sacrament with more respect.
