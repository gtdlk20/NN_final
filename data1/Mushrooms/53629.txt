To this day I don't what to make of that event. I'd always had a hopeful curiousity about out-of-body experiences, perhaps this was merely some psychological manifestation of Freudian wish fulfillment. Or maybe it was actually my spirit floating around there. That would have been truly awesome, however unprovable, and I would take shrooms again in the hopes that I could recreate that experience.
