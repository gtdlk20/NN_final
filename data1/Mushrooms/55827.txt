I bought the shrooms at school the day I took them, I wasn't planning to take them until that weekend, so you could say I was unprepared, but educated, because I had been reading everything I could find about them, I had my friend 'N' come over to keep an eye on me so I didn't do anything stupid, I only meant to eat one gram but before I knew it they were all gone and I had eaten both grams.
