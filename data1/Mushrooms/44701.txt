I turned to watch the wallpaper (the texture of my walls), and when I stared at it, I saw a weird human/robotic figure dancing, turning around itself and spinning. I was amazed at the weird figure, made out of simply geometrics. This wasn't a 'real halluciation', it was more of a combination of different geometrics.
