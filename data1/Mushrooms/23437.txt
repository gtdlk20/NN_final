10:10 p.m. Im feeling pretty strange. I was surprised at how fast the shrooms were kicking in. I had a rather large meal before hand and thought I had at least forty-five minutes to prepare myself, but I guess the shrooms were on speed or something. I was playing some Gears and I just couldnt focus. My stomach was hurting and I had this very out of place feeling about myself. I step outside for some air.
