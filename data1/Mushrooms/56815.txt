Anyways, it was about 7 or 8 at night when we took them and we were heading over to my friend erics sisters house who was cool with shit.For the first hour or so we were just laughing hysterically for no apparent reason. Not long after the laughing died down we started getting into these very deep conversations about life and who we are. I had been in some pretty bad groups and done some pretty rotten things and they started to come out in my trip like I was viewing my life through someone els's prospective. I started crying very badly and couldn't explain why I was so sad.My friends finally got me to get a grip and let me know it was going to be alright. After all the crying and everything we got into some other talks about things, it was freaking me out though, when we were talking and analyzing shit it was almost as if I could feel what they were feeling just by looking into their eyes, I knew what my friend was thinking and he knew it too, we would be sitting there and we would meet eyes and we would both be like what? Because we were both reading each other but didnt want to admit it, it was very wierd.
