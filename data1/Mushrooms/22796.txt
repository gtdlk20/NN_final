We walked up a path and marveled at the surroundings which we were immersed in. The internal drive to explore this mysterious world, which I, and I believe everyone had as a young child, had returned. There were so many things we could do, every direction holding different adventures. As I reached a long path, I started sprinting as fast as my legs could possibly carry me. It felt absolutely amazing to run, I had this huge smile on my face, like a little child running in a game of tag. I felt super-alive and like Forest Gump running for the first time, but instead of breaking out of metal leg-casts, I was breaking out of my societally conditioned, rigid sense of self.
