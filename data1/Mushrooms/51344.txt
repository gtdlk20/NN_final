When we went inside, totally disoriented, Bob Marley was still on, since we hadnt turned off the stereo. As we sat down in the couch, I heard him singing Everythings gonna be allright and it sounded like he was lying to me, and really meant that I was gonna die or something. As he sang this for awhile, I got really mad at him for singing this bullshit, so I stumbled to the stereo to change the music. I have always hated Bob Marley since then. Anyway, I found a GOA CD somewhere and put in on. As soon as the music started, all nervousness and all bodily discomfort went away like touched from above or something. It felt truly extraordinary. From a state of nervousness and discomfort, to instant bliss. I just said WOW! to my self, thinking: Now I know how set & setting can affect you!! and stumbled back to the couch, but this time with a big smile on my face. I noticed that my friends also started to enjoy the mushrooms. By now, I knew that it had been at least one hour or so, even longer, but when I looked at my watch it was only 11:35! My perception of time was totally fucked up.
