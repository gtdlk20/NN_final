Coincidentally during this moment of opening up, although I was not aware of it till later, the cloudy skies had cleared up into a beautiful open blue sky with white clouds and bright sun. This rise in light certainly did its part to make the surroundings more beautiful in magnificent light and brighten our spirits with energy. At this point things started changing from our normal perception drastically, and weÂ’ve confirmed for the most part that our visions at the time were the same, as we were very connected from then on. The tall swamp pine trees, we noticed, started all moving and swaying around in a very animated dance like way. It was very precise and repetitive, and this greatly pleased my senses and added to the euphoria I was starting to feel.
