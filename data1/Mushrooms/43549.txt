Suddenly, I felt very uncomfortable. I had to distract myself somehow. My hands were tweaking and my arms felt tingly all over. I instinctually grabbed the drum and started slapping my hands down in a neurotically fast rhythm. This eased me but I simply couldn't stop drumming. I think it was closer to 7:00 PM now, and it was dark out. Suddenly, my whole body was tense and surged with the drumming. The fire was fully ablaze and Pete was nodding with drum beat. I wasn't fully tripping yet, but I was completely connected with drum. I could clearly imagine myself as boy coming of age in Africa, undergoing a powerful shaman ritual. I stopped drumming and immediately felt kinda sick to my stomach. Pete was laying on his side, obviously in some sort of stomach discomfort as well. He packed his ceremonial, wooden carved pipe with fresh marijuana, and handed it to me. I inhaled a larger hit than I ever had before in my life. The smoke billowed out and I was amazed that I didn't choke like I usually did from big hits. Pete and I were aware that the mushrooms were about to fully seize control of us, and we began chuckling when we realized the other three were still oblivious, still screwing around with the fire. It was John's first trip, but he was quiet, soft-spoken, and wise. He moved himself closer to Pete and myself and seemed to gain strength from our wicked, bonfire-lit smiles. We passed him the pipe and he took a baby hit from it.
