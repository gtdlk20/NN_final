This time, 4 of us were making the psychadelic journey.  There was me, and my friends B, J, and K.  We met at a coffee shop at about 2:00 PM and headed up to a large house in a rural, mountainous region nearby my home.  This house had just been sold by my OTHER friends, and was now occupied by about 4 of them playing video games, and little to no furniture or objects.
