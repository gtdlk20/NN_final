Although I felt somewhat cursed by this incredibly profound insight, I took solace in the fact that I could just simply be, without having to do anything. It felt very peaceful to let go. It was during this time that I lost whatever sense of social anxiety I might have had before. I no longer cared what my neighbors might think of me, or how they might react to my own actions. I felt confident, in fact, that if I maintained this energy of peace and acceptance, that we would naturally bond. Hearing some construction workers speak in a foreign language, I felt I could understand them regardless, since we both spoke a common language of the heart. There really is nothing to be afraid of! I laughed out loud. Even if our actions our futile, we can at least enjoy the ride together, I thought.
