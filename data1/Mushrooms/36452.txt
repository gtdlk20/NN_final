T+4hrs. A drunken friend bursts into the room, falling all over himself, and acting like an idiot, slamming himself against walls, which begins to upset me in the state I'm in. I begin to get very angered, and especially pissed at him, and I begin to yell at him to sit down and stop acting like a jackass. I have no problem with drinking, or people drinking except when people become violent or just plain stupid around me where I'm in a state where I find it difficult to deal with, such as shrooming.
