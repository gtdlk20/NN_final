We bought the mushrooms the day before and after a heavy dinner, we ate them in my friend's dorm room at about 6:30 and washed them down with orange juice (we each had a little less than an eighth of what supposedly were some really good booms).  After a half hour of watching the Simpsons, we went down to the basement to take bong hits in the boiler room.  I took 3 or 4 big hits of the chronic weed we had, and I was pretty stoned.
