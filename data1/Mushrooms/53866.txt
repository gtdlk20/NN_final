K had a bad headache because of her menses and a friend wrote her that Sprite and Advil might help, so I decided to walk to the nearest gas-station to get Sprite. She didnt want me to go but I insisted. Besides I really wanted to get out in the night air. Again I had starburst which made the night lights lovely. I made it to the gas-station and back without incident.
