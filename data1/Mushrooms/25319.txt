T-1:00--At this point I realize this is the hardest peaking I've ever experienced (except on DXM). I start to get worried as my nausea increases and things begin to look so fucked up I can't even imagine why they exist. I light my lighter and we stare at the flame for at least 5 minutes. It gives us a great sense of well-being and joy. We stare and the earth and feel grounded. We still have trouble looking at the sky. At one point I try and my eyes hurt (it's dusk); a little leaf-man is running around and cackling. When we look at water we feel like we're floating, or at least I do. So basically we discover the 4 basic elements. I have a sensation of being 'the first man on earth.' Everything is complicated to understand, and the question 'why' zooms thru my mind constantly.
