I sat back mumbled good and stayed quiet. The police told us wed have to pay for the mirror and then sent us on our way.  As I left BK I looked at Josh and Wayne and said That my friends, was a mushroom trip gone terribly, terribly wrong. I went home and lied in bed thinking about what had happened, my life, and everything else. The night made me realize I was going to spin out of control with the amount of drugs that Id be doing and made me realize school should be number 1. After that I slowed down and focused hard on school. It was intense, and I now love mushrooms.
