     To this day I'll never truely know if it was the smoking of the mushrooms that did him in or not, but I enjoyed the experience I had until the scene went sour.  But to this day I am haunted by the memories of that night, and the absolute horror that it went with.  I would not recommend smoking mushrooms to anyone with any mental illness, and no one should ever smoke mushrooms I they do not have tripping experience and aren't in touch with themselves and know their minds.  The term that comes to mind is self-actualization.
