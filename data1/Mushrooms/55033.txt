My body started feeling kinda heavy but relaxing and felt good. We were only in my small bedroom with a cd player. We were laughing at the stupidest things, I took a bunch of pictures with my phone and if they were pictures with our faces our pupils were huge and we had a wide smile, we looked like aliens. Time felt like forever, 5 minutes felt like an hour which was kinda nice.
