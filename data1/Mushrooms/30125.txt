 It did not take long to reach the Island of trees about half-way up the Mountain. We rested while standing, drinking water, peeing again.  Off to the  left of the trees was the power conduit, running up to the top to to supply the sky-tram for the tourists going up and down the other side.  It was sheathed in a metal pipe, raised above the surface on 4 foot A-frames that were bolted to the granite slope.  I expected the metal to be burning hot, but in the tree shaded area where we would cross, it was comfortable to the touch.   While it was obviously not intended to be crawled over or under, it was possible to do so:  Following LogosÂ’ lead, I climbed over, taking care to distinguish the stable from the unstable parts of the assemblage.
