So we ate these little dried shrooms by the fist-full, complaining about the flavor, yet digging our hands in for more wondering when we would feel high.  We took a walk in the mean time, and the shift in reality hit me suddenly around a half hour later in a grocery store, when I spilled my spare change all over some small children in line behind us.  I had no desire to buy anything.  We made our way to a park with our unwanted new possessions, and I felt, as the shadows of the trees stretched out across the grass, that the whole world was going dark and that I was missing something extremely vital to my well being.  This feeling did not ever leave.  My sister and I had quite the discussion over what it might be, and in retrospect I think it may have been my sanity.
