After a while Cathi called us asking us to come inside since they had no money for food. We said we would but after 10 minutes we hadnt moved so Cathi called us once again and we convinced them to come outside. At this point they asked for money so they could get chips. I thought why not and gave Tim 10 bucks to get them. Two seconds later I realised that I didnt wanna give them money for food I didnt want and so I tried to grab my money back. However Tim using his non-mushroom reflexes avoided my attempts to get the money and went inside to get the food.
