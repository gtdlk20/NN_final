Beauty = gratitude. But gratitude extended beyond this. I would stop often (after the bed/mask) to be in gratitude. And I realized to perceive beauty is a kind of act of gratitude - sensorial gratitude, perhaps? And I saw how much of my tension of late is the absolute absence of gratitude in my life. Phenomenologically, to be grateful is synonymous with beauty, patience, and fulfillment.
