The most disturbing burden I had throughout the night was seeing other people, especially people I didnt know.  We wanted to get away from everybody so we went to a place that fellow trippers in my area call mushroom mountain.  It isnt a mountain, but more of a big pile of dirt.  It had rained earlier that day, so it was very muddy.  We parked and all walked up the hill.  My distorted depth perception and vision was really kicking in now that we were outside.  We were walking together but it seemed like they were all very far from me.  I began to feel like I was in a movie, a play, or a painting.  I couldnt decide which one it was most like, more like a blend of the three.  It was dark outside and the sunset made an orange glow in the background.  I could see beings which I made out to be J, Z, M, and S walking in a straight line across the hill to the right of me.  They were moving very slowly with their heads down at least that is what my mind perceived.  I was very confused at this point because a second ago they were all right next to me.  I felt like something was controlling them and for some reason we were all about to be in trouble.  I do not know where this feeling came from.  Then I snapped out of it and they were all sucked back to where I was.  I had lost touch with reality again for a brief moment.
