I have feelings of preparation for blast off. Feelings of imminent take off. As if things are roiling and swirling readying to explode. This is liquid, it is happening in the sub linguistic zone. I am below sea level in the mind, gaining tension, coiling the spring, mixing the hot alchemical forces to the point of volcanic eruption. Liftoff is imminent.
