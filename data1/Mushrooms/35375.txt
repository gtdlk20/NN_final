Those two words became my mantra for the rest of the trip. The rest of that path was a magikal adventure. The weather had become more intense from strong winds and only added to the drama already going on in my head. I imagined that I could feel my DNA talking to my consciousness via the buzz-saw sound in my ears. That I was tapping into my human collective memories via my visions. That I was re-charging my cells from all the damage I had done over the years via walking and breathing heavy. I was filled with total joy and amazed at how high I was, yet actually enjoying mushrooms. I felt I had crossed a big hurdle and was proud.
