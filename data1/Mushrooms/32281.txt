One summer morning I got a text, 'Today, we trip'. We were quite dedicated about what we did. So, of course, that day I canceled all my plans, and took the day off from work. The night before we bought two bags of Psilocybe cubensis (dried) for about 40 dollars per 1/8. Yes, I know that's a lot, it's a monopoly here in Iowa. Both weighing 5.5 grams.
