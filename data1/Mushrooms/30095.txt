We doffed the ceremonial robes and set to work executing the psilocybin tea tek.  Putting 1-2 cups each of purified water on a low heat toward a boil, with an eighth each of the fresh lemon, zest, mint leaves and perhaps a centimeter each of crushed ginger root slices.  The acid in the lemon we believed would speed up the onset, while the other ingredients were added to mitigate stomach upset, as we did not intend to strain the mushroom, aware that this might invite bodily discomfort as an accepted part of the trip.  While the tea basis heated, we each shredded and chopped our pile of mushrooms as finely as possible.  I reserved 4.25 grams, while Logos took the remainder, about 5.5 grams.  When liquid and shrooms were both ready they were combined at the lowest possible simmer, stirred with the tea-bags for ~20 minutes, then decanted with all materia into two travel water bottles with lids.  We then hurried a short drive down the road to the mountain, before the brew might over-cool and lose potency.
