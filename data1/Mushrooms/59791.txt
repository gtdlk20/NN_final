It's probably been about an hour and a half now and I just took a hit off a pipe and I get cottonmouth like nothing else, I decide to move inside and grab a drink but a supervisor was right inside so I decided against it and start to move back to the trampoline, click, the door behind me reveals the supervisor. That's it, the jig is up we're done for. Talking ensues, a conversation I remember well, but what was actually said, I'm not sure of. Jargon, I know the word sniffer was used so I don't believe any of it. It seemed to last an eternity, me standing there two feet away, conciously becoming aware I'm slowly inching away. It took a lot of effort to stand and stay quiet and not laugh shrooming.
