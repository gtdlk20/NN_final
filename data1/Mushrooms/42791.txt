Ive lived in poverty practically my entire life, and growing up, I faced many difficulties that those from higher-class families will never even contemplate. And Im still a virgin. We might as well get it out of the way early on here and move along. That alone has really fucked with my mind, and Ive faced more discrimination than anyone will ever realize. Ive always been on my own. Im quite certain Ive lost my mind. But please dont confuse this simple presentation of facts as a rant or list of complaints. The past twenty two years of my life have made me into the person I am today. Ive always strongly believed that everything happens for a reason.
