The dose I took this one night was one teaspoon of dried mushrooms, about 3 mushrooms worth, a small dose I didn't expect to get many effects off.  Maybe the 'afterglow' type effect where everything glimmers and tastes good, looks good, sounds good, etc., but not too much else.  My friend and I decided to experiment to see how few mushrooms it took for the trip to start.  I had not taken mushrooms for around 10 months prior to this experience.  I was not in a depressed or stressed state of mind, or state of life.  I was not suffering from any mental illness or bad emotional situation that might contribute to a 'bad trip'.  I was 'healthy' in every way.  I had had a good diet, and didn't even smoke pot.  I had even quit smoking.  I drank coffee and alcohol at that stage, and took nothing else.
