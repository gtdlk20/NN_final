My OEV's became apparent.  The pattern on my sheets of small circles moved and wiggled individually sometimes, my arm kept getting suctioned in at random certain points as I staired at it in astonishment.  I always knew I'd like visuals, but this was pure eye candy, coated with the finest fruity flavor imaginable.  I loved chilling way away from reality.  Another thing I had wrote down, taking up a whole page, was 'My only quest in the 'reality' realm is to find THESE,' THESE being written on top of a nifty looking mushroom character 'And manipulate my own reality.'
