Later on in the day I was standing on the slanted part of the floor (I told you this was significant) I was standing there facing the slope, and as I stood there I felt as if I was falling backwards, but then I noticed that I felt too weak and I was slowly walking backwards. Gravity seemed to be forcing me down the small incline. I found this to be absolutely hysterical.
