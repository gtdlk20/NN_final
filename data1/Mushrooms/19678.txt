It was at this point that I lost my ability to use my mind entirely.  For the next series of events I am forced to rely on the anecdotes of my friends who were sitting nearby.  Throughout this episode I had been sitting in a seat with my face in my lap.  My body gave way, and I drifted, face first, toward the row of seats in front of me, landing on a young couple listening to the music (which by this time had started up again).  Two of my friends picked me up off the ground and sat me back in my chair.  The friend who I had the strongest relationship with kneeled in front of me and began asking me questions.  He quickly realized that I was incapable of speech, so he grabbed my hand and began to lead me out of the crowd.  I blindly followed, thinking that he would probably take me to seek medical attention.
