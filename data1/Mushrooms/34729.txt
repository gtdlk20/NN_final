It was about the same time that I started smoking pot regularly that I began to hear friends talk about tripping on mushrooms. I soon started researching and have read just about everything I could find about the experience. It all intrigued me and for over a year I tried to get the combination of the right time and the right place and physically having the mushrooms. Finally, last week my best friend since before high school (we're 20 now) got his hands on a quarter of the fungus. We were to eat them on Friday night in the basement of his parentÂ’s house, the site of many of our high school drunken nights, a place where we could be somewhat loud or rowdy and be undisturbed while at the same time not disturbing his sleeping parents.
