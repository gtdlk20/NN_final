Then once my brother arrived it was too late for him to cheer me up and get me back to feeling good. He kept on asking me all these questions and it kept on pissing me off cause I couldn't answer any of his useless shit. I tried to have fun but I couldn't it was just too hard so I started to worry even more. I started to feel that I wanted things that were not even there. I didn't know what I wanted. One second I would want this person to be here then I would want the next person to be there. I couldn't control it. So my brother took me inside of taco bell into the bathroom so I could see what I looked like and see what was going on with my eyes. My pupils were huge and everything seemed stary. I looked at my hand it was changing the colors of the rainbow. That didn't really scar me too much it kinda calmed me down.
