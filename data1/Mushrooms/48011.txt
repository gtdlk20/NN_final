We went to J's house which we knew would be empty for the whole day. We had invited three friends round who were supposed to be getting drunk. We sat and waited for the friends to arrive which served to heighten our anticipation. Eventually the friends arrived and we began eating the truffles. From what we had read 10-15g was a standard dose, we decided to go with the whole 30g. The taste was foul, it left an unbearable sour/bitter after taste on the sides of the tongue. Eventually we managed to stomach the truffles and waited with our friends for the effects to kick in.
