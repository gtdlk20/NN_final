It's difficult now to remember what happened the next half-hour.  We had decided beforehand to go to an area of the river where there was a stone beach and some boulders and rapids to wade across.  When we got there, there were some families in the water, and we just didn't feel good about it as a setting.  We decided after some confused looking around to go up the river to another place, where there were fewer people, but more rocks and ledges to jump off of into the river.  I was a leery about having all that dangerous terrain to deal with, but we had little choice.  The spot was a ten minute walk, and the skin on my legs was starting to feel that creepy crawly feeling I get at the beginning of trips.  I practically ran leading everyone to the new spot through the woods, it felt like a race against my mind to get there before I got too high to find my way.
