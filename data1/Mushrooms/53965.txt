I was just over the peak when my dad told us that it was dinner time. I went downstairs hoping that my parents wouldn't notice my extremely dilated pupils.  I managed somehow, though still tripping, to converse normally with my parents while pretending to read the newspaper.   I actually spent the next hour talking to my parents, for some reason it was comfortable at the time.  Soon the effects were gone.  Before I went to sleep I smoked another bowl which brought the effects back to some degree and was rather unpleasant.
