Unrelated but still interesting: Whenever I eat apples on LSD they always cause me a very unique mindfuck of their own, and I have even philosophised the concepts of Adam and EveÂ’s garden of Eden was just a blissful nirvana of ignorance, chaos had not yet ensued until they had strayed away from their instincts and had hit on the world of experimentation that thus exposed them to a taught ego and thus the tree of knowledge, created sin. As sin makes us aware of existence and thus we question the fragments of reality rather then let our instincts justify it for us. I believe there is a lot of worldly understandings to be found within the depths of our own instincts, and only through understanding the inner workings of our bodies are we able to understand the world externally.
