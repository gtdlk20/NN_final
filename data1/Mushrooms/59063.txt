At one point in my peak, I sat on the floor in front of Lisa and we sat with our legs out and feet evenly together. She was dazing into the floor, I called her name to show her something cool but she didn't look up. I must have said her name like 5 or 6 times until she looked up at me. When I finally got her attention she rotated her head slowly upwards at me and said 'huuuuuuh' in a groggy type voice. When she gazed up at me I saw her lip slide off her face and hit the ground. Casey had warned me earlier about people faces twitching and moving when they weren't supposed to, so I found this to be the coolest thing I had ever seen. And then as I stared at her face for a while it seemed as if the skin around her chin and neck was melting. It wasn't like something in a movie, it just seemed as if it was trying to crawl off her neck. I bugged out with hyperactive energy and tried to explain to her what I was seeing. She was lying on her side laughing so hard at what I was telling her; needless to say I was laughing my ass off as I tried to tell her about it. This little bug out session was so intense yet it didnÂ’t last long. My attention span was getting mighty short. So we wondered out into the vast mall.
