My very first time doing shrooms was on a bus to Baltimore.  I had 3g of shrooms in my bag, and we decided to just see what it was like.  So we each kept popping little bits of it.  It felt like smoking very good weed; nice, mellow, total-body high.  Very cool.  I remember feeling very relaxed and introspective, and seeing mild hallucinations, mostly involving blurring of color and light.  I liked the experience, and decided the next time I did shrooms, instead of taking around 1.5grams, which my experienced friends suggested, that I'd take an entire 1/8th bag.  And I did.  I blended in with orange juice, and around 45min. later I was tripping.
