T:1:20 - 'I have to fucking get out of here.'  I tell my friend he can go get his pipe from his dorm and I'll drive him back.  As soon as we leave the house I tell him I just said that so that I could go back to my room since I was freaking out there.  He says that's fine.  I drop him off and start driving.  I completely forget what I'm doing.  I just know I'm on a road, in a car, with four problems in my head.  I can no longer even acknowledge that a drug is in my system.  I think my final I haven't studied for tomorrow will literally RUIN my life.  I think my roomate will never speak to me again.  I think I'll have to get a shitty job to get more money, etc.  I come to the conclusion I have to die.  That's the only way to avoid these upcoming horrendous events.
