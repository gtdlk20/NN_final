The overworld was even more disorienting. Once again, I have no idea when any of this happened. My body would thrash around automatically beyond my conscious control while I was in the overworld, and at some point I managed to remove my shirt and kick over a large bucket of dry cat food. The entire overworld experience was marred with a striking paranoia that I had either sat in dog shit or vomited. Each time I faded back into reality, I wasn't sure whether or not I had actually done either of those things and I would manage to ask one of my friends in broken English. When they confirmed that neither had happened, I was stricken with waves of euphoria and relief before falling into unconsciousness again. I attempted controlled movement when I was awake but my body literally felt like It was made of liquid and I would quickly collapse
