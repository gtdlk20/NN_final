M and I made our way to the bottom of the street (R lives in a gated community) and just walked around for a little bit. Suddenly a rent-a-cop came around the street. I told M to act like we went outside to smoke a cigarette. The cop shined his flashlight on us and then drove away. M was angered because the flashlight but I was too busy staring at the neighbor's house because it looked like some Polynesian tiki mansion to me. M informed me that he was going to a bad place so we went back to my car. The inside of my car seemed like a place of comfort for I have probably spent weeks in total driving time in that piece of junk.
