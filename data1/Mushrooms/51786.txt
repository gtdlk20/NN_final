Well,this being something i've experienced quite a few times ,the effects are generally the same.A mild cerebral high,similar to a toke or two off of some commercial grade bud.slightly more intense body sensations than the same...usually accompanied by some nice colored visuals....lasting 30 mins. to 1 hour....don't waste the caps or stems...use the shake and any dust in the bottom of the bag.
