About 45 minutes after ingestion things started getting stranger. We decided to go outside and take a walk. By this time the affects were definitely kicking in. I remember leaving the house and turning onto a street, and it seemed as if I could see everything. My words were slightly slurred and I had difficulty saying anything half way meaningful. The three of us randomly continued walking, taking turns here and there, not really paying attention to where we were going and why.
