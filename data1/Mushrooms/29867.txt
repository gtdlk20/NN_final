Ego dissolved; borders and boundaries dissolved into what I considered godless, galactic and even universal beauty. The universe made conscious and I could see how some would say this is heaven or even this is the mind of god. But it is not. This is the mushroom. This is the mind of a mushroom and the entire church and Christianity is nothing more than a mushroom cult. I thought how funny, for me, one who does not believe in anything remotely religious, experiencing the mind of god through the mushroom.
