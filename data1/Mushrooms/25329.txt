T-4:30--We listened to music, I discovered I was hungry and ate an apple. The music sounded fantastic. We took notes on our expeirence, which is what I'm writting this from (hey, we're psych nerds). Then something REALLY weird happened. We were looking at each other and then started to say the exact same things for a really long time it went something like 'Dude. No way! Woah. Stop. Hehehe! No seriously, stop.' exactly at the right intervals we jinxed for about 20 seconds. And I can safely say that after that, my skin felt normal, my mouth went back into place, and my arms existed again.
