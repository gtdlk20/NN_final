I watched some people play guitar hero but at that point I begged to be driven home by my friend. We finally left and I have a video of myself in the car of us stopped to let a train go by with me yelling for him to stop the car or we will hit the train (we're at a complete stand still). Sifting through my iPod was useless as it was covered in red and green neon dots, obscuring the titles. My friend turned into a demonic shadow, but soon I was dropped off at my house around 3:30 a.m.
