I have been smoking marijuana for nearly a year now, and while I love it I've always been intrigued by other drugs, more specifically psychedelic drugs like mushrooms, LSD, etc. Unfortunately it is rather hard for me to come by things like this...they're a rather precious commodity where I live. However a friend of mine recently said he could get me some magic mushrooms, so I readily accepted. The cost was 30 dollars for an eighth which was expensive for me, but I went ahead an bought a quarter anyhow.
