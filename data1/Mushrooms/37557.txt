Anyway, we played some videogames, but about half an hour into them, we began to feel anxious. I set down my controller and looked at a cord hanging down from light on the ceiling... it looked different, but I couldnt quite put my finger on the change. I explored a few other objects near me, and noticed that they too appeared to be different. The walls began to 'breathe' and we decided to go for a walk, but took some vitamin C pills before we set out. By this time I could definitely feel something brewing inside of me, so we walked around my neighborhood, waiting for the trip to fully take affect.
