Now, Syph was kind of weird looking, but he had once been called one of the 10 sexiest guys in America on some newsgroup poll, so it wasn't a bad weird.  But now, he just looked very Neatheral-ish.  I told him so, but not in a bad way.  Everyone laughed, we had a group laugh, prompting another look from the girl.  It startled us to remember she was there.   'Oh, I forgot she was there,' said Syph.  I said, 'Oh, I saw her before.'  'We all saw her before,' said Clock, 'we just forgot.'  Indeed , we had completely forgotten.  I looked down at Dummer, who was a smallish figure sprawed on the rock 50 yards downriver.  I stared at him, and tried to make the rock swallow him.  Not out of malice, but just because it was fun to do.  It began to bubble up around him, and seemed to vaporize at the edges and begin to waft over him like a cloudy lens or a slight gray fog.  Then, he and the rock turned into sharp shapes, and degenerated into a paint-by numbers, with Dummer just a few tan slivers in the whole gray jumble of the rocks.
