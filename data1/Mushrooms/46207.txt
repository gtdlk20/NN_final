My first truffle experience was at 19 years old, in a close group of friends aged 16-27. We took a boat out to the Scottish island of Arran to stay in our friend's family house while his parents were on summer holiday. We took them in the morning, on nearly empty stomachs. Everyone else had tried them before and were very certain that the best way to get a good effect was to not eat beforehand, to hold them under the tongue for as long as possible and then munch them down.
