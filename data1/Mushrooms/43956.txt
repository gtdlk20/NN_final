As I vomited into the toilet it began to transform into this dark hole as it had also done on the previous trip. I returned to my room and lay down on my bed again. At some point during the trip I began to feel as if I was being possessed by a being who, if theyd ever been a human person, would have probably been a warlord or tribal leader of some sort. I felt this aggressive confidence swinging through me and I began to reassess who I could be in life. This mindset receded relatively quickly and around this point I was sort of wondering if maybe Id reached the peak of the trip. Perhaps this would be a disappointing experience compared to what I had expected. Boy, was I wrong...
