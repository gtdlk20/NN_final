The pain started to increase and I was just drooling all over the floor and I wanted to kill the buzz I was having and just get back to real life. I wanted to kill the buzz I was having and just get back to real life. After I guess 5 hrs or so, I started to calm down a bit. A kept on telling me not to worry and that everything was ok its just a drug and we're going back to real life. I knew I had got into a bad trip and that I have to get out of it by any other way. I felt that the room was really small and uncomfortable, thats why I'm never going to do shrooms and sit indoors. Later on, I was starting to feel physically better; yet my brain was doing so much thinking and I was saying some weird stuff on how this world seems so strange, why are we here? I started to feel more connected to God and felt that he was really the most powerful.
