Her face was twisting in front of me and her pupils became slitted. They both looked so disgusting to me, they could not be my real family members. I believed she was a demon, mocking me of my drug use from my past life. I then lost all control. I stood up and went to the mirror, screaming at my own distorted reflection. I cleared everything off the dresser and the shelves. I pushed the computer onto the ground and threw my furniture. I never, ever have lashed out like this. I remember bits and pieces of it, but according to my family it was the worst psychotic fit they had ever witnessed. I ripped down my dress, yelling that I looked like a whore. I saw a police officer walk almost robotically up my stairs. I felt that he too was a monster sent to torment me. I knew him from somewhere, but I couldn't place where (he turned out to fill in for the officer at my high school from time to time) and I was forcibly handcuffed on the ground. I remember the pain I felt of being overpowered and man handled by these 'monsters' and believing it could only worsen.
