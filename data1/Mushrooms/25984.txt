I decided to go outside as it was a beautiful sunny day and the flat had a small patio garden, with some lovely bright flowers and bushes. I took my music and art books outside, and by this time I was definitely tripping, so I told my friends who had taken their Stones a while after me. I lost the anxious feeling around this time, and as my visual perception changed further I really started to think that I was in for a good time. I was feeling happy, if a tiny bit apprehensive. I tried looking at my art books, but soon found that I was unable to concentrate on them because thoughts were flying through my mind at a greatly increased rate and I would get distracted by anything and everything. My minds sensory filters had lowered their defences. I then listened to two of my favourite songs, and despite many lapses of concentration I was amazed to hear the music in a way that I have never heard it before. It sounded more emotional, more real and apparent, and I could pick out bits of music (certain small, quiet guitar riffs) that I had never heard before.
