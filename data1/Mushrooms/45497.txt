We walked around for a bit and I really started to feel high. I asked J if he was feeling the same and he said yes. I then started to get this weird feeling like a piece of me was missing. It was really indescribable but I felt like I needed to be doing something to make me feel complete. I couldn't figure out what it was at all and J was experiencing the same thing. We decided to go inside because we were getting very anxious. K was not really feeling anything at all.
