I went and picked up my friend.  We went and gathered a bunch of mushrooms from our colony.  Probably about 20 grams of dry shrooms, and over 10 or so grams of fresh ones.  I drove to my friend Mikes house (nobody was home), and began to eat the fresh shrooms.  It was probably around 4:40pm or so. Nothing was in my stomach for around 24 hours, I weigh 140lbs, and I have a high metabolism.  I dipped them in ranch dressing (I cant stand the fucking taste), and in about 15 minutes I felt the nausea begin.  (I have eaten shrooms before, but I barely tripped).  I knew from my previous experience that once the nausea began, I would trip pretty soon.  About 20 minutes later, I was still outside, and the grass began to have a wavy, ocean effect.  The tree had odd looking vines on it.  I went inside my friends house and sat on the couch.  I had the feeling of my body tensing up.  Suddenly, for a split second, one side of the room seemed to move away from me.  I moved to another couch, and that is when my girlfriend called.  She called my cell phone many times, but I didnt answer it.  I went into my friends bathroom, took a piss, and stared at myself in the mirror for about 5 minutes, because my reflection looked odd.
