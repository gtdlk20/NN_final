I decided to sit back and calm down from all the tripping and talking we were doing. Then suddenly I felt that my stomach was in deep pain and my whole body was so fucking numb (as if I had been drinking 10 shots of tequila). In a funny manner I decided to ask A whether I had taken too many shrooms cuz I'm feeling really fucked up, he answered me back by saying 'Don't worry man, everything's cool, dont feel paranoid or else you'll get into a bad trip'. The word 'bad trip' gave me a sense of fear and I felt that maybe I ate too many shrooms, I was thinking like: 'shit, what've I done, I've never felt like this before, I hope this ends as fast as possible'. I thought about dying on shrooms and how bad that would be.
