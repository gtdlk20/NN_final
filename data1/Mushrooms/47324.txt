I decided then, going to the mirror would be trippy, so I went. Walking felt strange, as if my legs where moving on thin air and I was hovering. I arrived in the bathroom and looked into the mirror. My face began to shrink, I was getting older, my face was being covered in zits. Then it went back to normal. I closed my eyes and then I saw thousands of blue dots, showering down my vision, tickling my brain. I looked at the mirror again, then left. I went back to the computer and checked the time. It was now 11:43. Time had slowed down then sped up.
