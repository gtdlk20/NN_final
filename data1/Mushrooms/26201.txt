Out of any entheogen I have ever tried, psiloscin/psilocybin mushrooms have remained my favorite ever since my first experience with them. In my entire life, (also over this past year) I have orally ingested mushrooms 5 times, amounting to 3/8ths of an ounce. The first four times I tripped, I had 1/16th of an ounce each time. The fifth and last, however, was a full 1/8th of an ounce.
