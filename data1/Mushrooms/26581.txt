Well holy crap, I thought I was a mushroom pro, I thought I could've handled anything, but here I was having the worst trip of my life feeling absolutely isolated. I thought the forest would be a perfect place to trip, right in nature. However, this forest just seemed horrible. I tried talking but I just felt horrible. The forest was definitely bad vibes again, so I suggested we head back into town. As soon as I stood up, my mood did a complete 180. I was so happy to be leaving that I started laughing, and having very cool visuals.
