After around 40 mins I suddenly tipped over from a sitting position onto my side, and thatÂ’s when I realised the shrooms had kicked in. Much to my friends amusement I had lost nearly all control of my body, I sat and giggled insanely whilst unable to sit up straight. I was astounded at how suddenly the effects had come on, but at this early stage I wasnt experiencing any visuals, I just felt heavily drunk. At this time I was sitting on the floor of my bedroom, S and A were sat on the bed and W was sitting in my chair. They were all quite drunk. The next thing I remember is I was suddenly sitting on my bed and S and W were now on the floor. 30 minutes and passed and to this day I have absolutely no memory of that lost half hour.
