Eventually, took a borrowed marijuana pen and some ginger tea outside, and sat watching the sky, trees, walls. I observed that if I looked straight, I could see clearly, but if I let my eyes relax, things would get weird. I thought of how in search of a strong trip, I imposed a sort of value judgment - that a strong trip is a thing which visually overpowers, that takes you fully beyond, in the sense of the objective world melting away. Ive had LSD trips where patterns on the floor spiraled up to greet me in 3 dimensional space there is something childishly fun in walking through the objective-world-turned-into-an-amusement park by my acid trip, but Im not sure its particularly useful. But why the desire to see this kind of disruption of reality, when the objective world itself is so amazing and surprising itself (despite our ability to familiarize and adapt to it).
