Next thing I know, M's gf is talking to me, making sure I'm ok, and for some reason I just couldn't recognize her at the time, this was weird, I didn't even know it was her, I just assumed it was a cop talking to me, asking me how many times I've done shrooms (I thought it was because of my 'murderous rampage' but it was just cuz I was actin real fucked), and strangely I said a couple times, when it's been sooo much more than that. Remembering the voices yelling at me, everything I thought might've happened to me but didn't, I said 'where's my mom?, I wanna talk to her', and this must've been really fuckin weird for them to hear me say that (later I kinda explained myself though). I was asking everyone, what did I do?! And wondering why no one would answer me (no one knew what the hell I was talking about!). So, I heard someone say it's gonna be crazy to explain this to him in the morning (talkin bout me). Still making me think I did something really really bad and stupid. What was really goin on was nothing compared to what I thought was goin on. What was really goin on was nothing compared to what I thought was goin on. So eventually I came to my senses and realized I'm in M's appartment and everything's fine.
