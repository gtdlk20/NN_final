3pm I took 3g dry subs made into a tea with a ginger teabag. I had my set and setting nailed down. I was feeling in the best head space I'd been in for weeks, I'd spent the morning cleaning and tidying my room and balcony. My housemates were home but I told them I was going to spend some time in my room reading and meditating.
