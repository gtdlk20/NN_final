I was very fortunate that we had Adam and Jen there to act as our trip sitters (A term that I didnÂ’t even know at the time). I have no doubt things would have gone very badly had they not been there. I also should have tried the shrooms myself before giving them to newbies, they should have been more aware of what they were getting into.
