In a sudden rush of recklessness, I just took and chewed another 4.2 g of Psilocybe cubensis. The onset took me almost immediately. Oh, this is going to be exhausting. Was my first thought and again it went off for another three stage mushroom ride. I briefly considered throwing-up but decided to ride it out. I was not too agitated and uneasy but then I remembered my iPod that I had completely forgotten (I had thrown it in my backpack the very last second I left the apartment). So I turned it on for the first time in years and loved the familiar electro tunes, dancing to them in the kitchen, enjoying the sight of a misty early spring hill covered with dead trees and smiling at what would happen if anybody was seeing me there. Eventually, I went to bed and fell in a deep sleep. This last run was extremely exhausting, emotionally and in terms of thinking.
