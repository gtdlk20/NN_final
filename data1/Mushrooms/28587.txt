I'm fairly new to drugs, and I've found I'm partial to the psychadelics, although unfortunately I have a genetic 'condition' that makes me resistant to most drugs.  Typically it takes 2x as much to have exact same effect on me as an average person.  Well, the other night I got kind of cocky and my buddy had just sold me some chocolates that were laced with about 3.5-4g of shroom each.  I had taken 2 in the past and it was a good high, but I wanted to trip balls and see what it was like, so I popped three of them over about an hour or so.  That's somewhere between 10-12g of shrooms.  It was just me and my wife in the house, so I was set.
