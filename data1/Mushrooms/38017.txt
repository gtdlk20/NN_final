The next weekend we decided to try the light bulb, which we had previously used for vaporizing herb.  This was quite an efficient method, but since the vapor collected in the bulb and stagnated as we tried to suck it through a tube without gagging, it wasn't much of a pleaser.  On one occasion, my friend took too large of a rip and ended up vomiting during a coughing fit.  I don't recommend this at all.
