I ingested 2.5 grams, full weight-based dose for my 110 lbs, as per the guidelines from Johns Hopkins (20 mg/70 kg which equates to about 1/2 gram per 10 kg.) This batch is a known quantity and as a lightweight, I've had fairly intense experiences with 1.5 or 2 grams but wanted more. Drank at 10:30, then meditated for 15 minutes. I returned to the bedroom where Z was wrapping up his pre-trip guitar playing and we turned off all but the tiny purple christmas lights and I wrapped up in the fleece blankets, suddenly cold. My feet were cold, I was shivering, but I figured it was mostly pre-flight anxiety which is par for the course.
