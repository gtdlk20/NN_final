At this point the visual effects of the shrooms began to kick in. The interesting thing about mushrooms (at least this particular type) is that apart from some slight wobbling of lines hallucinations dont particually move. What is interesting though is the change in the texture of everything looks. Everything people, walls, animals looks like its made out of plasticine. If I didnt know I was tripping I would be sure that I could pull a chunk of wood off the wall and mould it into any shape I wanted.
