Later when I was coming down I went outside with my friend to smoke a cigarette.  It was night time and I couldn't remember the world ever being so beautiful.  I watched the trees, and the stars, and the sky, and mostly the moon.  I felt so connected with nature and people and the earth.  It was an extremely positive experience that I will never forget.
