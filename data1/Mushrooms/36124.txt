Yesterday was one of the most intense mushroom trips I've ever experienced in my lifetime. Two days before our trip we bought 4 grams of dried magic mushrooms. At first I was quite mad because I'm an experienced cosmonaut and what we got for the money we paid just seemed like too much of a rip-off, but after taking them and experiencing the effects of these little treasures we understood why we got so little. We didn't need much. Also being experienced with mushrooms, I know that anything under 4 grams is usually a mild trip; this simply wasn't so with these. I wish I knew what kind they were simply because I grow my own mushrooms and I would love to experiment with these. They were definately of the psilocybe genre, but I don't think they were cubensis, simply because they didn't look much like them. The stems (dried, mind you) were from 3 to 6 inces long, wide at the bottom and narrowing towards the cap. The cap itsself was fairly small, gills dark brown and the top being brown and tan with brown specks all over it.
