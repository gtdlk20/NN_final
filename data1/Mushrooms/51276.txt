We decided to take a cab back to our rooms so we started walking down the street. I was still a little hungry so I stopped at a roadside cookie shop. By then simple things like ordering food or especially paying for it seemed very foreign and complex. I could not really remember exactly what I had to do and I felt like the woman was sensing something was up and I got very self-conscious. I barely managed to pay for the cookies and we kept walking down the street looking for a cab. P and he went to his room and I went to mine. He was going to change clothes and come down to mine and was going to watch a movie.
