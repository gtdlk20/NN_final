This report might sound a little funny, as it is both the best experience that I've ever had, and it was on drugs at church camp.  In August of 2003, I was preparing to leave for a week-long church camp in the central Sawtooth Mountains in Idaho.  I really wanted to bring some pot with me, but for some reason nobody I knew had anything but mushrooms that had just come in from Seattle.  This was fine and dandy with me, since they are my drug of choice.
