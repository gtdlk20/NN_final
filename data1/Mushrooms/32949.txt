As quickly as it had come, although I never noticed it happening, all feelings of intensity and discomfort were gone and the trippiness of it all became the focus. We were smiling, laughing, and entering a very euphoric state, and the immensely pleasing visuals began to take form. Now, the assumption I have made is that every shroom trip experience takes you to a metaphysical gateway in the mind or spirit, a barrier of the psyche between the layer of reality we commonly experience, and this deeper one. So, the stronger the mushrooms, the thicker the barrier between the worlds, and the harder the push it is to break through it. Where I was as far as my social energy state during the first hour when Camille and I were tense and overexcited was stuck in between the barrier of both states of consciousness, or stuck between dimensions if you will. It seems we could only break through this time if we opened our minds to each other and went together, thus activating the true happy shroom trip and leaving the lower perception of reality completely.
