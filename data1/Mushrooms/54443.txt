One of the toughest factors in this trip was that there was no assistance, no help, no saviour.  Previously, I had encountered the likes of the Spiderwoman (the storyteller), the Architect (Vishvakarman), Shivam Ganesh, the Mother (Devi, Maria, the blue goddess, Namagiri), the Green Woman and so on.  Not this time.  I was really out on my own, having to fend for myself.  Drag myself out of the cold, hard mud and pull myself out of the sh*t.  But I did so here I still am.
