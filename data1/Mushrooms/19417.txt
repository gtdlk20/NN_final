I was in there for a good half an hour, indulging in multiple body sensations and really appreciating the warmth, cleaning out my lungs, stretching muscles, giving my body a full workout. A fair bit of yoga and I honestly felt like a Hindu in the shower, IÂ’ve never felt that attached to that religion before, but it took on a whole cultural experience, from the far reaches of India, A man was now indulging in western shower. I felt a strong cross spirituality.
