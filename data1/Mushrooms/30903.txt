By dusk I had returned to 80% normal and even felt that I could hold a rational conversation with common platitudes. I walked home to my cabin on the shore trying to collect the experience. I dont smoke cannabis, but I opened an IPA beer and sat outside looking at the snow-capped Wrangell Mountains and 9000 ft Devils Thumb, watching the tide come in, lapping around boulders on the beach. I felt at peace and have wanted this feeling of clarity and resolution for a long time. I felt at peace and have wanted this feeling of clarity and resolution for a long time.
