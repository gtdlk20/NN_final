Last April I happened to have the foresight to purchase some magic chocolates, I was no longer on interfering pharms, and it had been ages since my last cluster, 18 months, about six months longer than usual...  was told they contained a gram each of some psilocybe, can't remember the specific one.  Anyway I've been working on the assumption of 1 gram of p. cubensis per chocolate.
