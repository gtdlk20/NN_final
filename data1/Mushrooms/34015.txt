We finished the rest of the movie (T+2:00? I pretty much lost track of time at this point), and Ace met up with us at the front of the theater with tears still streaming down his face. He informed us that he wasn't actually crying, but that his eyes were just so overwhelmed with the pictures on the screen that they were watering heavily. We walked back out to the parking lot and got in the car where we all decided that it was still pretty early in the night and that we should find someplace else to go. I was still maintaining pretty well and was mostly just concerned about Ace's reaction to his first trip. We decided on going to grab some food for my sister and her friend and then going to a hookah bar nearby.
