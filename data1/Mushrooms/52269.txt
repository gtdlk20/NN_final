Then I started to see another strange hallucination.  I started seeing my friends say what they were about to say before they said it!  I was certain that I was seeing into the future.  I found myself knowing what was going to be said next!  At the time I was amazed, but I have since been led to believe that the effect was due to the two halves of my brain not communicating very well.  Dave, Carl and Norris decided they wanted to get something to eat.  I was in a position where I didnÂ’t want anything.  I was totally content, happy and enjoying myself.  I was no longer capable of really making rational choices; I was virtually at the peak of my trip.  I followed everyone out of the hotel, happy to do whatever.  Outside, the trip took on a different form.  Things were no longer so intense as in the room.
