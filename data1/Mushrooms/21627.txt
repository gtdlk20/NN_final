Dee began to panic. He was freaking out because he thought his couch was so expensive and he would have to explain what happened to his parents. Basically being in the hallucinogenic state he was in, he thought his life was going to end because of me peeing of his couch. The last thing I clearly remember was being thrown off of his couch. The next flash of a scene in my memory is me looking in the mirror shirtless and bleeding from my face with my chest covered in blood. I didnt know what was going on but I ironically thought my bleeding reflection looked like Jesus. The next flash I am outside and the sun is rising. I would later learn that Dee had punched me in the face because I was begging him to do it as he was freaking out about the couch stain. As the sun was rising I was sitting staring at the hedges in Dee backyard rapping one of my favorite Lil Wayne songs at the time, shirtless and bleeding. I looked at the hedges in his yard and they spelled out the worlds Ron Regan. This was because Ron Regan was a name sung in the song I was rapping. After a failed attempt to drive me to get me in the car to the hospital Dee told me to stay outside so I dont get blood anywhere and he could clean up the urine. I did not understand him and tried to walk through the door into his house but he got in my way and stopped me. All I could think was that I wanted to be inside so in an attempt to distract Dee, I threw my cell phone across his yard. I figured I wouldnt need it since I was currently dreaming. My distraction worked and he retrieved my phone and I went inside. Once he came in after me I remember getting an extremely odd feeling and I looked at the door to the room knowing something was about to happen to it. I stared at the door and like clockwork; his mom came through the door and looked at us and the scene that unfolded with a shocked expression.
