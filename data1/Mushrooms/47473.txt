P. started to feel some of the effects now and the two of us stared at the smoke rising above some insence we were burning.  J left for a smoke and the two of us followed him outside.  I could see ripples where J's feet landed and got the feeling we were walking on water.  There's this giant tree in their front yard and once we stepped outside it was like another world.  The tree turned into a pot nugget, thank God I didn't try to smoke it.  The sun was like waves all in all it was very cool stuff.  Once we went back inside however it was all different.
