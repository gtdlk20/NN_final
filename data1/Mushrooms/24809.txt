Then I would just have to put my head on the floor and the trip would have its way with me.  Those moments, which seemed to happen over and over again, did not have any visions or anything that can really be described.  Just a feeling of being overcome, and a whirring machine-like sound.  At one point during one of those, I remember recognizing that I was an organism lying on a floor, and I could feel my heartbeat and respiration.  I thought to myself that at least I know Im still alive.  I said to myself that my heart would keep beating and my lungs would keep breathingor would they?  A voice inside told me not to go there, so I shifted my focus elsewhere.
