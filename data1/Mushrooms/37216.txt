I felt refreshed by the beauty, what Nature had shown me made me cry in absolute joy to be alive to see what I had seen. I stayed awake the rest of the night and the following day contemplating what my experience meant, and waiting to see just how long the effects of the mushroom would manifest. I dropped them at 8 pm, and peaked around 4:30 am---this is an unusually long time, to my understanding, and it gave me a lot of time to think after everyone else around me went to sleep it off.
