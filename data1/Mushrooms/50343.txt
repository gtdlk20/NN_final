The most unpeculiar feelings came when we were back on site.  The grass was at first an eerie bright green and seemed to glow.  When I concentrated on its colour it turned yellow, and started coming closer to my face although I was standing upright.  At the time it was very funny.  I then started to really trip out.  A very trippy song came into my head that I cannot put a name to and I started to slip away from reality.  It was as if I was trying to discover reality but could not find it.  I became paranoid I would remain like this forever.  After a while I realised that I had not lost touch.  I began to believe that for the first time in my life I was using all of my brain.  I had become a higher lifeform.  I imagined energy flowing from my fingers in blue patterns.  I felt like a god.  I began to have extreme energy rushes. And the tune in my head became louder.
