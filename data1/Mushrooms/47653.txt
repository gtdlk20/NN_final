This is when things got bad, I started seeing things I didnÂ’t want to see and threw up some. Junebug fell down and caused some confusion, but L, L lost it, he fell and his nose started to bleed, he was convinced he had mushroom poisoning and began to shout and yell. It was time for me to go, far to many bad vibes in the house, I assured L he would be fine and drove home still lightly tripping.
