As I was walking, my anxiety grew even greater, as I couldn't tell myself where to go next, so I kept walking.  Every once in a while, I would stop and lie down, and tell myself to THINK, but all it would do is get me more anxious, growing to the point of fear.  This is one of the most unusual parts, because, after my own house, I consider the woods the place I am the most comfortable.  This is why I chose the forest as the setting for my trip.  I found my camp, and looking back, I did take a relatively direct route there. At any one time, I could tell you exactly where I was at the time. I could not, however, for the life of me, tell you where to go to get to my shelter.
