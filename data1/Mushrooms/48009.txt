We then decided to go back to the shop and purchase some higher dosages. The woman in the shop explained to us that they had three types of mushrooms: The first were the Thais which we had experienced earlier, the second were Hawaiians which she explained to be stronger and thus more expensive and finally they had truffles which she described to be thinky and somewhat poular. Our first choice would have been Hawaiians but we were not carrying enough money. In the end all three of us bought 30g of truffles each.
