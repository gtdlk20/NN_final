What haunted me briefly post trip was a realisation that the couple of times I felt I might die I had a willing acceptance of it. I continue to wonder if I really thought I might die and was truly accepting of the possibility or if underneath I knew I was, hence my acceptance feeling so easy, or if the whole emotional response related to ego death, or was a metaphor for something else entirely!
