People say 'War ? Yeah, this is terrible. But this is not my problem, I have already a lot of problems to deal with'. 'My' problem ? 'MY' ? What was this ? 'My' ? We are all brothers and sisters on Earth, because we all have the same parents, who were living thousands of years ago. We are all from the same family. I realised that problems like war are only family problems, raised to a breathtakingly scale. I started to understand clearly all those people dedicating their life to fight against war. Fight against war ? It was no-sense. You cannot fight to calm down people. This is the root of the problem. Every problem must be taken with non-violence. At this time I had a profound respect to Gandhi, who did a lot of great things without 'fighting'.
