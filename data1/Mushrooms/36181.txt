I knew full well that I had three pieces of coursework to be doing, but somewhere in the back of my mind I thought: 'You know what? That can all wait... there's something more important you need to do first!'. The important thing I had to do turned out to be ingesting around 3g of dried P. Cubensis. So at around mid-day, I did, and as usual it tasted like utter crap. This would turn out to be my fifth mushroom experience, and I felt very optimistic about it. That day just had a good vibe about it.
