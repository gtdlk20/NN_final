T +3:15 I return back downstairs and try to play the guitar.  The orders of the frets and notes have no meaning anymore and the guitar is out of tune.  This bothers me but I am unable to tune it so I stop playing.  I then watch footage of myself and E from earlier in the night and am surprised to see how intoxicated I appear.  I wonder if I am still acting that way, and assume I am.
