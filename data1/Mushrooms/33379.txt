Roughly ten minutes before we entered the forest, I ingested my half as well. Then, we arrived at our destination in a beautiful part of the forest, nearby a manmade waterfall. We approached a vacant table nearby the lake, that meets with the waterfall. I sat down shortly before I heard my love speak, 'I'm trying to sit down without the ground moving out from underneath me.' She then explained that the grass was moving, and shifting in a much sharper neon green color. I laughed with her because I knew that the drug had taken hold of her. After a little time of small chit-chat and flirting, we hiked up one of the nearby nature trails. It was here that my trip came upon me. I recall when I sat down at the base of a fallen tree, I told her that I was 'almost there'.
