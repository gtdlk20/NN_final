I reached the apex of the trip when I convinced myself that I was lost in my own house.  I was sure that my parents house looked nothing like it was at the time.  We moved from room to room, including closets and bathrooms, to make sure that we were still in the same location.  After a few hours, this uncertaintly disappeared, and we all felt a slight stomach discomfort.  A few hits of Cannabis cured us, and we relaxed on the couch until the other girl and her boyfriend left.  This left the two of us alone and we cuddled together on the couch feeling overwhelmed by what we had just experienced.
