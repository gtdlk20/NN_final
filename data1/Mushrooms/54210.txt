It got to the point where I started going into time loops and thought loops.  The clock did not seem to want to budge. Meanwhile, I was reassuring myself that I am ok, and I am here.  It was nice to have my arms wrapped around my chest, like a self hug, to comfort myself and know I am not alone, that I am here with myself (trust in a higher power, or just trust in general).
