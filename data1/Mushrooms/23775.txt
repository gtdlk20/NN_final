We decided we would just drive around and behold (another word we used) everything there was to see.  I felt as if I was in a boat, a racecar, and a spaceship and different points during the night.  It seemed as if the car was still, but everything around us was moving.  The street was moving very fast, and in layers.  The trees were overwhelming and were everywhere.  They were growing and moving abnormally.  I felt as if they were beings watching me and what I was doing.  The phrase they know kept repeating over and over in my head.  Everything seemed to blossom.  The others in the car were talking but I didnt pay attention or take the effort to try decipher what they were saying, because I knew it was pointless.  I just wanted to get lost in my own thoughts.  Everything around me was so overwhelming.  I had the feeling that there was so much going on around me and I couldnt absorb it all.  Everything I would behold for the rest of the night seemed to simply just make sense.  Everything made sense in a way I had never experienced before.  I felt like everything in the world was its own puzzle piece and all of the little pieces came together and fit perfectly.  Everything was everything.  Nothing was nothing.  Everything was the same.
