I was a bit unnerved by my toilet turning into a spider, but for the most part I could just think, 'Awesome!' I went back into the room and told T about it. I don't remember what he said. At this point we ran out into the kitchen and grabbed up a bottle of 500mg vitamin C tablets. I took 10 and T took 8 or 9. We ran back into the bedroom and Tony was lying on the bed saying something I couldn't understand. I was busy staring at the sticker on my door that had wavy lettering. It was moving around and I was mesmerized by it. T ran into the bathroom to look at the mirrors.
