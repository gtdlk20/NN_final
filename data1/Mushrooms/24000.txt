The night continued further along this general pattern: I spoke to A, smoked a couple of cigarettes (not as many as one might have thought considering the beauty of the outside world, had it been summer and warm I would probably have spent half my night on the windowsill, but mushrooms tend to make me feel chilled to the bone), relaxed in bed, gawked at the absurdly claymation-esque rugby players  who, in fairness, look quite deformed and lumpy at the best of times  and admired the patterns swirling about on the wall. At one point, as I was in the midst of an in-depth introspective look back at my own person, I happened to glance at the front cover of a book standing in my bookshelf. A thin, colourful film of some sort, probably originating from the same visual disturbance that was causing the upwards-moving cloud wall, was streaming up along the wall and across the book cover, causing the letters to bulge and bend in a very 70s-psychedelic-art-emulating fashion.
