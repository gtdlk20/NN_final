Soon things were starting to get out of hand, I was off on a tangent about the people we could see from my window, walking about and driving in their cars. I couldn't figure out what they were doing, it all seemed so ridiculous, that they were so busy with their strange little lives that they couldn't even perceive this chaotic maelstrom of a world that was raging right under their very noses. D started to get a bit wound up in my tangent and decided it was a good idea to go and confront a frail old lady that happened to be passing and ask her just what the hell she thought she was doing and whether she could spread some light onto just what the hell was going on right then. Naturally we had to restrain him, luckily we were still in a state enough to recognise that this probably wasn't a very good idea and try and convince D of this fact.
