I knew that I needed to barf, and I could just about figure out that I also needed to wee and poo also, but because I was so damn confused I ended up just standing there wondering what I should do. It was around this time that I started yawning, and by that I mean yawning absolutely uncontrollably - and each time I yawned my eyes would water. I kept thinking to myself: 'You need to piss, shit, puke, you can't see a damn thing, and you can't stop yawning - this is pointless so you may as well go back downstairs and lay down!!!' So I managed to get back downstairs, although it took me about 2 minutes. Luckily, none of my housemates saw me, although I had a couple close calls.
