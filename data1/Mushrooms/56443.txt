For the 4th of July four of my friends and I took 2 grams of mushies cultivated by myself.  After I dried the mushies I ground them in a coffee grinder and put them into chocolate. I mixed up a large amount of chocalate (50 grams mushies) and stored them in the fridge for six months and they never changed in potency.
