Barter fair is a newly found annual party I go to. ItÂ’s out in Tonasket, E WA (Okanogan). 1000's of people get together on this vast piece of property and set up vending booths to sell their product out of. 1000's more people come and camp out for the weekend on the other half of the property and everybody partys and makes money all weekend. It feels as if everybody is best friends with everybody and everybody has known everybody for years and everything is expressed openly and freely and authority doesn't interfere whatsoever. The unity of everybody's spirit, the friendships established every year, the energy, it's so intense.  And the partying can be related to a psychedelic experience all in it's own without the psychedelics.
