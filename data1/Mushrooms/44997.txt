I walked in and the whole apartment seemed to be made up of pastel colors, I shit you not. Everyones faces looked different and what ever emotional impression I had of them, it seemed to manifest into some visuals form. Everyones faces looked different and what ever emotional impression I had of them, it seemed to manifest into some visuals form. One was always emo and sad and her skin had a teal like hue to it. And she looked even sadder then usual One looked like a troll and her skin had a orange hue to it. One after finding out I was high, his skin turned red and his eyes lowered and he looked meaner than anything I had ever seen, he just didnt want me to act like an ass in public when we went out. The one who thought is was funny and didnt care looked like a wacky troll when he laughed and looked pretty funny actually. I was starting to relax since they knew now and the trip got nicer for me. Stuff on tv got a nice color boost with my visuals and the room looked a lot longer.  We all ate and went to the movies and saw Harold and Kumar 2 which isnt to bad on shrooms. I came down and had a few beers around 12:30.
