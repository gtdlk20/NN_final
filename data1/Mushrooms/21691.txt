Suddenly it felt like my body was spaghetti-I could walk and stand but I would swerve about like a drunk. I managed to get out of the tunnel to my friend who didn't smoke and was sort of keeping watch. Things then kicked into high gear. The first thing I noticed were rainbow halos around every light, which eventually transformed to look like lens flares, but with rainbow colored tendrils extending out from them. Soon I began seeing flashes of light everywhere, like lightning in a cloud, but in the sky, in trees, and in the grass. This was followed by visible tracers whenever I moved my head, short lasting and rainbow colored. Everything began to be accompanied by a lingering prismatic ghost image, making the world look blurred. It was then that my entire vision was paved with tessellated fractals, a grid overlaying everything I saw that was pulsating with color. my entire vision was paved with tessellated fractals, a grid overlaying everything I saw that was pulsating with color. This whole time the sky was shifting from a deep purple to a dull red. I began experiencing pareidolia, seeing faces on every mottled surface, mostly Aztec and Inuit art looking faces, but also some angry looking faces in the bark of trees. They too were tessellated and nestled into every surface. At this point the trees began doing surreal things. One row of trees looked like the exact same tree copied, pasted, and mirrored over and over again. Another tree had transformed into the shape of a perfectly symmetrical snowflake. Others were bending and rippling and pulsating. Any light source was now radiating rainbows. At this point the sky was now being crossed by flashing rainbow wires and the psychedelic grid was replaced with tessellated colorful animal faces, most notably, bears.
