After about 4 hours of tripping (real time, that is. It seemed like 10 hours to me) I was starting to come down. I wasnt getting as many visuals anymore, and while I still felt great, I wasnt laughing constantly anymore. Hank and I went back to Alexs place and smoked some weed in his van, which really brought back the shroom high for a while. Hank and I sat in his room watching old dubbed kung-fu movies. I was so tranquilized I couldnt move, but the visuals were definitely back. The screen really glowed bright, to the point where it was almost hurting my eyes. I leaned back and looked up at the ceiling. There were a thousand mouths, just lips and big toothy grins in rows floating across the ceiling.
