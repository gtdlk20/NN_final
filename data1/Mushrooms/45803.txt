11:55am  An unexpected call from my mother. I am estranged from her, so this really freaked me out.  At this point, my walls were beginning to warp and breathe a little, so I decided not to deal with this. My trip wasn't about my childhood. I've dealt with that pain many times while on mind-altering substances. I asked for her nurse, who thought I was my Aunt. We cleared up the mistake and I started meditating.
