I paniced.  I realized I had to get out of there.  I went to the bathroom.  All the people around me seemed to be staring at me and talking about me.  I finally got to my destination and I made a huge mistake.  I looked in the mirror.  My face scared me and I almost screamed.  I was deathly pale, and there were blotches of colors on my face. I don't know if my face really looked that way in real life or if it was just my twisted mind.  So I freaked and pulled out all of my makeup from my purse.  I was fumbling around trying to cover up my hideous face when the first human interaction commensed.
