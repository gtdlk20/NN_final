(+:30 min) We are all chilling out and I ask one of my friends how he is feeling. He replied with a half hearted grunt so I told him to come with me to look at the water running over the rocks. It was only about 20 yards away so I felt comfortable leaving the other two laying down with the music. My friend and I sat down and began to gaze at the water cascading over the rocks, liquifying almost everything that was in the path of the stream. I continued to tell my friend to just breath in and out and to let the mushrooms do what they need to do, not to fight it. At this point it was clear that something was beginning to happen because all of us starting giggling and walking around aimlessly, marveling at the wonders of trees, water, and sunlight. I could tell this was going to be a good trip because everyone had really good energy about being in nature and felt a good synergy with the surroundings.
