I have heard people on the internet talking about smoking mushrooms and one of my friends had told me of this.  One night I got out my bag of shrooms and collected all the small broken off peices and a few tiny caps and packed a bowl.  The effects were similar to weed exept some of the mental ones but it was a nice relaxing high.  I think eating them is better but if I only get like a small amount or just a bunch of broken little peices then I should smoke them
