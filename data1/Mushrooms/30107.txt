Perhaps 2 minutes after crossing the tracks, and coming out onto what seemed a vast plain of sloping granite, I realized my body was VERY HEAVY and that I was equally HOT under the direct glare of the Sun, with my heavy pack full of waters, and hat (usually quite light-weight) heating up my flushed head.  I had already opened one of my waters and was grateful no one was around, as I could tell I was having trouble moving ahead.  I fought a wave of nausea that dragged behind it an engulfing first wave of powerful alterations on every level -- Bodily sensations, awareness of surroundings changing, inner thoughts, beliefs & memories all widening scope and re-combining.  As for bodily sensation, my stomach felt overflowing with bubbly gas foam, and I could taste too much ginger that I had added to the Tea (ironically, to fight nausea).  I was quietly afraid that I might puke right off and collapse in a heat stroke if I didnt sit down (and there was no place to sit), and that I was dangerously old and out of shape to climb a mountain while trespassing on unauthorized drugs --  WHAT HAD I DONE!?
