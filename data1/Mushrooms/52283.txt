Eventually, after what seemed an eternity of walking, we ended up in a McDonalds.  I was starting to come down now, and for the first time in a while, I was able to hold a conversation.  I didnt want any food, didnt even feel slightly hungry.  So while everyone else shovelled burgers down their gobs, I skinned up.  Although its legal, this old couple on the next table gave me some right evil looks.  I was still much too dosed up to give a shit.  I enjoyed that joint a lot, but I was a little saddened that the trip had ended, or at least was ending.
