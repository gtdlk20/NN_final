T+2:00: While we are sitting at the table I can finally discuss the big ass bowl of carrots with S. We both are amazed by the insanity of a HUGE bowl of carrots. We sit laughing for a while as I try to eat some of the carrots and some lettuce, not because I want to, but because I know that I havenÂ’t eaten all day, and will likely not be eating again tonight. The walls begin to change shapes, and the mirrors on the walls make me jumpy and anxious.
