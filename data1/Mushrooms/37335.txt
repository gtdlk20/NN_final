The hills around the ranch were lush and green, made mysterious and inaccessible-looking from the high mists.  I was excited and apprehensive as D and I vaulted the iron fence.  We were on a dubious errand, to say the least: collecting illegal, mind-altering mushrooms on a privately owned ranch.  Any number of things could go wrong with this scenario.  We could have dogs sicced on us, we could go to jail and if we were hurt somehow, we would only have each other to extricate ourselves.  Nonetheless my heart was filled with childlike joy at the prospect of getting a bag full of Â‘shrooms, and I knew we would be tripping on them that night.
