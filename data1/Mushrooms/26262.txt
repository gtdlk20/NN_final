After an eternity in a world free of existence, I returned to my room, still tripping hard. Every sight, every sound, every tick of a clock, every breath, and everything in the room had some kid of bizarre reverb attached to it. ReverbÂ…and desire. I knew this was the secret to life. Reverb and desire! Oh my god! It was amazing. I repeated it over to myself once, twice, a million times. I called Nick, who was also tripping on mushrooms. 'Reverb and desire!' I blurted. 'Don't you get it? Reverb and desire!'
