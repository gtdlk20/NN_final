I put on an Italian sub-titled movie and sipped at the brew. I am home alone. The taste was fine; it went down easy. I drank about 2/3 of the mix at 7pm and waited about half an hour. No physical nausea but definitely mental nausea. Thoughts like oh crap what have I done, Im a bit scared of this stuff. I felt a bit drugged and it was hard to concentrate on the movie so I went into my ensuite for a shower. I had a normal shower experience and at the end the drugs had worn off. I was completely baseline and a little bit tired. I was pleased about this a good nights sleep was definitely the go.
