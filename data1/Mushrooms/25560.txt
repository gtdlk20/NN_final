I realised that setting was important, we needed to be far away from the press of regular more sober humanity so we decided to head for Shell Island off the coast of Wales. Unfortunately we chose a very popular camping spot on a bank holiday so by the time we reached our destination it was overflowing with families, sober or worse drunk. There was no room at the Inn, and this brought my hopes for the day crashing down. Realising that staying positive was important If I was to have a pleasant, constructive experience I tried to keep my spirits up. This was hard, it had been a long hot drive and tension was evident amongst our normally very relaxed group. For the next few hours we searched the unfamiliar coastline for somewhere we felt comfortable to camp AND trip. It was a fruitless search and the tension grew along with my dissapointment, my birthday experience was panning out to be a crock of ass candy.
