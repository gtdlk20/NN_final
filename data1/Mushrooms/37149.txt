T +4:00  Kevin comes over and sits with us and although he doesnÂ’t experience the same connection he tries his best to follow to conversation.  I have been feeling words throughout the whole trip, the most powerful of which was experience, at the height of my visuals.  Now all I can think about are contentment and understanding.  I simultaneously feel more fulfilled than I ever have in my entire life and as if I can comprehend anything and anyone in the universe.  Everything appears to be exactly how it should be and my thoughts are more cohesive than they have ever been.  There exist no words to explain the sheer dimensions that my mind was able to take on.  Our conversations continued for almost an hour and forty-five minutes.  Every single thought I had seemed to be a revelation of unspeakable magnitude.  I commented several times that I never wanted any of this to end, and J and E expressed their agreement.
