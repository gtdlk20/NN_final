Whats more, within the psychedelic community it is little reported but quietly accepted that the tryptamines open up the Third Eye and awaken and enhance our psychic abilities like no other communion.  This makes for an exciting but also a tricky and even dangerous marriage between the spiritual and the psychedelic worlds, where all of the above angles and realms cross over and intermingle.  Personal opinions can be presented as truths and objective visions can be experienced as fanciful imagination.  It is a fairground of confusion with gems of Cosmic truth and garbage of Hellish excrement.  The game is started, the dice are rolled and the Trickster appears to be the biggest winner of all, as player and game maker all at once. Gareth Stack's Psychology in Mind Episode 5 has more on the views and potential touched upon here.
