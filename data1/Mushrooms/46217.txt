As we approached the slightly larger village that we had to pass through to get to the beach (larger meaning it had one pub and one shop), L started to voice his anxiety at passing people while on mushrooms. In some ways what happened was his own fault, because while others we take drugs with can learn how to relax and not work themselves up into worry while tripping or taking E, L always focuses on whether it is working, what effects everyone is getting, and whether he's in a good place. I figured it would be fine though once we got there because the place was so small and there were not many people about. As we got to the village shop, we spotted some new friends that we had brought with us to the island who were not on mushrooms and stopped to talk to them while C went inside to buy some juice. All of a sudden L started to sound quite panicky and then out of nowhere, stumbled backwards and fainted, knocking his head into the gravel. It was all a bit of a blur, but he got back up and said he felt better, and then all of a sudden lunged forward and fainted in the other direction. It was terrifying because it looked as if he was having a fit - his head jerked up and down, but we think retrospectively that he was actually just quickly losing and regaining and then losing consciousness. The people in the shop came out very worried and asked if he was diabetic or epileptic, and we all must have looked very sheepish as we were pretty paranoid about them realising we were off our faces. I went into the shop to buy some sugary drinks for L and food to sober myself up and suddenly was very conscious of how pale and worried I looked and the fact that I'd gone outside wearing no make up and ridiculous clothes.
