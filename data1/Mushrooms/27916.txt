Zap! The Noise was back, louder and more painful than ever. I turned off the computer and tried again to contact the mushroom entities. There was no response. I moved again, into the living room. I laid down on the couch and drifted back into trance. The Noise was still there, but I felt I could control it somewhat by changing my thought patterns when I heard it. I also noticed that it manifested itself whenever I started to fall asleep. I felt better and began enjoying the trance. I spent a lot of time thinking about those people that I love, seeing things from their points of view. However, I didn't have much choice as to what I was allowed to think about; I had wanted to try some experiments during this trip and I didn't have the opportunity. I was a little disappointed until the next trance.
