I thought about the absurdity of everything and realized many things about humanity. I realized that 'the system' is our culture. We're all just fucking with each other, we can't get along and trust each other, we can't let each other know that we are really all the same and all feel the same way because we're afraid, and so we've created this horrible, inhuman, cold 'system'. It's our culture. I thought alot about this, and thought about what it would be like to live in some African village. I wandered around for awhile, and stumbled across a HUGE patch of some unidentified mushrooms. I picked one and put it in a bag of pot.
