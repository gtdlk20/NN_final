T+ 00:30. Once we sat down to eat, me and B both were at about the same level of consciousness. This was at the stage of the come-up, but not a full blown trip yet of course. B's pupils were more dilated than I've ever seen; blackness just completely over his eyes. At this point we were both laughing extremely hard at everything. To me, everything looked, and felt, like it was a cartoon. My body felt like it was kind of melting in with everything around me (which feels pretty amazing, I should say). Once we sat down me and B both just laughed and talked. We almost forgot about the drugs we just consumed.
