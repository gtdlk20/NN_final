I started to notice contrast in everything: the sun rises and then sets, there is light over the earth, then darkness, the leaves on trees die and then grow back with the seasonal changes, humans (and all forms of life) die and their bodies feed the earth, which uses these atoms to feed whatever else lives.  I started to feel like I was no different than a plant, or a rock.  I felt like even inanimate objects like the road, or a fence, or streetlights were alive because they were no more than a collection of atoms just like me.  And when I die, my atoms will disperse into the earth. Part of me will be soaked up by trees from the soil, and used in their internal chemical processes.  Therefore, I will be a tree when I die.  The minerals within me will solidify into rock and therefore I will also be a rock when I die.  But the list is endless.  I am 60% water, so when I die, I will be rainwater, part of a river, an ocean, coca Cola, etc.
