I was also shown the ripple effect, how everything we do has an outward effect on the universe. All our thoughts, words and actions have different vibrational energies. Each living organism broadcast energies including the universe and all energies interact with each other. Love is the most powerful vibrational energy that can be emitted by humans.  This is important because we receive from others similar frequencies that we project, e.g. if youÂ’re angry all the time, chances are you will encounter a lot of other angry people.
