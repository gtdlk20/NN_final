What took me by surprise most is how disconnected and distant I felt from everyone and everything around me following the trip; this lasted intensely for a few days. I thought that perhaps Id be able to connect to my emotions much more easily after the experience but it was actually the other way around, I found I had to almost relearn how to feel for and with others. Im a hyper empathetic person so this frightened me as well.
