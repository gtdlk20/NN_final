Bang. Gone again and this time its not so nice. I'm standing on a platform in a huge cave like a mountain hall from Lord of the Rings, and all around me are beings floating around me. Some dont look very nice at all. Its also very dark but I can see them And they see me. Its like we are all just waiting there. One of the beings, a 3 meter long massively built dragon comes very close and I'm not very comfortable now. I know I dont stand a chance if he wants to hurt me. But I hear myself say to him in some way (maybe I speak dragon or whatever) hey we're all in this together cant we just be friends? I can see hes surprised and he looks suspiciously at me but then I understand hes ok with it. Reeeeelief. Now the Dragon starts rotating, spinning fast as hell while growing and after a while hes as big as 3 football fields together. I'm very glad I choose the friendly approach and I feel I got a friend and protector there. Lesson learned. Be nice to dragons.
