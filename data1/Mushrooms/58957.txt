I glanced over to my friend, to notice he was in a deep trance.  He began to moan in pain, I questioned what was happening, and he said it was far to scary to explain.  My other friend began to get the same trance, but deeper.  He became very depressed and sad looking. Minutes later he came out of his trance and we all finished smoking.
