When walking past one house everyone sees a plant that looks like a face, except me. We stop and stare, at the window where the plant is located, for a couple of minutes. I try to see the plant but fail. As I mentioned before all things around us expressed feelings, houses, cars, trees, everything. The ground looked like it floated half a meter over itself. P and N got 'transparent vision' after looking down on the ground and the looking back up. I never understood what they really meant.
