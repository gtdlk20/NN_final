Oct. 17  There are pin heads on all 7 cakes in terrariums.   The best two cakes have shrooms a ¼ inch in diameter and 1 ½ inches tall.  None of the pin heads have aborted yet, at least not that I can tell.  It seems that more and more pin heads are being produced along with the older pinheads.  They also appear to grow in clumps.  One of the cakes, on the top, its completely covered in primordia.  Fantastic.
