We caught a glimpse of the computerÂ’s clock on accident by this time and saw that it was 4:30pm, this was the first trip that kind of felt time relative.  I think its mostly because the sun helped us, since its winter, at about 2 the sun begins to rapidly set, so it almost felt like time passed really fast, yet our experience felt like an eternity, so it kind of balanced out.  We talked about love, and The Beatles, and how there are so few men who think of such beautiful simple lyrics as they did, and how we wanted a man to think of us like that one day.
