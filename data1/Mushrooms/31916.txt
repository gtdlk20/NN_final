I felt myself sink further and further into my negative state. My mind erupted with thoughts. I thought about how amazing and incredibly beautiful the mushroom was, and how by staying in this environment- we were misusing it. Our friend and his mate were sitting back, drinking and ripping bongs. It was 4:30 by then and I was peaking. In conjunction with this I felt feelings of both anger and sadness, at how much we were wasting the peak of the trip, sitting at a house on the couch watching people drink and smoke. I myself was not in the mood for weed. Both me and my friend left eventually the house, leaving them behind. The positive emotional intensity of the trip had diminished, and this made me even more upset. I begun to cry-I did not wish to at all but I was no longer in control of my emotions. I felt even worse due to the fact that my own negativity had reflected onto my friend, making her feel a similar way.
