But that something did give me room to play, when I asked. I was curious to see what would happen when I engaged the tremor system to shake (something Ive been experimenting with in my movement practice). It was intense, interesting, and led me to try also the twitch - that is, to fire everything at once, in the briefest moment possible. What would that look and feel like? I got it a few times, and the result got me thinking that maybe there would be a pleasure in seizures. Maybe not.
