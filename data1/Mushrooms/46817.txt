My boyfriend and I were really antsy during our spring semester at school one year and decided to head south for some warmth. We found an island that we could camp on, completely secluded and uninhabited, and thought it the perfect place to get some rest and relaxation. Just for fun we brought some leftover mushrooms that we had lying around from a previous week. We had to take a ferry to get to the island, and we arranged to be picked up again 3 days later. We couldn't hold our excitement at being all alone and far away from civilization - we grabbed our tent and our bags of food and ran through the trees and towards the dunes.
