I could hardly bear to look at anything anymore because the complexity of discerning whether or not I was seeing what I thought I saw overwhelmed me again (although it sounds scary, the overwhelming-ness was a very good feeling).  There was just so much raw information flooding my brainÂ’s sensory receptors (or so it seemed) that I had to bury my face in the comforter and stare into the darkness it provided to retain my sanity.
