Like every past experience with mushrooms I wasn't expecting a whole lot (more like just being higher than high). Perhaps because I had never taken more than one gram before.  So when I first felt the effects of lightheadedness and brighter than usual objects, I wasn't expecting to experience what I ended up experiencing. About 20 minutes into the trip I was still fairly grounded in reality, which is how I expected to feel for the next couple hours as the chemicals took effect.  I know I started to stare out the window of the 5th floor apartment.  My buddy would look back occasionally to see what I was looking at, but he had only smoked weed so I would get giddy the more often he looked back, knowing he couldn't see what I was seeing. We had also put in a video tape called 'Beyond the Mind's Eye' which is completely computer generated imagery, but for some reason I couldn't stay concentrated on it and my eyes would wander back to the window.  I think it was because my mind was starting to see things in the black sky, which my eyes were not yet seeing.  Another reason I couldn't stay focused on the video was because of how superficial it looked.  I had bought the video back in 1996, so being fairly old, the pictures appeared often fuzzy with static noise in the background.  Looking at the TV simply made me think how corny it was.
