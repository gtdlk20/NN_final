At this point I knew I was really high, but I was unsure if I had reached plateau. I remember thinking that the trip seemed familiar because last time I had a similar experience with my walls. I felt as if I knew that this here, right now, was the highest I've been on this drug, and that I've been here before. So in a way I was at the plateau of my past experience. I was about to break through and I had no idea it was about to happen.
