Since not many of you have access to gram scales, and don't want to spend the money to buy one, I'll tell you the system we use to measure out doses. First off, the method of preparation we use is to dry out the shrooms thoroughly (sun-dry or chemical dessication), and pulverize them into a semi-fine powder. (1mm diameter and smaller, about the same size as coarse salt) You might find that the stems don't crush so easily, so I sometimes mince them up with a good knife.
