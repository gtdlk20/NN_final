I had just woken up for the first time in my life. I had been asleep forever and then I suddenly became aware of reality. I looked at C(who is extremely beautiful) and her eyes began to move, the left one went up and the right one went down, then vice versa. We walked around campus for a while then we ran into some teachers. I got scared and started to panic, but C calmed me down. We sat on the steps and looked at the sky and listened to the birds and the fountain in the pond at the front of our school(its an agricultural school so its very nature-ish).
