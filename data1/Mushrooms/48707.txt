Our sense of time was utterly shattered. A minute would seem like a year. T and M sat on the matress with the light next to it, and M and I told T to turn off the light. He would turn it on for a few seconds, then turn it back on again and ask us, 'What is...on? It could mean a billion things.' I then would say, 'Back in 1999.' And then M and I would ask T to turn off the light. He'd turn it off and back on again and repeat, 'What is....on? It could mean a billion things.' I would repeat myself and say, 'Back in 1999.' This cycle repeated at least 100 times, and we could not stop it. I had to go to the bathroom, so I walked upstairs and pissed for an eternity. I heard panting and I turned around only to see 2 huge dilated eyes watching me go to the bathroom. I finished and told T to hurry up and not do anything else other than piss. I walked downstairs and we both agreed it was very hard to walk.
