Gradually, my paranoia increased and I thought that the cops that were there knew I was fucked up and were coming for me.  I went to walk down the stairs toward the exit to escape but I saw flashing red and blue lights at the bottom.  They had me cornered!  I saw condom wrappers and thousands of cigarette butts on the floor among other things and *knew* that they were all mine and they represented all the bad things I had done.  Suddenly, all the people started coming down the stairs and I distinctly heard and saw multiple people saying, 'I'm getting out of here.  The people are doing some fucked up things.'  Everyone WAS talking about ME.  I walked back up the stairs and everywhere I went I saw cops.  I thought they were coming for me.  I remember thinking that I had really messed up and everyone would hate me for the bad things I had done and I would be in jail.  I walked over to a place to sit down.  I remember my friends finding me and talking about how much I had eaten.  It was surreal.  They tried to help me and give me water, but I thought, what was the point?!
