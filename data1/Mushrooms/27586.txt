My second encounter with the Mushroom. My first trip had been a rather frightening success (Level 5: 1st trip, ego death), and it made me hesitant to go back there. While tripping I had sworn never to touch mushrooms again but then reconsidered after an apparently safe return to ordinary reality. I decided that I would give it another chance. If I went into the same over-intense trip, I would reconsider ever taking it again.
