I have been wanting to trip on shrooms again for about three years now, after reading The Archaic Revival by Terrence McKenna, and then becoming a big fan of his writing and speaking.  Also, over the course of those few years, I took an interest in indigenous cultures and especially those cultures which included entheogens in their practices.
