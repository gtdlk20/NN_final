I was handed a pipe with some pot in it, and as it had helped with my anxiety earlier, i took a couple big hits. WOW. Suddenly, i went from having slight patterning and some very mild closed eye visuals to full on open eye hallucinations. The movie the Matrix was on, and it was like looking at it through a kaleidoscope. I could see the image, it made total sense, but it just looked totally different...things were morphing, patterns appeared, it all looked like it was made of liquid. It absolutely fascinated me...i have never had real visuals before... Also, when i would look at wood, it would sudenly not be a flat surface anymore, but had a 3d
