Once the five people I was with had got to taco bell, the other four went somewhere else and they were going to meet us there. So once we got there I started to feel very strange. I felt like nothing was right, I did not want to have any belongings on me. I felt that my clothes weren't suppose to be on. I felt everything I did was not suppose to feel this way. Then I started to worry about where my brother was I was getting really scared because I was stuck with four other goomers like they would take the time to help me. I started to say to myself ' why did I do this, this was fucking stupid '. Then I called my brother on my cell and he tried to help me over the phone but he couldn't so I had to wait until he got there luckily he wasn't too far away. When I ended my call I looked at my phone and it was so small probably about 4 cm. Big in the palm of my hand.
