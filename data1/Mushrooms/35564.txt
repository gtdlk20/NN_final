Then, suddenly, everything went black, and I felt a hard cold wall against my face.  I pushed against it to push myself away, and realised it wasn't a wall, it was the tiled floor of the pub.  That was the strangest feeling of vertigo I've ever had - 'forward' was actually 'down'.  There were about 15 people standing around me, a few asked if I was okay.  I said I've never felt better, which was true, I had stopped tripping altogether.  My friend hauled me up and we left the pub.  Outside, I asked him 'What the hell happened?!'.  He said 'That's what I was going to ask you!'.
