I went back to the camp and decided to smoke a couple bowls with my friends which sent my trip into a planet.  Colors seemed to radiate off of everything which gave my surroundings a cartoony feel.  My mind was in utter amazement with the world I had sent myself into.  I enjoyed the festival, talking to everyone I could.  I realized I was speaking nonsense to everyone I could so I decided to settle myself down by going back to the concert. It was supposed to thunderstorm while we were out there but it ended up only causing lightning in the sky above because of the heat.  Everyone at the festival was amazed by the dry lightning.  When it would strike it seemed as if it slowed down and left a picture of itself into the sky and would not go away.  The clouds swirled into a pastel funnel that seemed to lead into space.
