Last year, I was an exchange student to Japan.  It was a life changing experience in many ways.  One of the best things about Japan is that the Magic Mushrooms are legal.  You can go to a head shop and pick and chose from dozens of sacks.  Me and my friend who was also an exchange student had eaten the mushrooms every weekend for the past 4 weeks.  However, we had not eaten cubensis for about 2 months.
