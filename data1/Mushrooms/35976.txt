I concentrated on using the energy to slow J's heart rate (I did not tell him I was doing this, we did not talk at all while I was doing it or before).  T meowed, and I felt it was time, so I put my right hand on J's chest and released the energy into him, focusing on slowing his heart.  He exhaled sharply and said 'wow'.  I felt his heart slow.  I asked him what he felt when I touched him.  He said he didn't know, but it was indescribable and amazing, and he felt something.  And felt his heart slow, and the panic attack subside.  I have never tried an energy focus/transfer before, and could not believe I did it without ever having tried it or without knowing what I was doing.  I just felt I needed to use T's feline energy, and also silently called on my spirit guide for help, and it worked!  T, who had been running around when we came into the living room, jumped off the couch after I did it and flopped on the floor.
