We finally reached our destination, a dual carriageway that goes over the river. Underneath it is a very peaceful place we had discovered 2 years previously on shrooms, and named the Temple.  We tripped out on some strange graffiti people had written there over the years, including a weird poem, something like, In the age of knights and armour, there lived a hairy llama.  We sat on a stone bank going down into the river and chilled out for a while, seeing the other side of the river and the underside of the bridge form some kind of gods face.  Eventually we got worried about the safety of the place as our shroomed minds were convinced the bridge was about to collapse. We moved on to a tunnel that runs through the ground underneath the dual carriageway not far from where we were. That was where we spent the next 200 years of our lives, or so it seemed.
