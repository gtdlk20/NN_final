Now I think it's not, because it's very intresting to listen to other people's opinion. What I mean is: I could watch 'myself' constructing the reality around me, instrumentalizing all the wonders of nature for its own ability to sit around, take some shrooms, smoke some weed and laugh its ass off, not knowing why or how. If you know Leary you got a glimpse of what I mean, it's the neuroelectric circuit, the awareness of constructing perception, damn cybernetic consciousness, man! I was able to imagine everything I wanted, like flowing through my bloodstream, finally coming out of one of the pores of my arm. Then, my skin was like the bark of a tree, protecting the inside, nothing more. When I finally came down I felt very exhausted (its hard to laugh for hours) and pissed off, since reality became what it was before. Now I feel gratitude for the wonders of the world but there is also sadness because of the cruelty and greed in human society. I'll never be able to understand how people can sell their soul for materialistic advantages. Wealth is a matter of perception and perception can be changed by most simple means.
