Overview: this was by far the best trip I've ever had on mushrooms. Following the trip, I felt amazing. I felt clean and refreshed. Mentally cleansed. Though there was a tough part near the 6-8 hr point (the metal assault as I called it), I now feel that it was a good thing in the end. I feel I needed it, and the trip pushed those thoughts to the front of my mind. I could not escape, because those were thoughts, problems and feelings that I needed to deal with and come to terms with. It was very eye-opening, and one of the more meaningful experiences I've had. I now feel that I wish to explore more with Mushrooms and similar psychidelics which I had previously been somewhat shy of, with a better understanding of them, and their potential.
