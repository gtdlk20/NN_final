I began my substance use at the young age of 13. It quickly excelled past recreational drug use and it became an addiction/ habit. The addiction wasn't to marijuana but rather just being high, didn't matter what is was from. The next 5 years of my life were difficult. I suffered from addiction and at the same time I was very confused about who I was, what I believe in and why I felt this way. During this time I had an intense relationship with marijuana but I also began using drugs such as mdma, cocaine, and prescription pain killers. When I was 18 one day I realized something has to change, either I stop all this bad behavior and submit myself to Christianity or reject the religion and explore for my own solution.
