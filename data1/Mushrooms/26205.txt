Anyhow, I told my dad I was going out for a quick walk, which I did actually do. I just happened to also be meeting my neighbor Jake along the way and picking up psychotropic mushrooms from him. When I got home, about 30 minutes later, I pulled the mushrooms from my pocket and looked at them. Trustworthy Jake had yet again pleased me greatly. I had in my possession a 'large' eighth, moderately crushed inside the sandwich bag. There were several moderately large caps in the bag, and with satisfaction I put them in my stash box.
