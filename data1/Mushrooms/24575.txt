Joe seemed huge and when he walked around I thought of him as a giant troll dragging a club.  Phils eyes turned a blazing red, his ears became pointy, and his teeth grew into fangs.  I became scared and nervous and retreated to the couch alone.  I stayed in the same spot for a solid 2 hours.  I became deeply emerged in my own thoughts and thats when I felt like I had reached nirvana and achieved enlightenment.
