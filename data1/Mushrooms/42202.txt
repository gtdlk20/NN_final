The only thing I really remember distinctly was a feeling of euphoria.  Nothing seemed to matter to me except that the world was a peaceful, happy place.  Despite my usual aversions to dirt and leaves tracked into the tent, for some reason I had no problem rubbing my face and head in it.  It definitely wasn't purposeful, but I didn't even notice that this was the situation until I had been doing it for some time, and when I realized that this was the case, I did not feel compelled to move.  It was just pure happiness and bliss.  Even now, when I think about that night, I smile and my mood is improved.  It was just such a positive experience.
