I had bought 21 g of high quality mushrooms, and planned for me and two friends to take 7 g per person. The location was my friend Ms bedroom, from which we left and entered the woods around his house. We mixed the mushrooms into orange juice, and we all downed our doses. I had not done research on doses of mushrooms, and neglected to follow my fathers advice on a healthy dose when asking him earlier the same day.

N took 7 grams alongside me, however M took 3-4 grams instead of the full 7 without my knowledge. As we were sitting in Ms room, N tried to put his arm around me and I freaked out. I was about to punch him, but I found my voice and asked him to not do that, as I was incredibly anxious and having a rough come up. We listened to some chill music, Watsky, and we prepared to go outside to meet up with some friends who werent tripping. I was losing coherency fast, and I felt like a knife blade: sharpened and created to injure myself. It was a very dark emotion and it was all I felt.
