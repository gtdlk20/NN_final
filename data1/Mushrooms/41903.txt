 T+50: Around this time I had a brief image of a freak show clown in inverted flashing colours with an impossibly intense and itself uncomfortable grin and eyes, which I took to be the carnival-esque drug fuelled and self-destructive desire for more and for excess that is so prevalent in modern society  the filthy and dark truth that we are destroying ourselves and the planet and that we at times revel in it, like cocaine addicts. It didnt make me particularly uncomfortable because I recognised it as a part of myself and had faith in the mushrooms ability to heal through insight. I was also getting really annoyed at the large amount of flies nipping at my ankles and fighting each other around me. The guy who was fishing around the lake had moved much closer and I didnt feel comfortable enough to have any kind of normal conversation with him so I decided it was time to get moving.
