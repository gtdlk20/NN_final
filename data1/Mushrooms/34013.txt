When they finally returned to the theater, my sister's friend returned to our seats and Ace just stood at the bottom of the stairs looking up with a terrified look on his face. The theater was pretty much at capacity and PACKED with people. He proceeded to go to the front row and sit down in the only remaining seat next to some strangers (2 adults thank goodness). We could all see him from where we were sitting and the people he sat next to were looking at him strangely. He kept turning around and looking for us, and I could see there were tears streaming down his face. Needless to say, the strangers were probably pretty freaked out to have some weird guy come sit next to them and cry through most of the movie.
