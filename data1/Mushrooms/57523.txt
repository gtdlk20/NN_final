One night me and four other friends desided to take part in a journy together. Unfortunately we got seperated and we were forced to go home. Well after an hour long giggling sesh my friend bunked off and left me alone. I turned off the light and then tried to slip away, oh I did slip away, into the truth. I saw the creation of the universe unfold and then end, and then begin again, and then end, and then begin again. Then a voice told me that this is the two energy states of 'this' universe, it has begining (1) and end (2), and the voice was part of a collective of omnipitant information telling me the ironic plight of omnipitancy. They have to live in a universe that they've seen happen over and over and over 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2. They have (we have) been doing this forever and will be doing this forever.Sort of like Groundhogs Day. They also told me that this is one of infanite other universes, each haveing different rules. I know there are other people that know this to, a comprehension beyond any.
