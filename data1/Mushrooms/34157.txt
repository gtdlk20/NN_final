The most intense part of the trip was when I reached the hut though.  I managed to make it haha.  I sat in a chair and put my sunglasses on and when I did this my visuals got insane.  I was lookin at the roof of the hut and all these fucking colors were swirling and doing this wavy motion.  It was like looking through a kalidoscope.  I swear for about 30 seconds I lost touch with reality.  That part was my peak and after about an hour I was almost sober and I clocked out and just chilled so I could come down completely before I drove.
