Still amazed at what she had done, I had a shroom thought. One of thoughts that doesn't seem to come from me but resonates from the depths of all of existence. It said 'this is love.' She gave me her happiness and took my pain. And I knew I had to do the same. So I concentrated, meditated if you will. And soon her eyes were drying and she was smiling again. It was like she'd come up for air. She said 'whoa, that was intense.' I, on the other hand, had returned to a trip of confusion and overwhelming vulnerability. I said 'I'm stuck again.' She said she knew. And soon we had switched again. This time though, she seemed confused. She was crying again and said, 'but why am I crying. You don't cry.' In my state, I seemed to know all the answers and told her that on a sober level, this is how we deal with pain. She just looked confused at this. I tried explaining another way with no success and remembered what it was like when I was in that trip. Nothing makes sense. I laughed at the irony. That the one of us who searches for answers understands nothing and the one who knows cannot bring it to make sense. So again, I gave the good trip to her. Now I was again confused and she was excited. All the questions she had just asked were making sense to her.
