I awaited this day for a while, I went to visit my friend (we'll call 'R' from here). R wasn't all too experienced with any psychedelics except low doses of mushrooms and acid. I picked up an oz of PES Amazonian mushrooms to have saved for 5 or so months, at least. I told R we were gonna make some tea to digest our doses (weighed out to roughly 5 grams) so I brought over some ginger and yerba mate to mix it with, although after arrival to his house we decided we shouldn't waste a lick of time and just ate them almost immediately after. We planned to take a hike near his property to this tree, it must've been 10-20 minutes away but it stood out more than any other tree, it was big. We started to hike up and R started to say he didn't feel anything, I managed to retort, 'I dunno man, my vision is starting to get... wider.' we looked as hard as we could for the tree but it seemed hopeless after about 25 minutes of searching, we found a nice spot to sit down after deciding we'd never get to the tree, I tried on light refracting glasses that I'd brought to see if it was gonna be trippy, it was pretty underwhelming.
