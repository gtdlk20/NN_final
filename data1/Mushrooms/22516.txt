But if I was God, then there was a problem. Why was I still trapped in this very limiting human body? So I pressed into the walls again, figuring I could escape this way. But I started worrying that the unlocalised sensation would become infinitely powerful, so I stopped. It seemed I was trapped in this human form for now, but how had I ended up here, and where was I going?
