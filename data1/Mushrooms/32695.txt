I went to my aunt's room, and talked to her for a bit. She asked me how it was and everything. She has never done shrooms. She grew up in the 70's, so she has done just about every other drug ever, but she's not a druggie blowout. She would tell me stories about how she would take mescaline before going to school. Which turned out to be very funny stories. We talked for about 45 minutes. With her cat climbing on top of my shoulders and laying down. She does this quite often though.
