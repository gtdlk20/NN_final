About 30 min after the shrooms began to kick in my friends were back. I wanted to explore the city but they all wanted to get drunk before they went out. My friend 'M' was the only one who wanted to come with me. We walked to the elevators. The carpet is a light almost neon blue while it has bright pink flamingos flowing on it with endless patterns. Once we reached the elevator and stepped inside I nearly freaked out since inside the elevators is mirrors all around I saw my reflection and laughed my ass off. M pressed and button which seemed to glow a bright pink and we descended into the matrix of Vegas.
