I kept thinking of Ozzy Osborne in the episode of The Osbournes where he is bearing his arse at the fire and shouting: 'I like warming my butt by the fire!!!'. I decided to do a recap of it all and ended up repeating over and over again: 'I like warming my butt by the fire! I like BMX on the moon! I am transcendental cheese! Today is cheeseday!'. By now I was starting to drift back into reality and I could fully appreciate the hilarity of the situation. Visuals were still kind of strong though. With open eyes everything was so bright it was difficult to look at, with closed eyes I saw stunningly beautiful ribbons and rainbows.
