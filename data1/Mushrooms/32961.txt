Camille eventually led me on a few adventures to walk around and inspect the surrounding buildings, one of which happened to be an art building, filled with exciting stimuli for my ever distorted mind. Every single moment and event was changing and exciting. When we got to the bathrooms of the arts complex, my euphoria was still plateauing, and the unfamiliarity of a school that wasnt my own wasnt even on my mind. Being in an interior for the first time in 2 hours was a very rich and complex experience, and stimulated my perception immensely after being in the expansive sunlit day. While in the bathroom alone (Ive always found bathrooms to be the most interesting places while tripping, dont ask me why) I became extremely amused, and started laughing. Nothing about the dimensions of the place was staying the same.
