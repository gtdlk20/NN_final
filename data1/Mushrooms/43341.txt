One of my elementary school friends had traveled past us and stopped by to say hello. He looked very different than when I last saw him 7 years ago (who wouldnt). I knew that I was supposed to know him but I had no idea who he was at the time. After he had left I asked my friend who he was. His reply was are you serious you dont remember? I felt as if I was put on the spotlight and everyone was looking at me (they werent). This fear of being stared at spiraled and I started to get scared. After the talking stopped I reminded myself I was just tripping and I was still tethered to reality.
