On the train to the beach I felt an uneasy and heavy feeling in my stomach. The text on my phone and on the sign across from me on the train begun to subtlety warp. I closed my eyes and laid back in my seat, headphones in. Patterns of kaleidoscope and colour were overlaying my vision once I had closed my eyes. The music playing was rich and deep, it felt as if it pulsed from one ear to another- rippling through my brain. I was not focused on many of the vocals in songs, but more the different tones and beat playing in the background. In my mind, the music was being painted in colours. I picked up on certain sounds that I had not acknowledged when had I listened to the song in my sober state.
