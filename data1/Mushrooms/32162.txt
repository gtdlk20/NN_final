We were dropped off at the start of the trails around 2:30 in the afternoon and went into the woods. After hiking for a few minutes, we found a small creek to stop at and eat the mushrooms. It being my first time, I was overcome by a wave of emotions: excitement, fear of the unknown, anticipation of a great experience. The bitterness of the mushrooms filled our mouths and we quickly drank a lot of the water we brought with us to get rid of the taste.
