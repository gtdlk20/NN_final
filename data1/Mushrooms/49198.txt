Now let me tell you...the aquarium is SHROOM HEAVEN. Everything is glowing and is light by shades of blue or green..there are trippy lights and signs everywhere, and the exhibits are really dark, so these stand out alot. Not to mention all the crazy sea creatures, especially the Jelly Fish. What a trip!
