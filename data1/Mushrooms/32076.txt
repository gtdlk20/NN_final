Preface: This was an experiment to determine my tolerance levels to a threshold dose, as I had never tried these before and couldnt find many reports on sclerotia on the interwebs. I tend to have a strong reaction to psilocybin/ psilocin and its cousins (a 10mg dose of 4-Aco-DMT literally knocked me on my ass  I actually passed out for a moment when it kicked in - and a 3.5g dose of mushrooms of an unknown strain brought complete ego death and gnosis). So my goal was to play it safe and see what kind of experience 5g fresh sclerotia would bring.
