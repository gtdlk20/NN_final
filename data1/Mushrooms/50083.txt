At this point someone said something like they didn't like the way i acted when i was tripping and that hurt me really bad and i was talking to them saying how i though that was fucked up and how no one liked me and i just got into this who big thing about people not likeing me and how i was a loser then he said i had low self esteem and it was all in my head which now i realize it true it never phased me till that moment. Anyway we finally went in the pool the water felt great it didn't really feel like water either, anyway, our sitter suggested making a whirl pool with it so we started and my feet felt like they were sinking in to the ground which really started to freak me out  so i sat on the side and i was talking to other people.
