We went back into my bedroom and went back into the experience. I remember seeing the universe and then the universe sagging under the weight of a bright yellow ball. A hand came up and swirled around the yellow ball. And tiles of gold falling from each of its fingers from the darkness above the ball emerged a hooded figure who appeared to be watching over the universe. And then a song came on that I think is particularly overwhelming I asked if I could change it but changed my mind after I said it because I decided I wanted to hear it. When it got to the part that is overwhelming I remember seeing everything in my vision melt and glitch and then I saw hundreds of people fist pumping to the beat but instead of fists they were flipping me off. I thought it was hilarious and beautiful.
