So there it was, I had found it; something magical, mystical, and terrifying. I am convinced that shrooms and other types of hallucinogens can make the impossible possible. In that one night, I had my entire perception flipped upside down. I now know that there is so much more to this existence than meets the eye. I appreciate beautiful things as well as the things I love so much more than I did before. The experience gave me a positive outlook on all aspects of life. It made me believe that there is no way that death is eternal blackness. This life is too magical and beautiful for that to be the truth. We are only experiencing the tip of the iceberg of existence and walk around with filters not allowing people to see the magic that is right in front of them. Ever since then I have been fascinated by existence itself. How is any of this possible? My life was given new meaning.
