It is also best when I have achieved a goal in life or reached a benchmark (even a small one) that makes me truly happy about my achievement. To me this is very important. I set many goals for myself and may feel depressed if I dont reach them, but if I break that goal down into smaller tasks and benchmarks that are within practical reach, and visualize each benchmark as part of the larger goal, I then have reason to celebrate. Even if I have to push the larger goal further into the future it is gratifying to reach these smaller benchmarks. Take small steps, but take steps.
