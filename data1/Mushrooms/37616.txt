When I asked myself what my purpose of life was, I realized every human being wonders the same thing.  Most believe whatever their parents tell them when they are children, or whatever they hear when attending religious services.  But what their parents know and what religious texts say are just othersÂ’ opinions and feelings of why we are here.  Essentially, nobody knows why the universe is here and what purpose our lives have.  Many pious men and women forget that fact and unconsciously take what their parents, religion, or society says about the matter as universal truths, when in fact it is anything but the case.
