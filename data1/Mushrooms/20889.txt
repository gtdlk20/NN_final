Mom? My heart almost exploded! It was such a powerful realization that I literally, physically felt my heart gush a tremendous amount of energy and I had to double over holding my chest, MOM! MomÂ… My eyes immediately filled with tears. At the exact moment I doubled over, a tremendous wind blew down my street swaying all the trees and even causing people to exclaim out-loud in surprise at the seemingly random gale. People walked passed me staring, at me as well. I straightened back up, hid my tears and turned around to head back inside.
