I ate exactly 5 dried grams at about 9:30 of 10 PM.  I ate a generous bite of banana nut bread, chewed it and put as many shrooms in my mouth as I could, until I tasted shrooms.  Knowing I had a while before they kicked in, I took my shower and prepared for bed as usual.  I filled a 1.5 liter aquafina bottle with water and set it next to my bed.  I turned off my fan, stereo and even my computer.  I did not want even the slightest hum to interfere with my trip, taking Terence McKenna's advice of engaging in a high-dose trip in the dark of your own room where you feel comfortable and will not be disturbed.
