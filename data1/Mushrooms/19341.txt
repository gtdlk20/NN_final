I crouched on the floor in childs pose and sobbed a little bit. I felt so much shame, in myself and my actions this evening. I felt I had become a danger to myself, and that is the surest sign of going too far, if I become a danger to myself or others. I felt ashamed of my ranting and raving all night (I am normally a very quiet tripper), ashamed that everyone else just had to listen to me rant. Ashamed of potentially disturbing other members of the household. I felt I had gone a little crazy this evening, and its never an easy feeling when you come face-to-face with the potential of your own insanity.
