My visuals got wild, spiraling from all kinds of directions and looking jagged and sharp, but in colors so vivid they were almost new to my eyes. The fractals began to pulse along with some weird beating sensation inside of me and I noticed this strange, white light opening up from the sky behind my head. I saw it first in my peripheral vision and then it stayed as I questioned Does my friend see this too? I tried to ask him if he saw that weird light but its like I forgot how to communicate. I forgot spoken language and I couldnt convey body language either. I was still overwhelmed by the nothingness I felt from not-knowing and the white light grew brighter, and brighter, and then it filled my entire field of vision. My friend was speaking to me but his voice slowly faded out and was replaced with this loud roaring, like some kind of engine. I started to scream, but I couldnt scream with my mouth, only my thoughts. I felt little moans and murmurs come out of my mouth instead. The white light was blinding and I could see no more as something held me down. I could not get back up. It felt like if someone were to take a car tire to the back of your head and rev the engine, but the wheel was made of plasmatic white light. Then it also felt like someone or something was cleaning my brain but scrubbing too hard. Instead of the feeling of 'I'm not supposed to be here', I felt at home. This felt natural, as if some force or being was cleaning out my soul and saying 'Tsk, Tsk, look at the mess of a being you are'. It made me think of when a child wrecks their house and a parent tends to the mess, annoyed but still expressing unconditional love for their child by cleaning up after it.
