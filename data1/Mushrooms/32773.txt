Then, back in the living room the phone rang!!!! Neil passed it to me but I didnt see his arm. It was as though the phone appeared in front of me. I answered it and to my shock it was my Dad. Whilst trying my best to understand what he was saying I became very uneasy about the fact I could hear my dads voice in my head had I gone schizophrenic? Why was I holding the phone to my ear? of course I thought with momentary relief, Im speaking to my dad on the phone. I was so relieved. But the relief wasnt to last. He informed me that his girlfriend was on some kind of hell bent revenge rampage to my house! NO! dont let her in what ever you do, shes dangerous he said!
