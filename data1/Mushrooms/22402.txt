I'd been planning this trip for about 2 weeks, as the weather report for Amsterdam had told me there'd be nothing but sun for my intended date. The day before, I'd gone to the Dreamlounge Smartshop on Kerkstraat, in the heart of Amsterdam, and bought myself 2 boxes, each containing 10 grams worth of Philosopher's Stones, as regular mushrooms (Mexicans, Columbians, Hawaiians etc) had been banned about 6 months earlier. Many unexperienced sources had told me these truffles were not as powerful as the now-banned caps and stems, but I nonetheless went with the word of my mentor, who had assured me the difference was minimal. Little did I know, I was about to have a trip much better than any I'd ever had on Mexicans and Columbians.
