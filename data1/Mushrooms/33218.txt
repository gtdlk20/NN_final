My whole mindset was fine and uplifted before the trip but heavy and morbid as soon as it started,  and all the visual effects were that of enclosing me and making me feel prone to a negative interpretation. It was a very dark windy night outside  last night of the year. I felt no desire to play with the trip much  or to experiment with reading books or playing music. I found that when I moved my head around it could affect things. So in that way I occasionally took control to change my experience. However nothing lifted the mood of this trip into anything enjoyable or funny or beautiful. The theme at all times was ugly and grungy and at times sinister.
