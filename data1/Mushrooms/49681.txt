The tension of downstairs hit me again as soon as I was halfway down the stairs. Fells was a huge help in finding my stuff and Tim and JamJar both really helped me to calm down. Rose offered to be a surrogate Jewish mother to me, which I hugely appreciate it although I couldnt react to it at the time. A taxi got ordered and I spent the last few minutes in the house talking to Fells, JamJar and KT, which did really calm me down. I wasnt hysterical. I was calm. Just not happy. I was uncomfortable.
