Me and four other friends, ate the mushrooms around 7:30 and then around 8:00, they took it's first effects.  We decided to venture outside and head towards the videostore, a mere 8-10 blocks away. It was totally frigid out side, around 30 degrees, so we bundle up, about three layers and head for the store.  So far things and going pretty well.  We're walking and talking, when we get to the video store and as soon as I cross the threshold, I'm catapulted into an explosion of light and color.  The videos are rumbling and seem a bit shifty. We rent 'the big lebowski'.  My friend is cashing out and I'm busy staring at the floor and it's swirling spinning. We venture out in the frigid cold and head back to my house. The walk home was interesting, every 5 mins, someone would honk are yell at us from cars.  Some people seem to have nothing better to do.
