4) 1 person.  Used the brown rice method.  Obtained initial print from FMRC. Typical success rate, 4-5 out of 7 jars.  Besides spore prints, has also used live culture taken from an active jar, and even dust from a bag of purchased shrooms, all with the same success rate.  (I guess this person emits some sort of sterile field that suppresses the growth of anything that isn't desired- no one else could get things to work starting from such a non-sterile source of spores.)
