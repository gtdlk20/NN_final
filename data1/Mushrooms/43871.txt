We got the fire pit set up and we put some sticks in the pit. I brought some paper and a lighter to help get the fire started. For the life of us we couldn't manage to get the fire lit and the more time went on the harder it was for me to concentrate on getting the fire started. I remember I was coming up and finding it hard to concentrate but having a little jolt of enthusiasm to get the fire started but I still couldn't manage.
