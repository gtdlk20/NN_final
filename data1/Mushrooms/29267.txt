And something did happen  I cant speak for A, but he told me later on it felt like he was having some kind of energy orgasms, something hed never experienced before. His hands started to cramp and got paralyzed, so did the left side of his face. He had hard time speaking, but at no point was I in the least bit worried  I had the utmost trust that what was taking place was for his highest good, and everything would get back to normal soon  as it did. While all of this was happening, I had some huge revelations myself. After all the fears I faced in the beginning of the trip, I once again found my trust in the Universe, and my trust in my own power  I had the most empowering feeling of being totally in control of everything without actually trying to control anything. I was just going with the flow, but still I could keep my own limits. I somehow experienced my inner goddess, and my truest inner essence, my inner healer  a limitless desire and joy to give, but also receive, as there needs to be a balance.
