K walked to the Waffle House next door. I didnt feel up to being in public, but as I lay there I started thinking about her and us, and my feeling changed very quickly. Suddenly I wanted to be near her, and going outside sounded nice. Outside I was seeing a lot of starburst which made the street lights very pretty. I ran into a guy who's living upstairs from K, and he started talking to me. I'm pretty sure he is schizophrenic. K had already told me about him and what a religious weirdo he is. He said K was totally crazy about me, which I was glad to hear, and I told him I'm pretty crazy about her. He told me the Devil loves him and asked me if I know the Devil. We had an ...interesting little talk. We probably talked five minutes and it seemed like he didnt blink his eyes once the whole time, haha. Then K was coming back with the food and I went inside with her.
