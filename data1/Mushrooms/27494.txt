Time was immeasurable on the Rock.  I learned later that we were gone from the cabin for about 2 hours, but it could have been 10 minutes or 10 hours and  I wouldnÂ’t have been able to tell the difference.  We laughed and laughed till we cried.  We ooohed and aaaheed and screamed and yelled and it was all fantastic.  We would lapse into introspective silence and then one of us would break the quiet reverie with an ecstatic scream of pleasure.  Eventually we were reduced to communication beyond words.  We would mumble sounds and noises to each other and communicate that way, without words.  My friend said something about the rhythm of the universe and started putting a beat to the gentle hum of the river around us.  I found myself locked into this beat;  every noise echoed in my head a thousand times.
