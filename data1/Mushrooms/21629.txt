I was lying on the couch and his dad asked me what I took. In my still blacking out stupor I told him vicodin, I have no idea why. The ambulance arrived and a few firefighters came in the room and I didnt know what was going on at all. All I knew was that there were these big men in uniform trying to control where I walked.
