At one time I got up to go stand in the hall, the hall felt very long and stange, I felt very out of place. I asked my friends if we could leave. Our only way home was to take the bus. It was definetly about -15C outside, and was so cold waiting for that bus. The bus came every 40 minutes and we had just missed it. It felt like we were out there for about 20 minutes talking about everything, but once I looked at my watch I noticed only 5 minutes had gone by. Then all of a sudden this car pulled us with a guy and a girl in the front and some guy in the back. They said they noticed us out here and offered us a ride. I said yes just to get out of the cold. So us three girls squished in the back.
