The fractal patterns from before had also taken effect of my mental processes, and I felt as if the shape of reality was some multi-layered multi-dimensional infinite fractal. It felt like my mind was a complex replication of many other minds within a single consciousness, and that within my reality were many other replications of itself, within every particle and spiral center of each fractal. Infinity went on in every direction, and I could feel the existence of other spatial dimensions beyond the 3 we know. It was all very complex and I donÂ’t think I did a good job just now conveying the feeling of it all in words. Our brains and bodies are not meant to perceive of such things, and our language has no means of expressing them.
