The second time, I was with a different friend, a female friend of mine, and we had been planning to trip for a few weeks since she hadn't experienced it in years. So we made the date and at the beginning of July, 2004, we got down to it. Neither of us had eaten much that day, and we both consumed 3.5 grams, followed by large glasses of orange juice. The first time, it had taken about an hour and a half to feel the effects. This time, owing to the lack of food in my stomach, I begin to feel the beginnings of loosening limbs, the first sign I was tripping. Since my apartment was nothing compared to the natural beauty we could be in outside, we decided to go to a ark before I was tripping to hard to drive.
