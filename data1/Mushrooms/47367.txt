These mushrooms and other varieties have recently become widely available in UK head shops.  I have had plenty of very good experiences on the standard liberty cap mushrooms that grow wild here and so was intrigued when I saw other varieties for sale.  My first experience with them was absolutely wonderful.  I felt very happy and contented with whatever I was doing, which was mostly wandering around the house or randomly flicking between TV channels.  The visuals were some of the nicest I have had - very bright and colourful, everything existing in 'sparkly rainbow land'.  I did feel a bit cold and achy but didn't seem to mind.  When they wore off about 4 hours later I had a bath to wash off the 'trip grime' that seems to accumulate every time I take hallucinogens, and went to bed to have a very satisfying nights sleep.
