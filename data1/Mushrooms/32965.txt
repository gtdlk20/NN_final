We further amused ourselves by reading aloud and laughing hysterically at the many different artistic and literary flyers on the walls in this hall. One had some kind of rhyme about Tchaikovsky that was especially amusing and trippy.  Anyways, we continued our exploration of the constructs around us, and the experience still continued to intensify and accelerate. I wondered if the logic and sense of reality would continue its dismantling forever, or would we someday return to what had previously been called normalcy? Time seemed to have no meaning, since there was no difference anymore between what was supposedly real and what not, so how could I trust that the sun would still spin regularly around the earth? But of course, I had forgotten it was, in fact, the other way around.
