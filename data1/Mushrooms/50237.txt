In the past, I can usually expect shrooms to kick in around the 40 minute mark, sometimes sooner if I'd smoke a joint too. On this particular night, an hour and 15 minutes had passed and we were all feeling tired instead of buzzed. My couple friends left shortly after 1:30 and my ex and I decided to call it a night and headed off to bed, our other friend was staying the night and crashed on our couch.
