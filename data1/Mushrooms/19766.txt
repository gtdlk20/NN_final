Salvia. Am I on salvia??? I wasnÂ’t sure. Everything started to seem exactly like salvia, and I had a feeling mushrooms and salvia were related somehow. This was making me very nervous, because I didn't want to be this fucked up. The Salvia universe was the last place that I wanted to go. Suddenly I just wanted it all to end. I wanted to know how much longer I would be tripping for, how much more of this uncomfortable madness I would have to endure.
