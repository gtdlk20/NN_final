We continued down the cave and found ourselves not in a futuristic environment anymore, but in the dirty depths of rock and soil, no longer illuminated by the florescent lights behind us.  We sprayed what I called the symbol of the Gods on some concrete.  This image will never leave my memory.  It must be about 2:45am at this point, and Brad springs the news upon me that he has to be home or his mom will be angry..or something like that.  I felt it was an extremely shallow, earthly commitment compared to the magnitude of what we were experiencing that night.  We made our way back to his house, safely thank god, and sat outside for a little while longer rounding up the rest of the time we had together that evening before he went in.  A car drove up to us, stopped, and then threw something at us.  It was the morning paper.  Never has a paperboy caught me so off guardthat guy got me so good.
