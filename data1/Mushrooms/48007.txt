We ingested the Thai mushrooms simply by cutting them up and chewing and swallowing them. The taste was mushroomy, not unlike the mushrooms you would buy at a supermarket. Shortly after this ingestion we noted a buzzing feeling in the limbs. This was a pleasurable feeling and we simply sat down and waited for the visuals to start. The visuals were much like we had experienced before with general movement in peripheral visions and more profound movements if we relaxed our focus. This wore off after a couple of hours and left us feeling clear-headed.
