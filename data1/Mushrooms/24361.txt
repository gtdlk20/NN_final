'Hey, you want to buy some mushrooms?' was the question that started it all.  It was later in the evening on a Thursday, and I wasn't planning on getting any, but I thought 'Hey, why the hell not?'.  So I got my money from the ATM and went upstairs to my friend's room to grab the bag.  My boyfriend at the time just happened to be up there too, which prompted the 'Heeey, you guys should trip together!' that came from our dealer, who was trying to get rid of his stash before he had to go home for break.  So my man said 'Hell yes, we will trip tomorrow!'
