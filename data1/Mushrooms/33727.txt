At this point my memory of time is a bit skewed. Lying on the ground staring at the sky I began to see a number of patterns. At one point it seems as if the clouds are in multiple layers and the top one is shaking back and forth. Later, I see an alphabet soup of letters swirling around, spelling nothing. I also remember seeing the shapes of horse riders and people beginning to coalesce in the sky, but they never fully take shape.
