My other roommate that was tripping did not have this out of body experience as I did.  I have come to realize that I am a little more sensitive to shrooms than most.  Having never taken more than 2 grams, I am able to always have very intense visuals and out of body experiences, but never to the point I was frightened for my life.  So my advice for those who like to take 4+ grams and have an intense trip is to prepare mentally for your trip, so when you get to that other plain of existence you will be able to control to some extent what you feel, hear, smell, and think about.  I know shrooms can be a very good tool to get to know your inner self, but always be prepared for the bad to happen and to have a good friend that is not on anything to watch you and help you if need be. Cause you never know what your inner self whatÂ’s to show you.
