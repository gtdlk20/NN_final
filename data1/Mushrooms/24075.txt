So I eventually detached myself from the door and its poetry, and returned to my friends, who were still enjoying what we had begun to call 'The Room.' I asked them, calmly but urgently, to come with me to the roof, to find something meaningful. Their response, that I remember strongly, was 'That they couldn't handle it right then.' Again, this hurt me deeply, though I made no comment on it, as I knew that they meant no harm in it.
