Once outside I enjoyed the trip thoroughly. I enjoyed everything. I looked at the ground at some point, and the black rocks in the concrete seemed like little bugs, slidding around on the cement. It was cool. I decided I could handle more. I picked up another eigth and split it with a friend. We also bought some marijuana and enjoyed that to. I handled it fine. The rest of the trip was quite pleasant, and I would definately do it again.
