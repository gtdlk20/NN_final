I looked around at my friends with a new sense of wonderment.  There was Jake, bowling my turn, getting strike after strike, and I believed my 'enlightenment' was giving him guidance to bowl a perfect set.  Kevin was a little anxious and aggressive, his trip wasn't at the same level as mine, but I looked at him and realized it could be if we would just make a spiritual pact to be on the same wavelength.  Tom was zoned out, tripping in his own mushroom universe.
