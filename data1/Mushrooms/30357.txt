I ate about 7.5 grams of what this dude called Treasure Cove shrooms (lmao) and smoked about a gram of weed during the experience. I tripped with a good friend of mine. So we got into his apartment and shut the door behind us (didnt want his roommates to know about this) and got the shrooms out. We ate them around 9 PM (me slower than him, ha) and then I rolled up a blunt and we walked outside. I smoked and we talked as our surroundings started to flicker with unnatural movement. We went back inside and sat down and watched JonTron and I started to laugh uncontrollably. I had this feeling that I had multiple faces on my head, all with different expressions like mad laughter in one, and anger in another. My friend walked off and then I was alone.
