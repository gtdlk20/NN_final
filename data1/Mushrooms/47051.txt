Eventually I wandered off and visited my neighbors for a second. 'Go to the northeast part of the property and there's another drum circle. Its better, more precise beat and more dancers. Its like the audience is more dedicated to enhancing the music than screaming and enjoying themselves beligerently.' That's what my neighbor said, I had no idea there was a 2nd drum circle! Not to mention better! I shook his hand. 'Thanks, Ill go check it out, Im looking at an all nighter! Peace brother.' and I took off.
