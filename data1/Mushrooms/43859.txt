Originally we had planned for it to just be Mitch and myself tripping with our mutual friend Max who we know from work trip sitting us. We hadn't planned this very well though so we pretty much told him that afternoon that we were doing it but Max said he wouldn't be ready till like 6. In my mind six would be way too late to do them because we wouldn't get to the camp site until like 7. At that point we'd be tripping at nighttime in the woods and none of us are very experienced.
