I stared around, a giant in the middle of a subterranian city, with a vail of stalagtites above my head which disabled me from sitting up on the bed, and a comfortable cloud I sprawled myself upon below. I didn't mind sharing it with all of my hallucinations, which were actually interacting with me/eachother quite profusely. I loved every second of it. I watched a clay person (refer to Tool's Schism or Parabola video) hop around innocently and point at things in my room, wide-eyed, like that of a small child in a playpen full of toys. At one point I actually brought my face down toward it because it enticed me to come closer. It reached a little smooth hand up and brushed my cheek. Almost immidiately I felt very cold. Not uncomfortably, or devilishly cold like the kind you feel when scary shit goes down, but a tingling, relaxing cold that washed away my earthly pains. Like my whole body was a third degree burn, and soothing water came crashing upon me like a wave at the beach.
