All of this was simply too much for me to stomach, but my ego was still connected to me (albeit in a fragmented fashion), and this alone served to relax me. I felt as though some sinister, cosmic black hole was slowly pulling away more and more of my ego, and that the only way I could remain sane was to try and simply *not think* about how my ego was slowly dying (I highly recommend this as a method of avoiding bad trips, but it should be noted that is a lot easier said than done). I managed to remain relatively calm, and in fact what finally ended up freaking me out was the idea of my parents or brother barging into my room (they were still awake!). With this in mind, I decided to turn off my computer screen and get in bed, so as to pretend that I was sleeping.
