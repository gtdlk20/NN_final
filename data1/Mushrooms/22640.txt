God Encounter- I thought in this state that I was truly dead in real life. I thought I had either killed myself or had jumped through a window while on shrooms and my parents and the ambulance declared me dead on the spot. I thought this mightÂ’ve happened when Quetzalcoatl picked me up and dropped me. I was a God in my own right, I would be free to gather the cosmos, but instead I hated this bit because this would mean that I would see or be seen by no one in my family or my friends the rest of my existence as a spirit. I was able to journey out of the Earth and into other planets to see other terrestrial life.
