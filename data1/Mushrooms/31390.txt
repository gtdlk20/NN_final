Ive been an atheist leaning agnostic my entire life. After this experience I feel like a true agnostic. And that feeling carries over to every aspect of my life, not just after life. I dont know anything about anything and thats ok. We are all just children pretending we have everything figured out. I am a very very skeptical person and I will never really believe what happened to me was real. Its just as likely to me that this was all a drug experience taking place in my brain. However, my two greatest fears were insanity and nonexistence and I had to face both of them. After this experience those fears have been greatly reduced. The thing that really fascinates me are the people claiming these states of consciousness can be reached without drugs, but by using only meditation. I think maybe thats where I go from here.
