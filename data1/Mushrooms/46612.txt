Eventually one of us reminded the other one what we were trying to accomplish. The mere bringing up of this idea of putting in the cd and how we had forgotten sent us into another hysterical fit of laughter. At one point P turned on the radio on accident and turned the tune knob wantonly to a static radio station. We stopped laughing and just listened for like ten minutes. Finally one of us managed to hit the eject button on the cd player. I don't know what happened to that cd, but when we tried to put the correct cd in (Tool-Aenema), we kept fumbling it. I don't know how it ever got in. We dropped it several times, laughing continuously. When the cd made its way into the player finally, we both just totally zoned out.
