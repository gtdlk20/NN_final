My boyfriend asked me why I loved him. I knew I couldnt convey it fully but I was also excited about the challenge. I told him that first that I loved him on a basic level because he is another human being. He shares the same triumphs and sufferings that I do. Seeing the vulnerability in his eyes, I quickly assured him that I also loved him as an individual. I said that I loved his excitement about everything and most of all, I loved the fact that I immediately could tell when I met him that he tries to be a good person. To me, trying to be good is all you can really ask of anyone. If they fail, then you forgive them because you know that you fail as well. My boyfriend decided that he wanted to watch a Phish DVD and was really disappointed to discover that he had left it back at his house. I told him that we still had another Phish DVD in my room. I will never forget the look on his face when I told him. He put in the Phish disc and turned and we watched several sets, including one of my favorite songs, Divided Sky. We talked about how this song represents the elements of a shroom trip. We also talked about the Phish community a little. He had a realization that he didnt convey in words that deepened his love for Phish. We thought it was cool to think about the fact that every time one of the band members thought about their fan base they were thinking about us.
