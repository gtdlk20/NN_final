About 15 minutes later, I went into the art museum.  I still couldnt tell if the mushrooms had any effect or not.  The art was all pretty trippy, and there was some weird-ass modern stuff designed to deliberately mess with your senses.  I got tired of that pretty quickly and left. When I got outside, I didnt even feel the level of effects that I had felt in Key West.  I just felt sort of dazed.  Like when I am coming down off of good marijuana, and I'm just kind of out of it.  I didnt have that heavy, stoned feeling in my head, though.  Everything was kind of glassy.  I had the same feeling of tingling and swelling in the back of my mouth, and my stomach felt kind of upset.  I was kind of bummed and frustrated, because I was really hoping for a big trip.
