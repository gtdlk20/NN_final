The night started off with me and 2 of my friends eating some chocolate fortified mushroom each with 3.5g of psilocybian. We went outside to look at the moon and the stars since it was night and the sky was clear. Everything in nature looked amazing. Trees without leaves seemed to be cathedral-like. The stars seemed to vibrant. Everything looked so much more beautiful than it really was. However, after our drunk 'mental' babysitter (to aid in our mental sanity) became too cold to remain outside, she entered my residence and began to play very loud mainstream poppy punk music. This disturbed the peace and we all started questioning existence from then on. The 'truth' was pointed out through some controversial discussion. While completely avoiding religious beliefs, we began to question existence itslf and what mattered. We all came to the conclusion that life is a giant waste of time and in order to pass the time, it is filled with diversions such as eating, sleeping, etc. We all came to the conclusion that life is a giant waste of time and in order to pass the time, it is filled with diversions such as eating, sleeping, etc. Anything to delay the inevitable mass extinction of many species on earth (including humans) due to humans. Obviously this wasn't a good thought, and we all started becoming depressed and apathetic about life.
