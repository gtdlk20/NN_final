(7:30) We get in line for a haunted house. By the time we got to the entrance, it was 7:45 and I just started to feel a body high. As we go through the haunted house it gets stronger and stronger. Although I was coming up, the attraction wasn't really scaring me. I knew this would be a good trip, but I had no idea how the night would turn out.
