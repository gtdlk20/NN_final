My cell phone alerted me of a text. It was from my wife. Where are you?  I could sense the concern. She was undoubtedly seeking her husband  undoubtedly bounding naked across the wildflowers on some Alice in Wonderland meets Dorothy wackiness. I was only a few yards from the cabin so I decided not to attempt a text back.  I was sensing we had reached peak altitude. I was blending even more. I scanned the grassy end of the pond and her blue shirt popped out from the Earthly greens. I felt the security of her closeness. I made my way past the cabin, down the incline of the landscape- past a couple of more cabins and then into a small woodened span that opened onto the narrow grassy path alongside one end of the pond.  She was glad to see me and looked me in the eyes (through my sunglasses) and her concern was clear Are you ok? she asked without saying a word. I smiled and looked around. Everything looked 3D  but not 3D in the regular reality way  but 3D like a 3D movie or one of those old baseball cards that came on the back of cereal boxes in the 70s.  I babbled something about the potency of the shrooms and how beautiful it all was. She asked if I was hungry. Sort of. I said ok and we headed back to the cabin. I was ready to go inside. I was ready and excited to do a McKenna.
