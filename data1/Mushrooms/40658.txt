I looked at a family photo album and pretty soon started to have an outflow of emotions. Lost track of time, and started having mild visual distortions (auras around objects, some flickering lights when I looked at the sunshine going through the window curtains).  A wooden door with glass panels looked positively screwed. Pretty soon, even the white walls had patterns to them. I looked at my own hands and they looked familiarÂ… yet strange.
