By this time the mushrooms were almost in full swing. Mushrooms are a full body experience, every sense is distorted and changed into something else. EVERYTHING moves. Sort of like being in a hall of mirrors at a carnival and watching everything bend and contort. The strange thing is that I feel my own body bending in weird shapes. I feel like a bubble in a lava lamp. We decided to go to our room and lie back on the bed and watch the show. When I got to the room, I was at the peak of my trip. It was around 1:00PM by this time, and I was flying high.
