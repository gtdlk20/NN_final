10:25 I sat on a step that put me in view of my whole backyard. It looked very beautiful and outlined. It was very dark outside but the moons light gave me an interesting picture. The next thing I remember is feeling extremely sick and shortly after, throwing up. I felt a lot better. I went inside to clean up, and then things started to get very strange.
