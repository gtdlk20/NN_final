Not two minutes later, as I was literally telling my wife how this turned out to be the perfect trip, my daughter began running through the house making this crazy noise. I thought I was back to tripping again but then realized she was choking on a piece of candy she had grabbed (This is exactly why it is important to have a sitter. this gets crazy and I am glad my wife was there. I do not recommend that people with kids trip around their kids or at least there needs to be a sober responsible adult there). My wife got the candy out and we all had to kind of breathe for a minute. What a way back and then the neighbor texted to let us know there was a tornado watch for our area. Then the storm started. Our older two daughters were out to a movie with some friends and we were expecting them back soon but now with the sky lit by lightening, wind blowing rapidly and rain coming in from seemingly every direction, we were worried about them driving, which wasnt helping me much. Shortly after it started, the storm calmed and everything seemed to relax a bit. I went to grab a banana and almost ate it. I saw that this banana, once peeled, had streaks of red and purple in it. Thinking that I was seeing things again I confirmed with my wife what I was seeing. Hows that? After my first trip I find a tie-dyed banana! I didnt eat it. Then we went outside to feed the dogs. The air was electric and cold. I could feel electricity in the back of my head and my neck hair was standing up. We live on top of a hill where you can see for miles and when storms pass or are on their way, we can watch them for sometimes hours. I watched one of the most beautiful lightening display I have ever seen and yet somehow felt as if I had just been flying through it. We opened the lid to the dog food, we found a chicken in there. With an egg. I couldnt make this up, that was my return from the far reaches of the universe
