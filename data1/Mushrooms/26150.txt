I think in the middle of the movie we went out and smoked the joint A had rolled, I always feel like I'm becoming one with the earth when I smell pot during shroom trips, and the feeling seems to intensify as I smoke it too.  After it was roached we were back in the living room and I was having hallucinations, seeing other people and hearing them talking to me, shit like that; actually it was just Z trying to ask me what I was going through, he scared the hell out of me.  We sit on the couch and they remind me I still have some shrooms left in my bag (they ate the rest of theirs during the first half), I just throw these back because I feel so gone already I don't even want to; we watched the rest of Bumfights during which I was so completely fried I had lost coherant thought.  With my eyes closed I would see these colorful worlds just draw themselves, with eyes open little lines would just spin off of things; I kept having visuals of mayan ruins and temples, the whole trip had a distinctively native indian (Aztec or Mayan indian) feeling to it, the gods voices that I mentioned earlier seemed like Indian gods too.  I had sensory crossovers as well, if I breathed through my nose I could smell the color green, and green fans would explode in my vision too.
