I found out that morning day before that my roommate would be gone for the rest of the day and that night, and I had been waiting to take my second solo mushroom trip. I prepared myself during the day by going for my daily run, meditating as I do everyday (but a lot longer today), and listening to some of my favorite music. At 8pm, I ate 4.5 grams of the best cubensis I have ever come across, washing the sacrament down with orange juice. About 10 min after eating the shrooms, I began to meditate, and continued meditating until the mushrooms took hold. I decided not to attempt to meditate during the trip itself, though. After coming up, I decided to take a walk, so I threw on headphones with the first CD of the album, The Multifaceted Genius of Ustad Alla Rakha. By this time the post-come-up mushroom trip was setting in, and I was going deep.
