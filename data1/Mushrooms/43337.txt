One thing all of us trippers had in common was that we liked looking at people. We camped next to a people highway of sorts. All the people coming and going would walk past us on this path. Peoples facial features were exaggerated. I recall seeing many people with stretched stomachs, legs, and arms. Eventually so many people were moving past me it seemed as if they were a river. The rivers source was in the direction of the stage and it branched right at our spot. A small stream of people went to my left while the majority went to my right, towards the exit. I stared at this river for a while until I realized the blanket we were sitting on was a raft and we too, were in this river.
