The rest of the trip was a lot of the same. I realized that my town was a very beautiful place, and that I took a lot of things for granted. I also tried to explain to T how we think things are 'official' and safe when really they aren't. I tried to explain how a package of ham wasn't perfect or anything - someone just decided to sell ham one day, and they just got some pigs and killed them and wrapped it up nice and sold it to us. I cried again because I realized that T and I would never amount to anything and that life was hopeless. Then T and I laughed at my crazy thoughts (I knew they were crazy at the time, but I felt so strongly about them that I had to tell T).
