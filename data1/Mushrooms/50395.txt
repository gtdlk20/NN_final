After some time I accidentally turned on the tv and started watching without understanding any of it. Slowly the power of the trip lessened and I noticed that my mind was returning to earth. After about 35 minutes of coming down in front of the tube  I was thinking clearly again and started to walk around through the house. I then got caught up in a incredibly powerful sense of euphoria. I had had this before while schrooming but never this powerful. It was a bit like a cocaine experience but lasted much longer, about 2 to 3 hours and very gradually subsided. I kept looking and thinking about everything with a overwelming sence of joy and appriciation. Especially the music sounded great. This lasted almost until I went to bed yet when it was over I developed an utter son of a bitch of a headache which lasted till the next morning and was thankfully kept under control by the use of 5 paracetamols. The next day,when the headache subsided there were no more side effects and I felt fine.
