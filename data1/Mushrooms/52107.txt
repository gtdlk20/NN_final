Let me begin by saying that I am a very spiritual person and have been blessed in this lifetime with a third eye with which to observe reality. Any tale of triptronic proportions coming from me may seem a bit far-fetched, but let me say that I'd been seeing visuals before I knew what drugs were.  I'm that kind of person.
