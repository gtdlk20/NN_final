The room is messed up, everything upside down. I want to take a shower but I'm too confused yet to remember how to do it. I decide to stop and clear my mind on the bed. After a few minutes I'm under the shower singing like MarilynÂ…  full of euphoria. Then I go back to the mirror. I feel good and I feel like I learned a new way of moving my body. I do funny things in front of my reflecting image. I feel like I'm more powerful and I can obtain everything from life. We go out for dinner, in our old world, with our new eyes.
