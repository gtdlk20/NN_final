Then, the main light got switched off and the u.v light got put on. That was incredible. Gingerdave had a bong that turned out to be u.v so that went a purple-blue colour. The water was doing fun stuff inside it too, just being a different colour. There was ice in it which went yellow. Something interesting from other trips I have witnessed is that trippers perceptions of colours are dominated by yellow. I saw the ice as yellow but loz and other people not on Shrooms saw it as more green. Then when he said he could see it was green, it looked green to me. Thats another thing about Shrooms, you are very suggestible.
