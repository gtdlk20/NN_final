We had been walking down the street with the intension of reaching a patch of trees that I had seen in the distance. As we wandered down the street past abandoned business and bars, I realized that we would never reach the trees. Suddenly, I noticed a beaver dam sitting in the back of an old parking lot. We walked toward the alleged dam, which turned out to be a pile of old, sticks (I guess that's a dam). An old man walked out of a nearby bar and looked at us strangely. I suddenly became anxious as I had the feeling that we had done something illegal.
