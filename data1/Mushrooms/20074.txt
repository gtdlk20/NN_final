I am an undergraduate college student.  My first experience with mushrooms was during Spring break of 2003.  I ate mushrooms 2 times, 2 days apart.  The first session was mild and almost unremarkable; I only include it for sake of completeness.  The second was very strong and intense.  It was a wonderful and unforgettable experience, which will have a profound effect on the rest of my life.
