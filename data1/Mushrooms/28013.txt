Eventually we got all snuggled up and I could feel and smell him and kept thinking about how we were people with whole lives that existed outside of this trip, separate lives and together lives. I thought about the last 8 months wed spent getting to know each other and how we were going to come out of this on a whole new level. I thought about my life, going over memories, seeing how all those things made up who I was. I had the sense that I had done this before, or that things were unfolding according to a plan that I had known all along. Yes, of course - this is how things are supposed to go. Then I would remember that it was only his second mushroom trip, and think that however many times I had tripped before, nothing compared to this and how special this was. Something in me just kept saying, This is important. Hold onto this. So often with him I have felt that things unfolded perfectly between us, at just the right time. Ive had the thought meant to be about him a few times sober, and this made that feeling really profound. I couldnt stop crying at how beautiful and happy everything was. I finally felt like the wall had come down in me. I remember thinking, This is your life. You need to start showing up for it. I could see how much I have been holding back because I was afraid, and translating that into apathy and withdrawal from the world. I felt like I really needed to start participating.
