The sense of losing my mind became increasingly apparent. Whats the difference between what I experience inside my mind and what is occurring outside it? I wondered. Is my entire reality a figment of my imagination? Will I someday wake up to a completely new one where I have been labeled clinically insane by my family members? I decided that if this were so, then there was nothing I could do about it, and I allowed myself to let go completely. If I am crazy, so be it. I am still here, and nothing can change that.
