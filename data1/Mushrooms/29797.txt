As I write this it is October 2014. I have had several opportunities to repeat these experiences, but have been in no hurry. One of the remarkable things about LSD and Psilocybin is that they are not habit forming. But, if you have had a good trip you may find that you want to replicate it. DonÂ’t do this expecting the same experiences. You may be disappointed. You can return to the same place, but always seek new surprises.
