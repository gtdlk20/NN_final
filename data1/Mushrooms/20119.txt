For those who are interested, I wrote down some thoughts while I was on that overpass, and I present them here.  Some of it is redundant with what I wrote above, and some of it is unclear to all but me.   However, I present it unedited in its entirety, because I feel that it is a window into my deepest thoughts at that moment in time.
