I got home around 5:30ish. I cleaned my room a bit, and took some posters down I thought might not be good for a bad trip (giant Jolly roger flag, posters of characters from warcraft, pictures of dragons, geek stuff ect.) I ate half of the eigth at exactly 5:48. They didn't taste too bad, only like slightly musty regular mushrooms. I ate them all within two minutes. I cleaned a bit more, and then sat down to play Guitar Hero 2 until they kicked in.
