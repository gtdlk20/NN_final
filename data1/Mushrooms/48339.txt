After returning to my shelter, I dove into my sleeping bag, and proceeded to have a very enjoyable time, mixed with some intense periods of reflection about my experience.  I have learned to trust myself more, that thoughts, however seemingly helpful or satisfying, are ultimately ephemeral.  Being grounded in the moment and doing what feels right deep inside, even if it is inexplicable at the moment, is what will lead me through difficult times.
