When I come back, I go to my girlfriend. She gets lost in smelling things. Our scent is so strongÂ… too strong, like animals. She has a cranberry lipstick. Wonderful! Then we kiss each other, trying to speak but we start repeating things with no sense. It's so hard to communicate, because our timing doesn't match. I feel her female body, but sometimes I really don't know who she is. Probably some other female images overlap with each other. We would like to make love, but visions seem to be more interesting. We are too distracted.  I go back to bed and get naked. My nudity gives me a weird feeling, every detail surprises me. I lay down with my eyes closed, I focus on body sensation. I feel the weight of flesh, it's consistency and materiality. Like an anchor keeping me down, preventing me from flying. Then again colourful visions: lights, luminous wires interweaving.
