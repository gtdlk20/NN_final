We got up and walked over to the group of people who were standing in front of the stage, dancing and bobbing to the music. We were all getting sucked in by some invisible force. I started knowing the answers to the world and it was all seeming to come to an end. At that same time I felt that everyone there was thinking what I was thinking in my mind, and I heard them all. We all thought with one collective mind. I looked up at the main singer on stage and we made eye contact, I then heard him singing to me and telling me to even come up on the stage. I looked at my friend in disbelief and he only smiled and nodded. I then looked at someone else in the crowd and me eyes made contact with a beautiful women and she only smiled and nodded. It was all too much. I wondered, 'how could this all be for me?' Then it occured to me that it was all for everyone. I then realized how beautiful the life we were all living was and the mistakes that we made as a human race that was going to take it away from us. It was the most exillerating moment.
