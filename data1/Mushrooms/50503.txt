The trip got way crazier later when I jumped from rock to rock until I sat on a boulder in the middle of the river and observed a more violent part of the flowing water.  From the middle of these rapids rose a small rock, which, if you use your imagination, had two green leaf eyes and a yellow leaf mouth.  After spacing out for a while staring at it, I became aware that it was, as crazy as this sounds now, communicating with me.  It was more angry than anything I have ever seen.  It hated me because I was human, and wished I would die so that the nutrients in my body would feed the earth.  I know this must sound completely retarded now (it seems stupid even to me), but at the time, it was completely real.
