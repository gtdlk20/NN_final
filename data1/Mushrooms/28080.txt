Suddenly my pjs and my headphones felt very foreign and uncomfortable. I was also definitely peaking, I was very high and becoming aware of how much I was in for. The small bits of movement from before I laid down and listened to music were pretty dominant when I opened them again. Everything was super defined. Patterns.. movement all my art I had in my room was just going wild. I could also just feel everything on my body, constricting, pinching tight and uncomfortable even though it was just some loose pjs. So aware of everything that was in contact with my skin. So I took off my clothes except for my T shirt I was wearing. Headphones came off as well and I managed to mess my hair up and it felt really nasty. It's not a nice feeling having hair tangled especially on hallucinogens. So I got up and went to the bathroom to grab my hair brush contemplating what the hell hair is all about and why I have so much of it and what do we need it for anyways? Serious life questions.
