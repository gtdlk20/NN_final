It begins with the afterimage of lights on the eyelids slowly morphing into eddies of dull colour monochromatic patterns. The images gradually become more geometric and fractal. They are continuously moving and start to pool together and bleed into each other. Like mini production lines of Escheresque optical illusions. They are happening all over the visual field. I can zoom in and out and they are replicated at each different level. The images begin to be accompanied by recurring sounds, flipping and swishing, bouncing around my mind. I hear wind rattling windows outside. Find it mildly irritating and put earplugs in to attenuate the external sounds.
