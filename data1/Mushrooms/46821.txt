As the mushrooms started kickin in, we giggled to each other and talked about events back at school. The breeze was very cool and soothing - I felt like I was constantly being caressed. But as we were getting lost in our giggles, I noticed something that really frightened me. I couldn't see the ocean at this point because the night was so dark. I could only make out objects that were very close to me. On this island though there was a lighthouse. I didn't notice the beaming light until this very moment, its ray circling the island and showing us, only in strobed seconds, the crashing waves, the sandy shore, then ourselves. It was a constant rhythm that really intesified the trip. So what really frightened me was that when I saw the beam illuminate the area by our tent, it showed the tide closing in on us only a few feet away.
