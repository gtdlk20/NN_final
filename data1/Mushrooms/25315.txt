T-0:30--We trot further back into the woods and everything becomes more and more funny. I already begin to get the lightness in the chest and that intangible tingle along my shoulders. My hands feel as if they are only attached by strings to my shoulders, and my head sort of lulls. At this point I start to feel slightly nauseous, but I can easily ignore it. We also find that our hand-eye coordination is greatly improved. We can throw the hacky sack we have as high up as we want and catch it no matter where it goes. Weird.
