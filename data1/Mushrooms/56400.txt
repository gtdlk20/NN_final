I woke up to a cold splash on my face. It was seattle, he asked me if I wanted to play X-Box for some reason. I shook my head, the outside world moved to the music in the background (shpongle). The lamp beside his TV literally danced. It took a bow. Then I picked up the xbox controller and walked to the couch and sat down. Somehow I was starting to exit my state of terror, I almost felt... Good!. WAIT I FELT GOOD. I threw aside the controller, and went to find Goober so we could talk some more. I FELT HAPPY! I eventually found him in the kitchen drinking tea. we sat outside, and talked about our adventures while smoking Djarums. Eventually we came down.
