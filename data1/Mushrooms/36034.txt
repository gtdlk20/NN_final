Finally, we got in the car. As we left the city, there was a cop who had pulled someone over with his lights flashing. I remember it looked like fountains of red and blue sparks were arching up from the lights and it was really intense. Once we got on the highway, I remember looking at mountains I had seen for years like I had never seen them before. I was in total awe of how beautiful they were and asked if they had always been there. There were a lot of forest fires at the time, too, so there were beautiful whisps of smoke all around the mountains.
