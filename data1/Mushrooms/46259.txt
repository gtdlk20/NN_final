At around 11.15 in the morning I took the mushrooms while in the city. I was with my 2 best friends Tim and Cathi, my friend Esther and her boyfriend Dylan and CathiÂ’s friend K. The plan was to head to the city Aquarium (AQWA) while tripping and since they take around 2 hours to kick in we dropped early. Only Esther and Dylan were also tripping with me.
