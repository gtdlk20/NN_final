Al was stuck in a grocery store ranting about Hondo. He started talking about how things used to be before computers. There was a big old west scene that I barely remember. Al proceeded to throw one of the registers at the un-breakable glass and it hit him in the head. I was laughing harder than I thought anyone could laugh. The show ended and I decided to go take a leak. I was staring down at the toilet and it slowly turned in to a giant toilet spider. It grew eyes and a mouth out of the back and sprouted green and black legs out of the bowl.
