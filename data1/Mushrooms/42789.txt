In this so-called modernized, western world, we all seem to have this certain image about ourselves that were unconditionally open-hearted and tolerant. As a society, were delusional that were welcoming to virtually anybody; that were open to all races and religions. What a load of shit. Discrimination is still clearly evident throughout many parts of this great land. Race, religion, and gender are just a few areas of discrimination, across a long list. Anyone with different opinions from the group of majority in power, anyone caught deviating from the social norm, and those from different socioeconomic classes are always treated unfairly.
