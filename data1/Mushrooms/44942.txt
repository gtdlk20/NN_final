We chilled in that room for ahwile and then ended up on my friends upstairs porch at 5:15 (I remember checking the clock) to finish off the last of the bud by ripping some more bongs. I looked up at the sky and the sun was coming out and it was this beautiful light blue color. The clouds were still making patterns! We went downstairs, both toasted half a bagel, which I ate in my bed and went to sleep.
