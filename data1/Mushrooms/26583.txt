I kept seeing branches bend at INSANE angles, like trees would practically be touching tip to root. Me and T dosed another chunk and a half. Me and T figure we had level 3 visuals, B was approaching level 4. He has juvenille benign nightime epilepsy and is taking a bunch of meds for it, so it's possible that one of those upped his trip. As well, he got much more of a stone than me or T because that was his third time smoking weed. That was our third time that day :P.
