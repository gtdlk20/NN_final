We had 4.5 g dried of Psilocybe semilanceata, and took roughly equal doses.  I made sure I was no longer stoned from some canabis smoked earlier as I wanted to fully experience the coming up.  We kept brewing the shrooms with tea in a saucepan until most of the psilocybin was consumed.  We then chewed on the remaining shrooms.  The brew did not taste as bad as expected as the taste was covered by the tea.  Our trip begun in an abandoned caravan just off site.  After the brew I started to feel strange and light-headed almost immediately.  I think my friends were coming up faster than me though, as their pupils were already huge at this early stage.  They had become extremely energetic and violent towards the caravan and had begun kicking at the old metal.  One of them had begun shouting 'You cocksucking motherfucker you!'  (his little phrase for the entire of his trip!)  I could feel myself coming up properly now and just lay on the old matress laughing hysterically at my friends.  The caravan appeared to have enlarged and become a huge hall, and the cracks in the floor formed intricate patterns, like celtic crosses.
