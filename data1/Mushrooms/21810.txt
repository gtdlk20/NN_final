We were on a small island, completely alone. The tent was set up on the white sandy beach and driftwood gathered for a camp fire, which was built but not lit. A tangle of trees comprised the island's center.  We planned to enjoy the shrooms aboutâ€‹ an hour before sunset. We both ate very little earlier in the day.
