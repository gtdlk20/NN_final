We didnt go far when Akmed starts having a really hard time breathing (he is smoking a cigarette) when he says that every time he breaths its nothing but smoke then he collapses. At this point I dont even know what happened to Lucifer and Im just with Akmed on the ground trying to figure out whats wrong when he says 'FUCK I'm HAVING A FUCKING BAD TRIP FUCK'.This whole time Mcmurfy is just watching like what the fuck and Im just trying to comfort Akmed by telling him that hes gona be alright and thats its gona be just fine. Then he starts begging me to take him to the hospital and wake up my parents and shit and Im just like 'Im sorry man but I just cant do that, its all in your head man, u gota get a hold of your self, I took the same amount you did and your bigger than me and you just gota convince your mind that you have control over this shit like me and you just gota have your mind over it man!' And the whole time Im there with him its like I stepped into his mind and was witnessing what he was seeing and going through, almost as if I stepped into his trip. And he is about to cry and is begging me to get my parents. So then I just break it to him straight and tell him that Im not going to do that and that its all in his mind and that he is just having a bad trip.Then I tell him that he just has to get it into his mind that he isn't gona let a mushroom fuck with him and he has to literaly put his mind over matter. And me and him both know what caused this to happen, one cigarette and because of this he quit smoking.This whole time my dog is scared shitless and is really worryed, I could tell just by looking at him. And then I remembered my last trip when I did an 8th and remembered how just my house cat put me in a really good mood and decided that maybe an animal's presence could cheer him up, but it was no good.
