I was well enjoying myself at this point.  I felt great, and all the small hallucinations were excellent.  However, things started to take a bad turn.  As I have mentioned, none of my friends had tripped before either.  I was very aware that I was on my own, and although I was immensely enjoying it, I didnÂ’t tell anyone else what I was experiencing.  I was also thinking thousands of thoughts a second, and when the thoughts were most intense, it became difficult to communicate.
