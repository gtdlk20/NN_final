And so i walked on, coming to the center of the golf course and noticing in the moonlight a white object placed in the middle of the course. I walked closer until i could make it out, then stopped in bewilderment. It was a muskoka chair (adirondack chair for you yankees) placed, oddly enough, in the middle of the goddamn golf course. What purpose would it serve? I suddenly realized it was there for me. I was to find myself in this chair.
