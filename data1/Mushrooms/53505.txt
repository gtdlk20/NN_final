Another thing I noticed was the unity of the whole place, it was as if people's minds were forming a great mass above their heads, filling the whole place. It was a 'combined mind', but like the real brain, it had many different parts. Each person was a separate part, but a section which work with others to produce the overall effect. This is the power of the place, and the reason why the whole experience is so different from anything else: your body is not important there, it's what you are thinking that's vital. The people who come in and don't let their minds and spirits go are the ones who don't enjoy it. If you don't let yourself become part of the experience you cannot enjoy what is happening. You have to let yourself go to understand what is going on.
