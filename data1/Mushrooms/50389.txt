I've been taking mushrooms for about 1.5 years now and I fell in love with them since the first one I took one. In Holland where I live you can get I kinds of good quality dried mushrooms completely legal at the smart shops. [Erowid note: Dried mushrooms are no longer legal in Holland] I've always thought that I was pretty familiar with how the mushrooms change my perspective and the way I think, but what happened a few weeks ago was quite something else.
