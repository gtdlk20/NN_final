It is safe to say I grew up tenfold that night, it opened up my artistic ability. I finally understood the concept of when drawing something, to not look at the whole object, but disect it and draw the lines. Those lines form the object on the paper. I thought I understood it before, but somehow afterwards I was able to visualize images in my head better, and transfer them onto paper. Before I viewed a tree as a tree. Now I understand because of that tree I am able to live, it provides me oxygen. But at the same time, it depends on me to water it and help it grow, protect it from the storms, tying it up, making sure it stays rooted in the ground. We are interdependent of each other, just like any other thing in this universe. Black holes cancel each other out so galaxies holding other life can continue spinning and moving on with time.
