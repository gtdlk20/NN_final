- Felt like I finally, deeply understood myself (or accepted who I am?) - why I was drawn to certain interests, experiences, people, why so many people with extreme emotional baggage are drawn to me, that Im peoples emotional safety net for those deep places they dont usually want to go to, that are usually blocked in the physical world by their insecurities. But with me they could be okay to let themselves just experience them without fear, why I shouldnt get so upset about people draining me of emotional energy (because Im the gateway for it, more on that in the spiritual journey section), why I felt the need to be creative and do everything and pursue everything in every way possible. I was finally able to fully, truly experience all of these extreme feelings that have been going through me for the last few years, that this is what it was like to let them overwhelm me but I obviously couldnt do that in real life because it would be completely debilitating (maybe it wouldnt  be?).
