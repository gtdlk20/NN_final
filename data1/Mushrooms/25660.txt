12:35 A.M. - At around this time, things got weird. We began melting into each other and we both stated how we felt like we were in a dream. It felt as if we were out of our bodies watching this whole scene from a distance. TRIP noticed that my arm which I was leaning on looked quite distorted and I just laughed and told him not to worry, my arm was fine. We began looking at the Alice in Wonderland poster which we had bought during the previous week and we noticed the creatures popping out of the poster. This was an amazing sight to look at. We were both mesmerized for quite some time. We looked at all the various posters in his room and noticed specific features and colors in all of them. The colors in the posters looked as if they were flowing like rivers. TRIP began telling me how everything he looked at looked furry. He said it looked as if the walls were growing hair. This seemed weird to me because I soon noticed the same effect.
