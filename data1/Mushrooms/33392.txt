We decided that we should just chill out by the lakeside. At the end of the lake we were on, we sat on a picnic table that had a view of the other lakeside. People aren't really allowed over on the other lakeside, so it was rather overgrown with flowers, weeds, and more greenery. It was beautiful. It looked like they were growing and flourishing upward and outward for our entertainment. It was like they knew how we were feeling, and they were just as happy. I found myself staring down into the lake, following a branch that seemed to descend into a dark green nothing.
