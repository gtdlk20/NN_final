T+01:30ish - We reached the tourist area and marveled at the unusually large size of the empty parking lot.  The stars appeared to me as a spacey purple color, and they twinkled like never before!  We ran around in the parking lot for a while, then found a massive pile of wood chips next to the parking lot.  These wood chips had been mulched from the dead foliage collected by the forestry service weeks before, and were shaped into a large path that allowed access of a bulldozer, which sat dormant near us.  We explored the bulldozer and found that the front part was an excellent place to lie down and watch the trees move.  W decided that he was not going to be able to find his other friend that night, so we then ate the rest of the mushrooms (mostly stems) there in the bulldozer bowl.
