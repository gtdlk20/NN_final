Discursive mind - A lot of content here. Lately I try to deal with an overly analytic and highly discursive mind through meditation. I try to observe and disconnect from thoughts. But I began to appreciate here a major misconceptualization on my part. It cast some doubt on the need to approach meditation and stillness from the perspective of silencing that mind. I struggle to find the right words for it, and hope to explore this more next time.
