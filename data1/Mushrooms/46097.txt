We all started talking like madmen. Everyone wanted to sort of slow down the trip, and wait for our bodies to digest the psilocin. This was sort of funny, because we would burp every now and then and taste the juice, which is always an indication of digestion, and thus is good news for those concerned, haha. What I usually tell people who are concerned about never coming down is Do you have a digestive system? Okay, well then you're going to come down. At this point, we were slowly coming down off the peak, but everything was still wild and confusing. At this point, it was fairly early, about 11pm. Two of my buddies had plans to go meet up with their girlfriends to watch the ball drop, and were planning on how to do it. I kept suggesting them to just stay the night at my house, and not to put themselves in danger with having to drive and possibly getting pulled over. However, they felt guilty about neglecting their girlfriends, and were contemplating an array of methods in getting to them. I didn't want to get sucked into their madness, but in a room of six trippers, how could I avoid it? We all started talking about what they should do and all that, while the rest of us had no real responsibilities or place to go, and were content.
