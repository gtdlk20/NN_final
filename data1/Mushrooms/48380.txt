This was overall a 4-5 hour high from just 0.5 grams that were split between 3 people. When I pay $10 for 3.5 grams of these p. cubensis indoor-grown mushrooms, it's well worth it to eat 3 grams of them for the oral mushrooms experience, and then I'd suggest (at a different time) to smoke the last half-gram in a bowl or mixed with weed in a bowl, to yourself, and not with other people, for a very different and enjoyable high.
