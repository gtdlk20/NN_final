I thought of writing it down, and warning people to set themselves up to be completely undisturbed and near a comfortable bed for five hours, before reading my report. I thought they would all get high as they read it, and have the exact same experience, without needing to do any drugs. And that was really cool to me, that people could have this experience without needing to do drugs. I thought it would spark in them the realization that they, too, exist and do not exist simultaneously, and that life is an extraordinary gift. The best gift of all actually because it means we get to experience being alive, being in love, being all together in water and in unity, even if its all illusion.
