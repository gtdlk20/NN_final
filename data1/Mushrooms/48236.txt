There was much more to the trip than I have said, those are only the events and emotions that truly hit home. It was an amazing journey into another world, created by my mind and altered and developed by the mushrooms. I would never advocate doing an 1/8th for the first trip, but once you work yourself up to it or more, I think you will find that this world, and your mind, truly has something magical to offer.
