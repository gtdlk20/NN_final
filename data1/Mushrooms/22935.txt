Thinking about larger issues than my own personal struggle reminded me that in response to a Reddit comment, someone had replied, 'I'm sad you're an Excel monkey. Your words could change the world.' It was uplifting and after washing my hands I set out to go read the comment and reassure myself that it really happened. At that moment (and in so many others) I felt a need to know that I was much more than my individual struggle. I wanted to know that I could affect people the world over despite my own difficulties with love and the struggles with my parents. Knowing that you're contributing to something beyond yourself helps alleviate the little deaths of heartbreak and loneliness that so pervade my waking moments.
