All of the sudden I found myself laying in the dark wide awake. I couldn't close my eyes for the life of me even though physically, my body was very tired. It is important to note that the walls of our room had recently been painted. They were starch white with no photographs on them. As I looked around the room I could see a crack of dim light from under the door. My mind instantly convinced me that I was a patient lying in a hospital bed with my twin brother (my ex). The year was 1952 and we were 12 years old. I knew that even though I couldn't sleep I was to stay in my bed quietly. I thought about getting up out of bed and walking around because I was so bored and even thought about walking down the long hallway.
