The first visuals made themselves known as the bending of different objects in my room. My bookshelves, TV, and dresser all bent into curved-looking objects. When the TV screen would go black I'd see little red and green sparks of electricity on the screen. The last visions I got before a long lull was that my dresser seemed to be very uneven looking. It looked as though it was jetted very far out from my wall, and that the panels were different sizes than normal.
