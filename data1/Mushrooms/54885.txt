We got up early (10:00) on that day and he came over to my house. We ate nothing beforehand so the mushies'll effect us faster. I got some lemonade to wash them down with. (citric acid supposedly speeds things up) We toasted our mushies and ate em like theres no tomorrow (12:00). Personally, the damn things didnt tase so bad...
