Ha, ha, ha, ha. Look at my roots, I feed off the soil and the rain. It is alive also. We all must eat to live, it is all part of the cycle of life. Only when you exploit my family and I for your own commercial gain are you cursed. You where once me. You cameth from the soil. At one time you where composed of only one cell. Now look at you. You have trillions. But each cell is independently alive. Ha ha ah ha! Man! The kings of the planet. Ha! Your people have forsaken us! Look what mankind has done to our home. Come cut me down! One day your race will have killed us all. That day you will have to pay to breathe! Ha! The tree scoffed.
