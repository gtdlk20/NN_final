The increasing negativity of my experience seemed to flow through me like a horrible current, electrifying my body with more strength each second. Frantically, I tried sending Nick another message. I could barely get to the place where I could compose a message. I tried in vain to say something to Nick, but I failed. All the while, every time I pressed a button on my phone, a faint beep was emitted from the speakers. This became the phone's voice, and it began to speak to me in its language of beeps. My phone was very disappointed, and it was almost mocking me. 'doot doot doot doot doot doot,' it said, jabbing its finger at me. 'You know you shouldn't have taken mushrooms, you silly boy!' The phone reminded me of some little child who didn't understand the world, and was simply parroting what it had heard from the media, its parents, etc regarding drugs. I connected this with my mother, who I often think of in the same way when it comes to drugs.
