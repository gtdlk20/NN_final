First I noticed light visuals and the usual way everything looks 'different'. I saw the carpet doing some odd things, already more intense then my usual light trips. As I'm watching the movie I start to notice that nothing they are saying makes any sense. It all sounded like jiberish to me. Occasionally I would make out 1 or 2 sentences. I could hear them perfectly, in fact I think the shrooms made the TV sound louder than it actually was. They would seem to be talking normal but instead would say something like 'Frudkin malusk binfurd dorra?'
