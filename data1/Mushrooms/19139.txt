I realized my nose was stuffy, and I needed to blow it. So I felt around until I managed to find my pants, knowing I had kleenex in the pockets. Getting the kleenex out of the pocket, or even finding a pocket in the pants, was proving to be too much for my bemushroomed consciousness however. I kept turning the pants over and over, and each time was foiled. They seemed to be twisted and knotted up in strange ways, and I couldnÂ’t for the life of me untangle them. Finally, I decided to share my problem with the others.
