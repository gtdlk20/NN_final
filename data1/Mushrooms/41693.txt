Earlier this year, I learned that mushrooms where going around my area. I was intensely exited to hear this and really wanted to get some, as I had never tried them, but had experimented with various other drugs - mainly pot and alcohol, a long period of using dxm, a few different painkillers, adderall,  2ci, and two failed attempts at acid.
