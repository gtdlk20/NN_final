T+2h18m: This is now like the tail end of any mushroom trip. I can feel when it turns a corner in my gut and things get funny for a little while, then I fart. Woot. Feels very much like when my sister and I ate the chocolate shrooms once gifted to us, actually. Things are a little surreal, but Im fully functional. Wonder if Ill be able to sleep tonight. Hm.
