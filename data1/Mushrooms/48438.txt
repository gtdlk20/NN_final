I wanted to find the meaning of life, I truly believe it would make me normal again.  I sifted through ideas, maybe it's love?  So I thought about my girlfriend, that helped a little but I couldn't remember anything about her except what she looked like, not even having sex a few hours priors to taking the shrooms could I remember.  I then thought that maybe being sober is the real life, and that by me tripping I went against what God has meant for us, but I quickly realized that it was not that.  There had to be a way for me to figure out the meaning of life, and I believe I came up with something but I can't remember unfortunately.
