A moment later, I was back in my human body, in my bedroom, and my sitter was asleep beside me, and the music was coming from an electronic device rather than from everywhere at once. I found that I was able to blow my nose. I noticed that I needed to pee again, and was surprised to find myself crawling to the bathroom. I watched my hands placing themselves on the floor, one after the other, and wondered how they learned to do that, because they certainly didn't get it from me.
