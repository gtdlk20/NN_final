I came to with my glass smashed beside me and with L and J standing over me. They told me not to move because of the broken glass but I felt an incredible need for fresh air. I half staggered half ran to the garden before collapsing once again to the floor, but as the fresh air entered my lungs I felt my mind clear. Eventually my stomach cramps receded and fatigue rose to a point at which I felt able to sleep. I awoke the next day with a headache and a 'washed out' feeling. I was the only one of the three of us to experience these negative effects and I'm not entirely sure what caused them. I will never try truffles again because of a mixture of the bad taste and lack of visuals.
