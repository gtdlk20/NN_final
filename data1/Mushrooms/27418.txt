The 1st step down, after 3&1/2 hours of peaking, was an instantaneous knowing of Who, Where, and What. The effects were still very strong, and I began to want a break of normality. There were a couple more subtle yet instant 'drops', but each time I found I was still tripping pretty large. M appeared to be becoming paranoid about how he was coming across to me. We dealt with this uncomfortable phase for 1/2 an hour or so, then both seemed to reach a plateau of understanding.
