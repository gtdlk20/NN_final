We eventually got indoors and I was still enjoying the trip. In fact, the best part of it was during this phase when I was on my own. She went to bed but I stayed up to enjoy as much as I could of the remainder of the trip. At this point I was aware how late it was and that I had to be quiet. I did lots of things to amuse myself. Again the television featured and I found a late-night programme where the presenter appeared to me to be a chicken. He was annoying me by sitting and talking when I wanted music and a visual feast.
