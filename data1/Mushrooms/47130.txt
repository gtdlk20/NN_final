We started to peak as we all came to a stream, with a small bridge across that we all sat on.  This is  the point where the intellectual happenings started to happen.  We discussed everything from poetry to Socrates.  One of the most intense feelings that I felt was the cycle of knowledge and acceptance.  I would always come to the conclusion that we should just accept the world for what it was, but then would think again about how knowledge is so important for intellegence.  We all experienced this cycle of how the world was comprised.  I definitely had a loss of self, but then regained a sense of self many times.
