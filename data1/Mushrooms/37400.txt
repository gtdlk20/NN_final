On the bus home I noticed my pants shifting like waves in the ocean. Once I was home I was very cold and excited. I put in a cd and listened to 'the pixies - where is my mind' and if youve never heard it, its good. After about an hour and a half being home I started to get VERY depressed. I was crying like crazy. I thought I had an intence trip, boy was I wrong. I guess that they had a very small amount of Psilocybin in them.
