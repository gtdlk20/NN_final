At about 7:45 I was feeling the first fingers touching out to me. We were outside, hitting the bong, when Rhino put on the music. I had never liked The Beatles as much as some people, but it sounded right tonight. The music was somehow much more interesting than it usually was. It was around Feel Good, Inc. that I really started to feel a difference. I felt like the music was coming in waves and gently pushing against my face. The music seemed to awaken my brain, and pull it out of a sleeping state.
