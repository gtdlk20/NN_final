Now, toward the fourth hour after ingesting the mushie-laced chockies, and as I purposely stayed raised on an arm in bed with eyes open, I felt a very different condition. I was very much in a strong trance, thinking being somewhat difficult; you might say I was stoned, but I reserve that word for other drugs that make you feel stupid and lethargic. I felt a powerful tightness in my face and head, as if all the muscles were tensed and rigid. It was then that a realization came to me, that this was the culmination. This state felt special; I can only come up with the thought that this was a mental state in which anything was possible. I believed that reversibility thinking was not only possible then, but easy. Those familiar with the writings of Joseph Chilton Pearce will know what I mean. I felt that this was the mushroom's crowning grace to humans. This state of mind.
