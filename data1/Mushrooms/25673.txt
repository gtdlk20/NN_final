3:15 A.M. - We had the feeling of waking up from the dream which we had inhabited for the past 5 hours. It felt like we were waking up from a long sleep. P guided me down what seemed to be a familiar long corridor which didnt really exist. He kept telling me Come on, Its time to go home now were going home. This is when I woke up in the opposite bed once again. He came over to my bed and we discussed our trip. We were coming down, but still noticing the orange haze and flying colors throughout his room.
