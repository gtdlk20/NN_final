At around ten past 8 I started to feel a body buzz and the walls began to breath a little but that subsided after a few moments. I then laid back to relax for the come up. The come up was a little bit awkward but the body buzz was really good and I had a feeling of euphoria. After about 20 minuets I put on my headphones and began listening to the song 'rubber world' by local syracuse band Ted Eddison. They are incredible. Anyway, I definately experienced the time dilation thing as mere moments of the song seemed like entire episodes or events. I can't really say that I experiences closed eye visuals, but I had these strange and lovely daydream experiences. I have vivid daydreams anyway, but these were tinged with colorfull psychedelic accents. I felt a split in my self at times. Part of me felt completely sober while another part was free to play and daydream. Part of me felt completely sober while another part was free to play and daydream. I realized that this wasn't entirely true as I got up to go to the bathroom and every time I saw my reflection in the mirror I thought 'this fucking guy again.' Whenever I had that thought I would chuckle. The effects subsided a bit around 10 am. I listened to 'inward journey: east and west' by Joseph Campbell. It was enlightening and funny at times.
