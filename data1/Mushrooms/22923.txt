Before I retreated underneath my blankets but after I'd taken off my clothes, I stared at myself in the mirror. I'd come back to looking at my reflection a couple more times throughout the night, but the first thing that I said right then was, 'This is how I look' and asked myself if I was happy with it. I wasn't. My upper chest is too small, there's too much fat around my abdomen, I have wrinkles across my face and my eyes look dead and unfocused. Several people have told me that I'm movie-star gorgeous but I don't really believe that. I do believe that I can change my appearance drastically and that brought me solace. It doesn't really matter what I look like or whether I'm happy with it if I can become another person at the slightest whim. Rather than focusing on my appearance, what I have to do is accept myself as a whole. I am so much more than my body. There are ideas, actions, and ways of being that all belong to me and combine to create Zubair. I don't know exactly where the boundaries of self are located but I know they extend beyond my fluctuating six-pack.
