I didnt realize how much of an effect environment can have on a trip. Constantly thinking about bad things will take my trip in a downwards spiral while happy thoughts uplift me into the clouds. Im not sure Ill trip in a public place again. I am however looking forward to a combination of mushrooms + mdma, maybe eventually acid if I can find it. This trip has again opened my eyes and expanded my brain. Ill definitely do it again.
