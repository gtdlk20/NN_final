Now I cant remember how that little scene concludes. The next scene gets bit ugly and shameful. It needs telling though so here goes. I find myself on the floor in my shower cold water is running but I am trying to stay out of it. I am acting, no I am playing a character or in a character or a character is in me. It is a caricature a farcical cartoon. I am acting out depravity, I am being the very essence of everything that you dont want yourself to become. I am certifiably insane, completely disgusting and the most disgusting thing is I like being this way. I find myself pulling hideous faces. (Thankfully I avoided the mirror.) I just cant stop doing it. I think that I can stop any time that I want to but I dont I just keep going. I dont stop because I like being this way but I also find it repulsive. I think that I could stop but I never do so maybe I couldnt.
