The Trip: I sat and ate 5g at my computer desk as I chatted away on msn, general ranting, and a discussion with some friends so they knew what I was attempting and to exercise a little caution, but just to know that I had some background protection, as Id chosen to trip by myself to avoid any possible social anxieties. Not that Im the type to get social anxiety easy at all, but people tend to distract my thought patterns when I have to change the direction of my thought to communicate properly. My ideas so commonly dont convey easily into English when Im on a high dose of psychedelics.
