We ditched the tickets and headed to my parents house boat.  I know, trust me, that you're wondering how I kept my bearings - it just felt natural but I also understand it wouldn't have been an excuse if I killed someone while driving on this, sorry.  Anyhoo, we parked the boat in a wooded cove, let down the ski and cranked Crystal again.  The moon was full, the water black as tar and the air perfect.  I thought I was Jesus for a while, floating in the water, secured to about 8 lifevests.  We drank a few beers, laughed like never before and music took on a new definition for me.  The night lasted about 13 hours and never did I have a 'bad' or scary time.  It was simply incredible.
