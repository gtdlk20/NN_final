I had just gotten over the flu a few days earlier, and I was sort of worried about my temperature.  I felt very cold, and then soon very hot.  After a while I started to relax.  Things that happened were extremely funny, much more so than pot, and i had to leave the room a few times because i was laughing too hard.  I hadnt really taken enough to hallucinate, but simple patterns in walls and carpets stood out and seemed to be flowing like water.  My friend on the 4gs told us the next day that he was constantly hallucinating, but couldnt remember what was going on.
