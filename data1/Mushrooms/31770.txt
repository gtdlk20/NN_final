Occasionally I would remember my life and beg myself to hold on to every detail so I wouldnÂ’t lose my mind and myself. I would look over at M and say his name and then I was say my name, trying to hold on to any details about my life I could remember. But all I could remember were our names. I felt like an alien, never before seeing this world for what it truly was. I looked at M and saw all of his strange facial features as if from a new pair of eyes and realized that humans were really bizarre looking creatures.
