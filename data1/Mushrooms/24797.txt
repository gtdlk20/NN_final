I donÂ’t really remember the walk across the field, but I do remember approaching the house.  I sat in the grass under a shady tree.  D stood there for a second and then said he was too hot and had to go inside to cool off.  I sat there and looked at my leg, and something about the way it looked made me realize I was really tripping.  Then I looked at the grass and saw it in a brilliant green, and the dandelions in brilliant yellow.
