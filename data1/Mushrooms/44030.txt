We went for our 2nd nature walk, this time down his driveway. This was peaceful we started to talk more about our psychedelic experiences and although not with much mutual acknowledgement of each other's words, we laid in the grass and stared at the bog that was west of his driveway, across the bog was a forest, it called me, I knew that was a place we needed to go, I told him we needed to go across but I don't think R heard. We headed home, acknowledging our incapable state. We returned to our previous loop of needing an action. The constant exchange of needing to do something eventually ended with someone saying, 'Let's go smoke some weed!' so I went out onto his lawn with him on a picnic table. After R had entered the house in and out several times over to either grab rollies, weed or a lighter I grabbed my beer and smokes from the porch and lit a cigarette.
