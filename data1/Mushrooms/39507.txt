At some point RP went back to the music area, and I was sitting at the campfire kind of off by myself feeling stupid for getting my expectations up over a drug.  I don't know if I made a comment to HC (hippie chick) about being disappointed by the experience...but for some reason she got out of her chair, walked over to me, and discreetly handed me about 2 grams of mushrooms.  she said 'i hope you get something meaningful from it.'  it felt like fate.  I said 'thank you' and then ran off to consult RP.  He told me that if I felt comfortable with it that it shouldn't be a problem.  So I ate up, bringing my cumulative dosage to appx 3g.
