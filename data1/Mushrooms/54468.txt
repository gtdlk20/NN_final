Ultimately, it is not the most relevant or important thing to know what exactly happened or how, but what the experience itself was.  Or perhaps it is equally important but the message of this particular experience is exactly that: stop analysing and thinking, stop trying to put the Mystery into a box, stop reasoning yourself into the smallest possible particle, because when you do, you completely lose track of yourself, of what you are, what you can be, what you are capable of and the simple joy of being.  A joke loses its fun when it is explained.  Qualia are not secondary  they are primary (heres looking at you, John Lock and his admiring Carthesians).
