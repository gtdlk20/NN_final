As I was coming down, I asked for some crayons and paper, and drew/wrote some frantic things, trying to communicate the things I hadn't been able to communicate all night. Talking about the 'responsibility to reality' and stuff like that. At some point, there were almost no visuals, but when I finally went to bed they  came back. It was a relief to know that I was 'back.'
