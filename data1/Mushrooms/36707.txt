My visuals had persisted though I couldn't pay much attention to them, my eyes were not important to me anymore over the new telepothy I had discovered; nevertheless I noticed that while I watched a wall I would see the movement of energy speed up and erode it away entirely in seconds, the energy my mind was sending forth was incredibly, it was everywhere and both my friends could feel it.  Throughout the night their attention shifted to me many times; I would suddenly hear voices calling my name and I could feel the psychic energy of my friends turn to my direction, at one point I was playing guitar and had intense musical energy that wouldn't let up, my friends had been talking and they suddenly noticed me, I heard them saying I was lost in my own world and that I was really playing from the heart.
