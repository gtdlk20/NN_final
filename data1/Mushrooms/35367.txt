Over the past year I had acquired a morning coffee habit and has been drinking alcohol a bit excessively. I had been weaning myself off these nasty things for the previous month or so and had just finished a week of raw foods, juices, herbs and internal cleanings. I had also been more involved with my yoga and was re-attaining some of the higher levels I had reached in my youth. Things were looking up. So Sunday night about 9pm I had walked to the grocery store for some breakfast granola. As I was standing in the parking lot I decided right then and there was a good time to trip. I had the next day free, it was finally warm outside (it was april) and my energy level was up. Walking across the parking lot I consumed about 1 and a half to 2 grams of fresh P. Cubensis. Yum yum.
