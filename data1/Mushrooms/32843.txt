The night went on, and I continued to have all sorts of fantastic visuals and amazing philosophical + mathematical epitomes. I think the one mistake I made with mushrooms was the fact I chose a social party setting to take them in. Mushrooms are an extremely introspective drug, and although I feel I should have a sitter at all times to watch me and make sure I don't do something stupid, it's definetly not something I want to do in a party or social environment. Next time IÂ’ll use them in a private setting with a few close friends. I can most definetly say I will definetly eat shrooms before I attempt to write any sort of philosophical masterpiece!
