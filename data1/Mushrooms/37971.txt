All in all a very worthwhile chemical for tripping, dancing and being very alert all at the same time. Best bit was the visuals in bed on the first night and the truffle combination on the 3rd day. On the down side, I did feel a slight aching in my joints and muscles and my body did not feel as supple as it normally does when dancing, hence the DMT use at the end to remedy it. I have a suspicion that this one will go very well with other 2C's and am looking forward to meeting DOI in conjunction with others in the future. I just wish there were some more festivals to go to this year.
