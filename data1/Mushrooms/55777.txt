No worries. What a beautiful night. We started out at about 11pm, smoking and just watching TV. Eventually, I went into my bathroom alone with a candle and just started meditating. I watched the candle explode into a flower with infinite rainbow petals. I closed my eyes and watched the flower become impossibly intricate. I started thinking about how words and numbers and even colors in the real world really fail to explain all the things we want to explain. I started thinking about how everything is just an excuse, an inadequate explanation for what we really want to do/feel/see. I felt reality fall out from underneath me...just crumble in a spiral under me. I followed the sprial down and around and suddenly...there it was.
