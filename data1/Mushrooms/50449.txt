as I lay in my bea flying in space Im often pulled back to reality with the image of my friends screaming that something terrible has happened, I go to see what is wrong and I see myself dead.. And suddenly I wake up in bed realizing im still here, this happens repeatedly, until I open my eyes and see the pattern of time and space. All that I see is divided into different dimension, its like a giant gridlock and all I have to do is choose my destination... after this I fall asleep, for round about an hour.
