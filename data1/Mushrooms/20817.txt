I felt that perhaps I was giving this sound too much attention. I felt rather silly and began to turn off my laptop and lights to take on a more quiet and dark setting suitable for what was coming. I sat up in my bed silently listening in the dark. I whispered into the darkness that I was ready. After a while the sounds stopped it was here. I began to feel fearfear of what? I stood up and opened my closet, withdrew my marijuana pipe and consumed deeply. I sat down in the dark again, I felt better, though now I decided I better take this lying down. I laid down in silent darkness and closed my eyes. Then I began to dive.
