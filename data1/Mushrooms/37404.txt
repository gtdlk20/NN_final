I waited for her game to end and we consumed one chocolate each. We decided to walk along the train tracks and smoke a blunt that I had. The marijuana wasnt very good, we both got a little buzzed. We were climbing up a very steep hill covered in leaves when I noticed I felt like I was climbing a mountain and it felt as if it had been hours. Once we got back on the street we decided to go back to the school to take the sports bus home.  We were very giggily and we couldnt controll ourselves. Then it hit me.
