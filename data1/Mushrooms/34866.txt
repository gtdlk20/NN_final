And then writing became too much of a task.  I'm not sure how much time I spent in this odd hallucinatory world, but let me try to explain what happened.  I was definitely uncomfortable throughout the first hour after taking the tea, mostly mental discomfort.  I kept trying to search for a moment in which I could return to sobriety and think clearly for a moment, but everywhere I turned was something else to trip out to.   I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and face, and I noticed my hands would just not stay the same size.  It felt kind of like when I look at something through hot air or during a dream where everything is wavy and doesn't maintain its shape.  The 'wood' pattern on the door was also shifting like liquid and a painting of flowers I have hung up in my room seemed like it was dancing.
