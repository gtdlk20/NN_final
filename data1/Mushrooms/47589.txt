I was out of breath, I thought I was dying. I thought I was losing my mind because now I couldn't understand anything. Everything was too complicated. I was sure no coming back was possible. I thought nobody had been that far on shrooms. I felt I did not had the right to do this to my loved ones who needs me etc. Mental and moral torment. But still, I tried to hold on relying on what I had read online from other shroom-heads: relax, you will be ok in a few hours, etc. And eventually this phase ended up. I knew I was out of trouble and back at level 3: I could enjoy the beauty of geometric patterns with eyes closed.
