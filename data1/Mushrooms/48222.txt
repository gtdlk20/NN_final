The true hallucinations didnt start until I noticed peoples faces and the general color of things shift. Faces were now a yellowish haze, but I could still perfectly see peoples faces. By this time, I think we were in King Hall, and I was talking with N about tripping. He apparently likes to too, which is awesome. He seems to be very down to Earth, and asked me how much I took. He seemed to be shocked that I took so much and regained composure. He told me about the newbies trying a bunch and freaking out, and I replied that Ive done it on many an occasion, and loved it. After this I looked to the left, and aside from things generally jumping up and down from the walls and stuff, I could see the familiar double vision of Aztec like patterns. This time, however, it was much much more pronounced.
