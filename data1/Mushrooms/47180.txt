Machines are difficult to understand while on shrooms. The telephone was objecting, it was beeping. I played the 'And all that could have been' DVD by Nine Inch Nails (my fave band) and it was absolutely amazing. Everything sounded and looked better than normal. I just couldn't believe how amazing they were. Time was really strange too. I don't know for how long I've been screaming on the floor, it must have been three hours. The overall trip lasted for approximatly 6 hours. I never experienced anxiety during this trip, because I knew it would ware off in a while. Sometimes we looked at each other and we were like: what, in heavens name are we experiencing. And we still talk about it to this day on.
