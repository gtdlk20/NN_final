There was some construction item draped with a black tarp below us and we caught ourselves staring at it.  Eventually we labeled it as a big old moo cow. I thought it looked kind of like the grim reaper.  What we found inside of this unfinished wing of the hospital was undoubtedly the ideal situation for a first time mushroom trip.  Seemingly endless chasms of shiny silver lines walls, EVERYTHING was metallic.  Magnificent spikes of steel projected from the ceiling like we were inside a cave from another planet.  We stumbled upon an entirely full bucket of every color spray paint, every can full to the brim.  We each grabbed a color, Brad sprayed the color red on his black sweatshirt that created a mark I thought should have been on the sweatshirt in the first place.  There was a number 3 on a concrete box, and I sprayed the letters r3al on it for some reason.
