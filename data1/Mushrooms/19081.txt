Once I got into the bathroom, I felt the presence of an entity. It was either the same one, or one of a similar kind, that I have contacted before through DMT. I feel it is the entity (or one like it) that I used to call my Psychic Chiropractor, as he would show me how to move my body in ways I didnt even know were possible, with the gentlest of guiding touches. Today, he encouraged me as I sat on the toilet to take off my socks and pants, and put my feet flat on the ground to give better contact with the earth. I took off my shirt and sweater too, and naked the way I came into the world, I put my hands on the ground and lovingly released from my bowels, giving back to the earth. The entity remained with me, approving, hovering somewhere overhead unseen. I could hear him though, making these tones, kind of low humms and haws, almost machine like. Its worth noting that this entity seems to communicate telepathically. Although I would translate his communication into english for my own ease, he was definitely speaking straight to me and not using language it the way we understand it. After I had finished my business I thanked the entity for his presence and friendly help, and then made my way back to the round room, carrying my socks which I hadnt put back on yet.
