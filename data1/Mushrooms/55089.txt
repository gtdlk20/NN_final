That moment was when something clicked for me.  I smelled my body odor, fresh from our long walk.  I smelled the faint odor of my shit.  I was crouched in a fetal position, lightly holding my knees.  I felt newness, fear, overwhelmed by colors, smells, sounds.  I was wet.  I realized then that we are born into every moment.  The music that makes up the vibrations of our atoms swells us into existence in every breath.  I will always be confused, and afraid, and joyful, and new.
