For the three months prior to this experience, I had been taking small, barely threshold doses of liberty caps 2-3 times a week, interleaved with a slightly higher dose every two weeks or so where I took an evening aside to write and think about any issues and thoughts that had arisen. Dosing in this way has been undoubtedly useful, reconnecting me with an appreciation for life lived in the moment. Although happy in my atheism and comfortable in my rational materialism (for want of a better description), I have started meditating and incorporating forms of spiritual practice into my everyday life.
