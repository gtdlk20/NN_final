I wonder what it is about spiders that produces such a primal reaction of fear. Is it because they are so alien to us? Or is it because they've been so deadly to us in the past that our ancestors developed an instinctual repulsion to them? Either way, they are beautiful creatures. I would have never said so before, but experiencing so many spider motifs during my trip changed my opinion. They are beautiful because they produce such a strong response in us. Very few creatures can cause grown men to run in panic. Very few creatures can successfully coexist with humans in our cities and yet still be a danger to us. Spiders are terrifying. Spiders are beautiful. I'd never want a spider near me except in ink.
