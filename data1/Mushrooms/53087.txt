My friends then picked me up and said that we all should go for a walk. Suddenly, my whole trip flipped upside down and I felt great, like a million bucks.....a billion bucks. The world had never been better, and I was ready to do anything. We all went into the basement and danced like crazy. It was great. I was seeing the sorroundings perfectly, things were spinning, I was just great.
