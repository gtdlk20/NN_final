	That is when things really started to get fun.  I could feel myself merging with the ocean, and could feel myself as I washed onto the beaches of Japan in endless waves.  Just then, the lightning flashed, and brought me back to where I was, and I felt like I could feel an electrical charge go through me when the lightning hit the water.  Thinking that perhaps this was not such a good idea to stand there, I started walking back to the growing campfire where I could hear drums and singing and guitar.  It took my by then tripped out friends and I quite a while to get back, as we had to maneuver around the many large sand snakes, which I realize no to be logs.
