T + 2:00 Looking at the glitter, it was everywhere. It brought a glow to everything you look at made it give life. As we go outside we felt the flowers and trees. I realized how plants do not mind when I touch them, or eat them, because that is what they were meant to do. Just as everything I do I am meant to do. An amazing thing to think about, I am connected to everything around me. There is a little spot in my oneness for everything and everything has a spot in their oneness for me. We all have different talents of ourselves which make the whole, which make the (can be called anything but oneÂ…) God inside everyone.
