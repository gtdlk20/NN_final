After switching back and forth for a while with my new friend whom I could barely hear because of the roaring of the drums, he looked at me and said, 'Sing for us.' Now that tripped me out for personal reasons. It made me feel like he could read my very being like an open book. Because I am a writer of poetry naturally and I have been constructing my own singing voice without the help of a tutor and music and singing and writing the essence of music is the most important aspect of my daily living. And the thing is, I am a really good singer, everybody agrees I can mimic Maynard from Tool's voice really good depending on what tone of voice he's using and I can scream just like SOAD. Most of all though, people like my voice because it has a harmoniously unique quality to it.
