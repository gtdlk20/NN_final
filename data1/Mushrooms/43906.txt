But I can walk away proud of myself because it WAS very disorienting but I handled myself well. filmed a bunch of the trip and watching it back when I was in the throes of a psychedelic experience I actually looked surprisingly calm and mellow. So if I can survive that relatively anxiety free I can do anything else.
