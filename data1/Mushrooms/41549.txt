My vision then rose up out of this landscape and I could see the whole thing again but it seemed to go on forever and that the shapes and colors represented everything in the world, people, trees, buildings, water, rocks, time, distance, language, touch, shared emotions, everything alive and dead.  Everything was overlapping and in constant movement and interaction, I could not think a thought or move my arm or talk to someone without affecting the entire landscape pattern and vice versa nobody in the world could move or talk without it affecting me.
