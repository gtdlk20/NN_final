Not soon after that did I have a death of my ego.  I curled up in a little ball next to Bard and weeped.  I don't really remember that part, but Bard told me about it.  I remember after that though, we hugged each other non-stop for 2 hours because it felt so good.  I learned so much then.  I learned that the energy around us is so great, but we never stop to notice it.
