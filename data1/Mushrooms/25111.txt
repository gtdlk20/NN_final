When I awoke I was still under the influence of shrooms but not as bad I began to get sense of what was happening and what had happened and that it was all a bad trip. I grabbed 2 packs of ciggerettes. All my friends asked me if I was ok since I passed out for a bit I said fuck you guys and left the room as fast as possible. The second I reached the lobby floor I lit up a cig and enjoyed the soothing feel of tabbaco.
