We decided to go back to my friend's place because his parents were out for the night and because he had a game system we could trip out on.  So we get back to his place, divide up the mushrooms onto some chocolate ice cream, and dig in.  We then played some games and watched some tv for about 45 minutes to an hour.  No one felt the 'shrooms coming on yet, so we went out to smoke some weed just to get things going.  After a medium sized joint and a full bowl, we went back inside to play some more games.  I grabbed a coke, went downstairs and sat down on the couch.  It was just shortly after that I felt the 'shrooms kick in.  There was about a minute of the 'things are different' feeling and then everything started to go wrong.  I felt like I had to get up, but my vision was starting to go dark.  I got up off the couch, feeling very strange.  I tried to make it to the stairs but I hit the ground about halfway up.  I woke up with everyone in the room standing above me, yelling my name.  My nose was bleeding and I had no idea where I was.  They helped me sit up against a wall while I tried to stop my nosebleed.  I still had no idea where I was, and I was wondering why everyone was still looking at me.  I told them I was alright, and that I just needed to sit down for a bit.  They were all freaking out because they thought I was going to black out again, I was pretty pale and I couldn't really move yet.  I had to ask for some blankets because I was really cold at this point.
