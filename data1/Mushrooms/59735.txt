Oct. 15  The first six cakes to enter the terrariums all have little white beginnings of pin head all over them.  The first three cakes even have a few pin heads with dark red tip, some standing a Â¼ off the top of the cake.  I touched one to turn it, with just two fingers as lightly as possibly, within minutes, there were dark blue finger prints on the cakes.  I will be dosing this weekend, either Saturday or Sunday night.  All of the remaining cakes from the second batch (11) are showing signs of growth with no contamination.  Things are going as planned and better.
