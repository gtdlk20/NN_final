After the others finished eating Tim wanted to go to the toilet so I went with him to locate it. After an intense run there which I managed to avoid getting distracted he went inside and I waited for him outside. It was at the point where I met the most amazing, beautiful and coolest creature on the earth. It was a medium sized red and white fish which while seeming normal had one difference, it could walk. This fish had 6 whiskers which it used as legs to walk around the tank floor. It was amazing to watch and I came to the conclusion that it was the most perfect creature on earth, as well as being the evil eels enemy. I felt as if IÂ’d met god.
