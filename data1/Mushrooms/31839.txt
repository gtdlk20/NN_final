It was about that time that I noticed mushrooms beginning to grow everywhere  out of the tiles, the floor, the ceiling, the taps. I looked at my own body and noticed that there were mushrooms growing out of my limbs as well. This didnt alarm me in the slightest  being an experienced tripper I didnt freak out, rather I thought it was pretty neat and decided to see where it would take me. At this point I began noticing the fog, which I had felt I had been aware of in the living room earlier too. And in this fog, figures were moving, people were walking. It felt like the boundaries between this reality and another had broken down, that they had begun overlapping. Because this was the first time I had experienced this I decided to be cautious, and made no attempt to contact or get the attention of these people. Some gave me a cursory glance before walking off, and they didnt seem malicious, but I didnt want to take the chance on our first encounter. I went back to looking at the shrooms growing on my body.
