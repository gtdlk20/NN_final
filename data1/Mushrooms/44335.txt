About and hour later, ian and I were watching fear and loathing in las vegas (the ultimate drug movie) and I glanced over at my smashing pumpkins poster on the wall, it appeared that the letters were moving around, getting bigger and smaller, it seemed to be sparkling.  Again, my walls looked amazing. I looked at ian and started laughing, he said my pupils were really big, even though he had only eaten half of what I had eaten, he said the effects were coming on pretty strong for him. And thats when my night took a turn for the worst. I started feeling overwhelmed, when I burried my head in my pillow, it looked like there was another world inside of it, the shrooms fully kicked in while my face was still in the pillow. When I finally lifted me head up, my room was just one big blur... This is when the psychological effects started kicking in. Everyone says shrroms are like LSD minus the paranoia.  But believe me, this was nothing like acid. I felt like there was something else in the room with us, I couldnt figure out what it was though. Then I realized, it was the light.  There was a radiant light coming from the corner of my room, it was telling me to show ian how to see it. (whatever that means!) I started blacking out. I felt something grab me b y the shoulders, it took me a few minutes to realize it was ian.. I told him I didnt think I was going to make it, and even if I did survive this terrifying trip, things would never be the same for me.
