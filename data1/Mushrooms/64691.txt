About 2 and a half hours after after eating the mushrooms, we were finding ourselves coming down, and of course, no one wants to end a good mushroom trip.  I had heard about smoking mushrooms, but was unsure if it would work.  It took my a bit to convince my friend to try since it's a common rumour where I live that if you get the smoke in your eyes, you'll go blind.  I thought this is ridiculous, but we were careful to close our eyes anyways, just to be safe. After the first couple of hits, I found my self quickly going back up.  It was night and remember everything looking like it came out of final fantasy 7.  Even though I was In the neighborhood I'd grown up in, nothing seemed familiar, it all seemed changed some how, but I don't think I could possibly describe this change.  Words don't exist for that.  I was very confused, it didn't trigger any visuals, but the body high I get when mushrooms just kick in was very strong.  It only lasted about 30 minutes or so and made me feel VERY ILL.  It also left me very mushtarded and made everything I ate for the rest of the night taste like smoked mushrooms.  This is a very bad taste.  Another of my friends tried this the next day, but didn't eat any first, just smoked them and said he didn't feel any effects.
