My third time shrooming was quite intense. The first time, I ate two grams and had a mediocre, happy, childlike trip. The second time, I upped the dosage to seven grams (having been a regular user of LSD for three full years before ever eating of the shroom, and usually a big dose, too) and had an exhillirating, virtual earthscape of a spiritual mindtrip.
