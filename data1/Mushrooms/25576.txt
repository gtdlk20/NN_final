Sounds dangerous eh? But these tracks are for a novelty steam railway which doesnt run in the evening. We ambled down the tracks on some errand and he talked about how he felt and how cool the sky looked, as soon as his attention was directed elsewhere he relaxed just fine. We were followed by my partner and another girl (they needed a proper toilet) and our resident lunatic Ache. The sun was setting when we reached the car park and I was fully tripping and discussing something really odd with Ache when strangers came upon us. Immediately I changed my demeanor and topic of conversation in an act of camouflage, I appeared normal for them. I was surprised at the ease with which I dealt with the outsiders, on all previous trips I had freaked out regarding sober others couldnt deal with them, Since Balla lake its so much easier dealing with sober humans. In my tripping state sober people now seem trapped in behavioural patterns and self concious, I feel pity for them and amusement at the situation.
