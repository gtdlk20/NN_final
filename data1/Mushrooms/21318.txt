- And finally, again, the feeling that stayed with me most is the knowing that this place exists, that I have access to this place that is really difficult to get to because our subconscious is layered with walls when were kids (i.e. ego), that it can only be a secret until others discover it, i.e., theres no way to talk about it in the physical world without people thinking youre crazy, its not something to explain anyway, and that when I returned to the physical world all of this might actually be a narrative my mind has woven together to explain the experience, based on my own conditioning, but also equally feeling like its not a fictional narrative at all.
