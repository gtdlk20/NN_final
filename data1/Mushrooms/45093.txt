Then in my friends room I found myself staring in her closet at the corner of her wall without a shirt on just looking at some colors that werent even there..then my friends come in (the ones that arent tripping) and they are like 'Oh my god, are you ok?!' and all I can say is 'You Have to do this' I go to look into the mirror and I dont think my pupils have ever been this huge..they took over the green color of my eye and all you could see was a spec of green outlining my pupil. I go outside to hang out with some other people that are over and I was smoking a cigarette, and it felt so weird to inhale the smoke and blow it out of my mouth.  Then sitting in a garage my trip slowly began to come and go, and I knew that it was wearing off, I had dreaded that moment ever since the beginning of the trip. But as I came back down on the same level as everyone else, I began to think 'what the fuck went on tonight' and I remember telling someone that 'I dont even remember what I told my parents the night before.' I couldnt remember anything, not the friday at school, even though it had only been about 14 hours ago.  It finally wore completely off and things slowly began to come back to me and all I could think about was how amazing my night had been.
