After a few minutes, #2 returned from his run. All three of us were filled with so much joy! It felt like ages since we last saw him. We embraced and talked for a while. #3 suddenly got very excited when she remembered that there were blunts in the backpack that we brought with us. The three of them smoked the blunts (I couldnÂ’t due to my job). We all had fits of laughter soon after that lasted a very long time.
