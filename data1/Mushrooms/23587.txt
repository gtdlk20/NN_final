Lying there, my universe having shrunken to the dark, cold, damp tent around me, I felt despair.  I had no-one and nothing good or warm or dry in all the world, and I never would.  I had lost the ability to objectively analyze my situation -- to make the obvious conclusion that soon enough morning would come, the clouds would break, the sun would dry out the world and chase away the dark once again.  I crawled over to my backpack, found my iPod, and listened to music to try and calm myself.  It was scarier not being able to hear what was going on around me (namely, the constant, unchanging sound of rainfall), but eventually I shut my eyes tight, got myself lost in the music, and drifted off to sleep.
