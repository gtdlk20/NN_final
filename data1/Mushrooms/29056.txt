It's at this point that things get really fuzzy. I don't really know what happened next, or the order in which they happened. The sun must have been setting around this time, as it seemed to be dark in the tent. I must have peaked, as it was at this time that my mind finally left my body behind. I took off on an epic journey into the cosmos, through the very fabric of the spacetime continuum. Both time and space ceased to exist, I did not have a name or any kind of identity, and the question of 'why' no longer mattered. Everything just was. I don't remember what 'it' was exactly, but it was unlike anything I had ever experienced.
