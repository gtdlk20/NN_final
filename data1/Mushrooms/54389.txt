Now, it cannot be understated just how incredibly old and knowledgeable plants like the Ayahuasca vines and Peyote cacti are in evolutionary terms and the mushrooms well they have traversed the multiverse and have seen a LOT and have gained a certain cynical view of it all.  But it keeps seeking as much as we do: it is ultimately as clueless as we are about the bigger picture.  So together we stumble through the multiverse, the blind leading the blind.  That is my experience.  A blind God, drunk on power, yet traumatised by his inability to actually know what is going on.  And when you look at the infinitely nested fractal structure of the Cosmos, there are infinite amounts of gods just as there are infinite amounts of opinions on how it all works.  And indeed, as a lifeform living off death  rotting matter  its view is that of death and decline and its gods are those seen in Alien movies and Aztec art  Death as a boundary, not life as an emerging principle, which instructs high dose trips in a very morbid way.
