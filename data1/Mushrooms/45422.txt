My intention for this experiment was to take a small amount to check out their effectiveness. The overall intention is to try and gain a sense of connectedness to this land which is not my native land.  In the US I can travel all over the upper northwest quarter of the country and up into Canada and feel like I belong there. I can feel the landscape. Being a rural person, I have always felt this connection. Subjectively speaking, it seems that psychedelics have deepened this feeling connection, but after 5 years here I still feel alien to the land. I was hoping that the truffles would help and they are the only thing available anyway. This is a boozer country.
