Of course driving after taking mushrooms isn't the smartest idea... I hallucinated a stop sign in the middle of a 60 MPH highway, which proceeded to scare the living shit out of me; not because I knew it wasn't real, but actually the opposite. I rolled up, stopped, looked around for other cars, and my friend asked me what the fuck I was doing. I informed him there was a stop sign there, and he looked at me like I was insane, which I couldn't help but laugh at, and asked him what his problem was. His reply: 'Theres no stop sign dude, you're in the middle of the highway.' This totally blew my mind, I had to close my eyes for a minute, and when I opened them, sure enough, it was gone. I felt like I was driving about two miles per hour, everything was so distorted.
