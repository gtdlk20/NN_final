As I stared into the deep blue sky I began to see more, and I'll do my best to explain these images: They were faces that looked as if they were wearing shiny metal green masks and they were shooting down away from the 'alien ship' towards the truck towards us, but they just disappeared and more shot down towards me. Their teeth looked like they were somehow locked together and it looked as if the faces were straining to open their mouths, but they couldnt. They looked like something out of the movie Alien, it was scary but I was loving every minute of it.  When we finally get out of the bed of the truck we're at another friends house and I go into the room to change my shirt, but I cant tell whats clean or dirty cuz everything was moving around and all the colors I saw were melting into each other as if it were colored wax being burnt, and it was beautiful.  My mind perception was that I never wanted to go back to normal, I thought to myself I wanted to be like this forever, because not one time was I worried about anything. I thought to myself I wanted to be like this forever, because not one time was I worried about anything. I was on a complete different level from everyone else but at the same time, I had wished everyone else could feel as I did.
