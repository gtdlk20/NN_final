At some point paranoia set in, and I knew I should be getting home.  I couldn't remember for sure that I had eaten mushrooms, and wasn't convinced at this point that they were physically harmless.  I entertained the thought that I had gone insane or was dying and had to resist the urge to call someone at home to come and get me (I had my cell phone with me).  I felt that I was trapped in my mind, or in a fantasy world and that the only way to get out was either to find someone I knew and have them talk me out of it, or to kill myself.  This latter thought scared the bejesus out of me and I called up my rational mind to talk myself out of it.  It was almost as if I was watching the sober part of my mind try to convince the mushroomed part of my mind that there was no reason to think this way, but felt helpless to provide it with any kind of convincing argument.  I felt real fear that I might be unable to stop myself from committing suicide.  Every time I recognized my surroundings, I forced myself to walk toward home.
