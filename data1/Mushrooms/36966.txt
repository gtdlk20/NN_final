We all reunited in the bungalow.  I felt that I was still on the 'other side'.  This was an EXTREMELY profound feeling.  As I came down, I started feeling great gratitude for having another chance at life.  This is one of the major lessons that the mushrooms taught me.  They also taught me about the profound mystery of life and the interconnectedness of all of life and especially the importance of seizing the opportunity to love each other out of true openness and to try and live a truly altruistic life which is in the end really the key to our own happiness.  That is that giving truly is receiving and that hurting others in the end is only hurting ourselves.
