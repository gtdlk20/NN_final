For some reason I decided to take them at night as we were both free the next day so could stay up late, although now thinking about it, ingesting them in the day would have been best. We both ate down our sticky honey Pan Cyan contents, myself having roughly double (about 1 gram) what my gf had as it was her first time. We basically chomped down the contents at 12 Midnight. I went to prepare some lemongrass tea because I find it helps any kind of nausea or stomach cramping whilst taking mushrooms. My gf was in bed playing on her phone.
