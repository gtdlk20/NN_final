I closed my eyes and it hit me like a brick to the face, I was getting intense closed eye visuals, it was beutifully brilliant and colorful, patterns fly all around. To see this made me feel very overwhelmed. So I opened up my eyes to see that my surroundings had changed immensely. All of the trees seemes to breath in and out. The leaves and vines curled up into odd shapes. At this point I new I was tripping and there was no backing out now. Everything seemed to have a Dr. Seus apearence to it. I squeezed my jaw and I crushed it into ball, when I let go of it and it sprung back out to its natural form.
