T + 5:00 What shall we do with all these bizarre things all around us. We decided to do henna so we could remember our trip for a couple weeks. We were doing good on reading the directions until we forgot to leave it on for 2 to 3 hours instead of 30 minutes which is what we did. After taking off the henna we went to smoke and while sitting in the chair I felt as though I was leaving one world and entering the next. This was the time when I could see and feel all the different worlds connected to my oneness. I didn't feel as though I was apart of any particular world, I was in my center, looking out at everything else. I was in touch with myself and nothing could bother me if it tried.
