It was a warm October Friday night, a full moon was out, and I got a hold of about 3/8ths an ounce of Psilocybe Cubensis mushrooms.  Psilocybe Cubensis are the most commonly found mushrooms, due to the fact they have about moderate potency and are easily cultivated. With my 8:00 dinner I ate a bowl of salad with ground flax seed on top (rich in the Omegas which are good for the brain), took 2 all natural multi-vitamins, folic acid and b-complex. My blood type is O+ so I naturally need more of the folic and b12 as my body burns them quickly.
