I eventually found my way back inside, where Dave and Yon were relaxing and talking. I grinned at them. 'I've met god.' I said. 'It was me.' They seemed to find a fair bit of humor in this, and I sat down with them to talk. As we spoke, I munched a candy bar. It seemed to pixelate in my mouth, and the rhythm of my chewing seemed to be very motorized. I recalled this feeling, 'The Candy Feeling' as I've called it, from my first trip. After a while I went to the bathroom, and ended up staring at my reflection for a while. I realized that this was who I was, had always been, and always be. I decided then that there would be no guilt after this trip has ended. 'I've experienced too much, gained so much confidence, so much reassurance, there's no way I can feel guilty about this.'
