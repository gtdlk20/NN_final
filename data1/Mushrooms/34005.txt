We each chewed up our respective portions with water only and made our way across the parking lot (T+0:00). The line to buy tickets was HUGE and we stood there a good 15-20 minutes. I was feeling slightly light headed, but nothing to write home about. Ace, however, had started to sway back and forth and proceeded to start performing a very loud impression of Captain Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Carribbean. We finally got our tickets and headed up the escalator (T+0:25), where it took all three of us girls (my sister, her friend, and myself) to coax Ace up the moving stairs and make sure he didn't fall backwards. It was obviously hitting him HARD already.
