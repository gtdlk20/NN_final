This happened about a month before I turned 20.  I had gotten a hold of some shrooms from a rather inconsistent source, and I was looking forward to an evening of giggling, stumbling madness.  My friend, who will be referred to as k, had decided to experiment with some other drug, a research chemical not unlike 2cb.  About an hour after ingesting the shrooms, maybe less, I got a call from my mother (I should've known better than to answer).  I was supposed to see my father for the first time in over a decade that summer, and my mother was calling to tell me that the timing wasn't going to work out and I wouldn't be seeing him after all.  I was surprised by how hard I took this.  I don't remember exactly how I felt, but I was very unhappy and felt like this was a very, very big deal.  The trip went downhill from there.
