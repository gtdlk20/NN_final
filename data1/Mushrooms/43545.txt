It was easier to chew the bitter, dried mushrooms with everyone suffering the bad taste together as a group. I could hear Nate gagging a little after swallowing what I think was his first eighth of mushrooms, so I reminded him that thoroughly chewing them up, despite the bad taste, would give him a stronger onset of the high as well as less stomach cramps later on. We washed them down with water, and everyone was left with mush and stem pieces stuck in their teeth. Nate and Steve had claimed to have veteran status with the shrooms, but Pete and I confided to each other that they were probably lying in order to seem as cool and experienced as we were. Boy were they in for it as newbies!
