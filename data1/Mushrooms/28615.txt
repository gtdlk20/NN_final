The DMT played a slightly bigger role than I have time for, and I'm not sure why it seemed so incredibly significant to me, but I did find it interesting to feel compelled towards taking DMT while on shrooms. I did find it interesting to feel compelled towards taking DMT while on shrooms. As I had this foreign entity (I felt) controlling me and making me write this as his words went through my mind, I started to have him (or another almost voice) ask me what was more important, truth, or a happy illusion?  If this world wasn't real, the question seemed to form, would I rather stay with the illusion or would I rather know the truth.  I almost collapsed to the ground as I told myself over and over that no matter what it is, I need to know the truth.  I went out to the garage and was about to take a hit of DMT and blast myself off into the next universe.  I was crushed because I now believed that my entire family that I loved so much was just an illusion created by my own mind.  I didn't even know who or what I was.  I felt like I was something larger, more powerful, but that I had created this dream to 'retreat' to as I healed myself, or something like that.  Like maybe I was a little frail or something.  I had the pipe in hand and was crying for the first time in 20 years, and was just preparing for blast-off when I thought about my wife.  I thought about all the great times we've had together and how if this world was all in my head, that I don't know that I could have made a much better wife.  I decided that illusion or no, I wanted to at least go upstairs and say goodbye to her before I blasted off and she and this world disappeared into oblivion.
