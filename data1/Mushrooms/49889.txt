As I went to walk out of my room I noticed the threshold to the door was very difficult to pass. My mind was screaming to me how it was unsafe outside my room, and that it couldnt protect me once I crossed the threshold. I decided I'd go on my own and leave my mind behind to think aobut what to involve myself in next.
