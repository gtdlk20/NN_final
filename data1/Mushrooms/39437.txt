Just last night I went to a Dave Matthews concert. I have never tripped on LSD, just mushrooms, several times. Once again I'd eat the shrooms before my concert. I took a little less than usual but they were getting old and I think might have made a little more potent. I didn't realize the trip I was in for. The night before, my sister whom I was going to the concert with told me not to embarrass her because I was going with her friends who are a few years older. By the way, I just graduated high school. Anyways, none of the people I went with did any drugs at all. They were actually against it. So I knew I'd have to be somewhat 'normal'. When we got to the lot before the concert. I ate my shrooms, drank a few beers and smoked some bowls. About 45 minutes in the lot the visuals kicked in first. There were lines in the sky everywhere, travelling every which way. The whole atmosphere was just swaying and whoa, just looked real cool. I said at the time 'I hope I just stay like this all night I'll be great.'
