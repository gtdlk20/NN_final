Dorian tried talking to me again and surprisingly I was able to say what. And that was all. I couldn't talk again. This went on for the rest of the night untill I fell asleep and awoke the next morning. I talked to Dorian about what happend. I told him what happened when I was in his room alone and he told me 'Dude, I was outside for like 10 minutes, my parents werent yelling about me they were watching tv with the kids.' I was shocked. He also told me about stuff I did that I dont even remember. I Apparently grabbed his ear and tried to rip it off and openend a bottle of fake whine, drank some and dumped it on the floor and just did stupid shit. I asked him why he didnt trip at all and he said he was but he needed to keep his cool cause I was tweaking. He also told me that he called matt (thats right he was talking to my dealer on my phone last night. I wonder why I couldent remember who matt was) and he was the one that calmed him down and told him everything was cool. All in all, this experience was half bad and half good. I was scared some of the time but I just adapted to my thoughts.
