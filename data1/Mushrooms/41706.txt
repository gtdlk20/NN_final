After that, the trip gets blurry, but I do know that Alice In Wonderland ended and the screen made that blurry, annoying visual so I took the movie out but left the Tv on the same channel, which is normally just random news and things. However, that evening (It was about 5 o clock) there was a stage performance of some woman with a harp, and things in the background I couldn't understand. But the woman just stood out to me and symbolized something I couldn't put my finger on - but the main thing that amazed me about it was that had played the harp when I was 5 and 6, so it seemed like an intense sign that this was on while I was under the influence of an enlightening drug like this. I was completely mesmerized by the program, but instead of watching the ugly Tv screen with all the blurriness I couldn't comprehend, I danced around my room, probably for a good half hour or so, but I'm really not sure. I always ended up coming back to one of my mirrors - there are two large ones in my room, and I would just stare at myself and touch my face. Later, this turned out to be a bit frightening as I attempted to peel my skin off. But at the time, I was having an absolute blast.. I rolled around on my floor and danced and sung and did yoga... it was just incredible how much better everything seemed. I remember at some point I was laying on my floor and looked over at the white wall, and there was a (non-existent) smudge that was moving up and down it, so I stared at it for 30 seconds then took a picture of it, which I looked at the next day and it was simply a blurry picture of my blank wall.
