About 2 weeks ago I decided to venture into the world of magical mushrooms.  I only started experimenting with drugs this year, and mushrooms would be my first hallucinogenic drug experience.  A friend and I ate them with apple juice as a chaser at about 8:45 AM. They tasted pretty gross but it was manageable. We were staying at a resort, so we decided to go and sit in this lounge area and wait for them to kick in.  About 20 minutes later we became giggly and were acting kinda weird. I'm not sure if it was in anticipation or what. My friend, who weighs only 100 pounds, starting feeling it about then and said my face was melting off.  I was surprised because I was expecting it to take a lot longer to kick in.  We went into this bathroom and I started feeling a body high and the walls were closing in on us. We ran out, sat outside and smoked a cigarette.  Plants were starting to look very weird and we got this weird urge to run and find a hidden meadow. So we did.
