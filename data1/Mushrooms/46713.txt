Walking to the next ride I am feeling disorientated, I donÂ’t really know exactly where I am going, good thing C and P where there to guide us, although M does not feel like he is really coming up and has accepted that he may just have to settle for a light buzz and just try and enjoy the rides. We had to take a skyline over to the next section of rides and we just laughed and talked trippy bollocks. There were quite a few people in with us who seemed confused as to our state of being; M is acting it up because he enjoys the paranoia. I however feel apprehensive about the situation; sober people have never been my strong point when tripping the light fantastic.
