She sounded very flirting and happy, and her voice was echoing in my head. I began to, not see, but feel a female presence - female faces laughing in my direction. Not laughing at me, but rather laughing with me - I started to giggle. In this song, there's hands clapping in the middle of it, and when they started to clap, I was clapping myself, and I saw two hands clapping in front of me, and it was sort of weird, but yet it felt warm and loving.
