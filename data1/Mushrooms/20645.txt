At some point, I started crying from the beauty and meaningfulness of it all, though I realized I still didn't have what I was looking for. Tears of ecstasy quickly became tears of sadness again, and as I began to sob quietly things reached peak levels of weird. My arms were no longer my own, and my tongue moved without any input from me. The voice that came out was still mine, but it was not me doing the talking. The entity/alien/mushroom had begun to comfort me. It took my arms, extended my pointer finger, and began poking me in the face and chest while it tried to really, really drive home the point that you are the universe.
