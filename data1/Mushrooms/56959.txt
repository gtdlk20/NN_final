So we get to our spot and I eat this little thing and after maybe 20 min like usual I start getting very clear headed and trees look so nice. I also start getting the happy grin on my face and get waves of tingling in my arms and legs and as time goes on I also start feeling nauseous which I'm trying to ignore so I started looking out in the break of trees at the sky because the sun is almost completely down and I start seeing a purple orange blend of sky so I call M over who's starting to come up on his acid and we spend maybe 10 min starting at the sky mind blown about how nice it looks but than I started to get sick and dry heave so everyone lets me be for a few.
