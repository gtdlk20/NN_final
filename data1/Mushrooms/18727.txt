Anxiety - in terms of anxious about events in life, maybe a bit lower. Yet I do feel my body still physically anxious. For example, when someone cuts me off driving I still get pissed off, yet am then able to reign myself in more quickly. I sometimes feel like I am sort of crawling out of my own skin a bit. But maybe this is just my body getting used to the lower dose of Lexapro, and my self feeling more emotions in general.
