Its really hard to explain the next parts because it seemed like everything happened all at once, not in a linear way. It wasnt like time stopped, it was like time didnt even exist. Its hard to even recall this part in my memory because I was so far gone. I cant really recall details, more the like broad strokes of what happened. At this point its more like a memory of a memory.
