Erowid Note: There is a slight discrepency in the reported dose of 8 grams, and the arithmetic-derived dose. Author reports acquiring 1/2 oz (14.17 grams), eating 1/8 oz (3.54 grams) one weekend, then first 5 grams for the experience reported here, followed by the remainder of the 1/2 oz., which would be ~5.6 grams, for an approximate total of 10.6g (rather than 8g).
