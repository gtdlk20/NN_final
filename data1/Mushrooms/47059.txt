A guy was sitting next to me playing the drum really good. He had some cool braids in his hair and was wearing overalls and tye-dye. I loaded a small chunk of a cap in my pipe and passed it to him. He frowned and I used hand gestures pointing at my bag of shrooms that it was a cap, he nodded his head toked it up and I told him to pass it along. I loaded about a gram of stem after that and proceeded to eat the rest of my half ounce! Now, even though the whole night was just amazing, I really wished I would have stuck with no more than a 1/4 because my brain got a little too scrambled later on.
