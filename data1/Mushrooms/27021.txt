Just then I hear an explosion closely followed by another and another. It sounded like someone was lighting off dynamite in my back yard. I turned around and looked out of my window which was upstairs and I could see flashing lights like rapid fire lighting bolts, or mortar fire from some old Vietnam War flick. So then, as you might imagine, I got kind of scared. I could also tell that the mushrooms effects were increasing by the minute. My auditory perception was increasing. It felt like things were 10 times louder than normal. It was like someone was in my ears turning up the volume. The explosions sounded like they were getting closer and louder. I ran downstairs, and as I stood up I felt fungals doing their magic all over my body but that was the last thing I wanted to think about at that moment. The threat around me was more imminent. I ran to the front door to make sure it was locked, and I had a very clear thought and image in my mind of men in military fatigues going door to door killing the families on my street and I had the feeling that I was next. For some reason I thought to myself Its the 3rd Reich!  Yeah for some reason rouge gorilla military outfits in the middle of my neighborhood didnt seem so far fetched. I think it had something to do with all the mushrooms I took.
