The object of my affections at the time (let's call him Jeff) asked me to go swimming with him.  We made the journey along the sun-baked rocks, past the guard and weaved our way through the tents to the deep green river.  I was scantilly clad and removed my sandals and walked in.  The deliciously cool water enveloped my skin.  It was the most wonderful experience I had ever had, and after a brief dip, he and I wandered back to his tent, retracing our steps to the guard post.  There was a new person there who refused to let me in.  All of my belongings and senses of comfort were within that campground.  Rather than arguing with the woman, I let Jeff speak for me and I stared at the dust on the ground, dumb-struck that this person, in the face of such mind-bobbling beauty, could care about something like a wristband.
