I feel my understanding of common knowledge leaving me.  Concepts of 'self', 'cities', 'love', and 'life' lose meaning, and when that happens, confusion begins to mix with the fear.  My soul is torn asunder, my spirit laid bare.  The intensity is mind boggling.  Imagine falling from a cliff, and imagine the feeling you might have 1 second before hitting the bottom.  That is the feeling I had for about 3 hours, coupled with vision ripping hallucinations and mental hysteria.
