We laughed when we thought about ourselves sitting on a blanket drawing, listening to the beatles as a crime, we wanted to know who it was hurting.  We werent even hurting ourselves.  And while tripping we dont want to interact with others, so were definitely not interfering with anyone else. Its sad how close minded of a world weve come to live in.  But we wont let it get the best of us.  We still have our little escapes from reality.
