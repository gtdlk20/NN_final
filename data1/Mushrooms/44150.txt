I set up an altar and blanket on my backyard lawn to serve as a point of departure and resting space for the experience. After the initial ceremony, I ingested the tea I made from 3 grams of powdered cubensis (about 11:00 AM). I sat upright and assumed a meditative awareness. Within 20 minutes or so, I already began to feel the effects  an increased heart rate, a tingling throughout my limbs, and a shifting external perception. After I relieved myself in the nearby ferns, I felt like lying down, and did so. Its hard to remember exactly what I was feeling in the next moments other than a vague sense of ego-dissolution; my awareness certainly felt less connected to my physical body. I cant say it was a pleasant sensation, but I was intent on letting go nonetheless.
