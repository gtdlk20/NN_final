Then I remember beginning to coalesce back into two selves, my real world self and my trip world self. I had a conversation with my trip self. He said to me its nice to be back isnt it? I was overcome with a joyful clarity, like the clarity of the air after a hurricane. None of my real world baggage had returned and I had this sensation of absolute clarity, as if I could see something as clearly at 10ft as I could at 10 miles.  I replied that I do not remember being here before. Trip Doug replied that I had been there before, 20 years ago when I had tripped at a house on Fire Island. I then remembered that trip, recalled just getting over that edge that separated reality from this world for the first time that 23 years ago. I remembered much of that trip, details that had been long forgotten.  He said you never got far enough into this world to see me but I could see you. You knew there was more there didnt you? I was the one who put the idea in your head to trip again. You didnt even remember the details of your last trip, you just knew for some reason you wanted to come back here. I was the one that made you come back.
