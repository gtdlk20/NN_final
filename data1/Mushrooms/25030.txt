Physically I was still on the couch and could not see into the rooms which I had entered, but I could watch from where I sat through the eyes of my spirit side.  Door closed I could see into my roomates bedroom. Watching and appreciating Buck, my roomates beautiful Blue Tick dog.  The other half of my spirit self that had split entered the kitchen, which again I could not physically see into without getting up from the couch, and stared at the empty pasta plate on the table w/ admiration. Seconds later I watched the Two rejoin and disperse.
