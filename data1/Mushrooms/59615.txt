We were all getting quite silly in the car, laughing a little but all trying to let the mushrooms take control of us and not just trying to play up on the fact that we were poisoned, all slightly worrying if we had taken enough and if we were going to be that out of it. Our paranoia soon came to end as soon as a foot was stepped out of the car. A slight breeze against our intoxicated cheeks, floating towards his front door as if we had just been dropped off on some weightless paradise. Colours so intense, even though it had been dark outside for a few hours. Walls of nearby houses were morphing between different shades of pink and purple, all of us in complete and utter harmony with each other and our surroundings.
