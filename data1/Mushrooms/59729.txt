Oct. 11  It was three cakes birthday today.  One of the cakes from yesterday, which was not fully colonized, now is.  They both have fuzzy white mycelium growing on the surface, in some places up to a half inch think.  I started the light on a timer today, two hours of indirect natural light from 6AM to 8AM everyday.  Then another hour of light in the evening, around 10 or 11.  The temp stays between 75 and 77, up to 81 when the light is on.  Im planning on birthing the majority of the remaining cakes tomorrow, three or four.  One of the cakes, I think Ill just throw it out, its only half colonized, I could start a new jar and finish before this one will.  I was surprised this one grew at all anyway, the substrate was fucked from the beginning.  Ill just extract whatever psilocybin may be in it and try to trip balls.
