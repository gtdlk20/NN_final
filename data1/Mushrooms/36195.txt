I lay there for another hour. For some reason I felt the need to keep slapping the wall, and that continued for a good while. My uncontrollable yawning would not relent, so I just decided to flow with it and ended up creating some highly original and quite musical exotic sounding yawns. I got up and surveyed my room. The door was open and had probably been so for a long time so I closed it. My music was sounding so awesome that I had this crazy idea that I would collect up all 4 of my speakers and lie on my bed covered in my speakers to see if that improved the music.
