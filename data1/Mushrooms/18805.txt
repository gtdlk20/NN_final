9:58 (T+1:13) : I realised something else. In my life I always worry about a lot of stuff, but most of the time I worry because I don't do like the rest of my friends. I don't like to go in bars to pick up girls, because I don't like this and for me this is not the way to start a relationship. I don't like to party every saturday because sometimes I just feel like relaxing and getting some rest. What ? I was worrying about this ? I do have the right to be myself and to have my own principles and way to live. We're all different. Do your stuff. I decided I would listen to myself more from now instead of listening to people.
