D talked about how hot he was, and when he said that, I would feel a wave of heat go through my body into my head immediately.  He went into the kitchen and I was very aware of a crinkling sound (he later told me he was putting a bag of frozen peas on his head).  I heard him turn on the kitchen faucet, and it sounded good so I proceeded there.  I didnÂ’t make it to the kitchen, before he had turned off the water and started back to the room I was in.  When he saw me, he let out a laugh.  I was overwhelmed again and went back to the floor.
