T= 1:30 - During the next hour or so, we walked all over this park, which was covered in snow. JP and I were having crazy conversations about life, and I noticed that I was certainly feeling different than if I had smoked some marijuana. Instead of leveling off after a half hour, I instead would just keep getting further and further into the trip.
