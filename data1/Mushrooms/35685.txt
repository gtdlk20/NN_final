Finally I decided to just stop. I stopped and kept very still and looked around at the dead quiet forest. I noticed that the trees had a whole layer of color to them that I didnt usually see. Almost like a glowing ultraviolet blues and reds. Almost like they were a part of the screen. I found that this perception was increased the longer I was able to maintain a perfectly still body and mind. I've always tried to see the aura and at this point I beleive that I was seeing the aura of the trees. They were swaying towards me like huge brocolis. I was vividly aware that they were real living entitities who have consciousness but one that is different from ours. Slower. And the more I slowed my bodily system down the more I could tune in to them.
