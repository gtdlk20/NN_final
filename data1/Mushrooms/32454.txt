At 5pm the same day we thought we would give it another go. We did a slightly larger quantity. It went down pretty easy, we strolled off down the beach. It was very different this time. No drunkenness at all. No nausea at all. I thought that it wasnt going to work. The first thing that I noticed was, quite clearly, there was a face in the sky. It was a stylized image constructed of Aztec type geometrical shapes with a hint of Maori tribal tattoo design influence. We had been commenting to each other. Do you feel anything yet and the answer had always been no. So I said do you see that face in the sky? No she didnt. Apparently there was only a roundish hole in the clouds. After this I began noticing amazing, beautiful patterns in the sand and in the wash of water as the waves receded. This beach has minerals in the sand that rise up with the water wash and make spectacular patterns, we could touch them and wipe them off and watch them rise up again. But the drug added an extra dimension to this experience and enhanced our fascination for and appreciation of this wonderful world we live in.
