My overall mood for the high was childish, which I attribute to the state of mind I cultivated before dosing. I began to reconnect with my childhood before dosing, by reading Sideways Stories From Wayside High, and the shrooms seemed to make this connection more powerful. It felt good to revisit a simpler time, when I could eat cookies and make a mess, watch tv and giggle without a care. It felt good to be a kid again.
