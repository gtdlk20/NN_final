I looked up at the stars, the feeling I got from them was very similar to looking at the stars on weed, a big 'whoa.' Nothing new/special really. The trees, on the other hand, were growing to 600 feet tall and then would shrink to a few inches, very slowly and fluid-like. The fog was beginning to roll in, the lights from the town shown onto the fog and created a sort of swirling/flushing effect. The light would turn liquid like and blend with the fog and then just swirl, very plesant to look at. I went back to pacing and thinking about life in general and my life and how I lived it. I could look at things so much easier. I had floated above my corporeal self and was looking down with superiority over the mere mortal who stood before me.  He could not think of things that I could! Of course, it was me down there, but you understand (I hope).
