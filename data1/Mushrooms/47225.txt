45 minutes after first taking them I rolled over onto my stomach and momentarily closed my eyes. I was rather surprised to notice a series of flashing lights disappearing towards a point slightly to the left of the center of my vision. I kept my eyes closed wanting to see more of this. The more I concentrated the vision changed, becoming a pattern similar to that of a leafs underside. The area between each of the veins upon closer inspection seemed to each be a portal to a different vision. I focused first on one with a man standing in the desert, then another of swirling lights.
