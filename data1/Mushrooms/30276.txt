Since September of my senior year in high school, I have been experimenting with drugs both in hopes of gaining insight into my problems, interest and self-medication. It has been roughly two years since then and my list of drug exploits includes weed, shrooms, LSD, MDMA in rock form and in cut rolls, 2c-e, 25-I nbome, cocaine, a few pills (which I try to stay away from), alcohol, and a few other unimportant things not worth mentioning. Out of everything, I prefer psychedelics.
