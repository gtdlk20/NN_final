What I like to call thought derailment occurred as random memories bubbled up in my mind, and other ideas seemed to just pop out of nowhere and proceed to float away like it never happened. The scenery was stunning; mossy oaks, pine tree clusters, rampant undergrowth. I felt like I appreciated nature like never before. After we peaked, I felt like I was truly alive! 'Organic' is the best word I can think of to describe it. 'Organic' is the best word I can think of to describe it. I could almost feel how much water my body was made of, and the boundary between my skin and the humidity in the air had dissolved, like I was melding into nature.
