Except that he didnt somehow like my presence.  Because I think at that moment I angered him greatly by me laughing at this great spectacle.  He constricted my body and I felt my vitals give out.  My breathing slowly stopped and I felt my heart slow to a stop.  It was then that I fell back on to my bed, and died.  I died and disintegrated into pieces, and had realized that I had somewhere along the line grown 6 extra arms, because I could use them to feel my broken body.  My hearing became really high pitched, like the hearing after a rock concert, it was constantly ringing.  I could hear my parents say what is wrong with you son, and I heard them say that they were going to be there for me when I died.  I was hoping that in real life they hadnt appeared in my room because I was incapacitated and couldnt respond.  The entire time I knew the shrooms were lying to me.
