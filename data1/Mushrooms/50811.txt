We both commented at the exact same time that 'we should smoke pot now' and we did. The shrooms were quite powerful, and the pot kicked them into full gear. Within 10 minutes of smoking the 3rd bowl (we did 3 in a row each), I was tripping 'harder' than I had ever imagined possible (heard THAT before, huh?). One second i was wondering if i was invincible, and the next second i got NAILED by a surge of energy and flopped off the couch, onto the ground. I didn't even notice; I wasn't really paying attention to my body. My mind was in a different place. I was thinking about life in general (if it can be called thinking) and the connections we make with every person we meet. I felt little bits of everybody I'd met showing in me; the way I speak, the way I look, the way I act; it's all been done before; nobody's original, we're all just animals struggling to live. These thoughts were not nearly as organized and to-the-point as my previous mushroom trips (where the whole trip, my thoughts would be going on ONE general direction, and everything would finally tie itself together near the end; destination reached); Maybe they were, but I was definitely not in good enough shape to make the connections that were trying to be made.
