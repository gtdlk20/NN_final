I was eventually able to get control of my limbs to get up and head to the bathroom. I had drunk so much water that I couldn't stay sitting in that chair any longer.  I wobbled to the bathroom slowly since now the mushrooms were in full effect.  I suddenly stopped as I entered the bathroom.  I looked squarely at the mirror, and my reflection in front of me, only to notice that my mind seemed somehow outside my body, as if 'I' were in-between my physical body and my reflection.  My thoughts quickly turned to feelings of how this was possible.  My mind had no body, which I envisioned how death must certainly be.  What if when we die our mind truly does wander the earth for a while, before it's time for its ascent to judgement. At those thoughts,  the mirror started to wave in a liquid motion, and my reflection was being stretched and distorted in several vertical waves.  I walked over quickly and sat down on the seat because I wasn't able to concentrate on standing still, or even standing up, for any length of time after tuning out the mirror incident.
