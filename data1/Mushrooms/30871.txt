Over the following years I went to university majoring in chemistry, and later, electronics engineering technology. During the cold war I worked for 16 years, in Seattle, in electronics with an emphasis on avionics and hydroacoustics (sonar) design. I also raised a wonderful family. No point in saying, I am not a stoner.
