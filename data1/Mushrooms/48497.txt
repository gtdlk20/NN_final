Things became rather blurry, and I began to see tracers, following things as they moved. The street lights took on a glowing and magical appearance, while I contemplated my life. I donÂ’t remember getting home, but I do remember sending my brother upstairs and listening to music for about 2 hours, enchanted. I really felt like I could touch the music. John Coltrane never sounded so good.
