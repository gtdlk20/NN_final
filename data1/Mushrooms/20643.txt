As these patterns continued to rotate, everything began to pulse slightly. This pulsing felt very comfortable and joyful. With the pulsing came recognizable images from our own world, and it was at this point that I managed to completely let go and lose myself. I can remember that I was drooling uncontrollably as I began chewing on the corner of my blanket. I wouldn't say I remember more than 5% of what I was shown, but I do remember lots and lots of pine trees, carved reliefs of sunflowers, many different types of birds and other small woodland  creatures, rotating 3D crystals made of perfect geometry, and then finally 9 men on bicycles riding over mountains formed in the strands of the web. It feels worth noting for some reason that these men bared a striking resemblance to the design of the famous Bicycle Day artwork, though they weren't exact replicas.
