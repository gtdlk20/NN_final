The visuals took over at this point.  As we headed down, I would look back up toward the girls and not see them, only the blurry, nebulous mountains they were supposed to be hiking.  The mountains seemed very flat and small, and they all looked the same.  I looked toward the sky and my vision became kaleidoscopic, I saw blue prisms twisting and turning at impossible and inhuman angles, so I looked away.  I looked at my friend J, a 6'5' black man, and noticed a third eye in the middle of his forehead.  This made me nervous, and I decided we should sit down, although what I said was 'You're making me feel short, lets sit down for a minute.'
