I had a little struggle however at the peak. My stomach was acting up, bringing me to a state of discomfort and leading me to my first amazing realization: The power of my conscience mind. I was able, by concentrating profusely and without interruption, to dissolve the pain and discomfort in my stomach. It felt almost as though I had thrown the pain to a whirlpool in the middle of my abdomen and it had been swallowed up. At this time of discomfort my thoughts began to find holes of which I had to climb out of, just as I had healed my stomach I had to heal my mind of painful past occurences, realizing my inability to change the past. After completing these tasks I was able to respond to my friend and to begin thinking and observing. There were general themes at this point of a few exchanged words, exclamations of amazement and then moments of silence that lasted up to what seemed an hour, swallowed in our thoughts.
