I thought, 'I had better go tomorrow and buy me a gas mask,' and then I had a terrifying vision.  Some type of chemical attack happened, I had my gas mask on and then looked at my family.  They looked as if someone splashed highly corrosive acid all over their faces.  They stood together like in a family portrait, all facing me.  My mom, dad and brother, all looked at me as they slowly died.  I pulled off my mask, I was not going to let my family die before my eyes, I would die with them.  Too late, because of my greed and selfishness in only buying me a gas mask, I had to watch my family die before my eyes, I could not die with them because I had the mask on.  I had to see them die before I died myself.
