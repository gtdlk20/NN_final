It was a while before I left the state of believing this is how it has always been, this is how it always will be, essentially with a constantly changing perception of reality, none of which being the actual one.  Walking home was a trick, as my body had turned to jello.  I was safe in my room when I came down, feeling like my soul had stretched to great lengths out into the universe, and finally came all back into me like a closing flower blossom, leaving me content and happy with sanity.
