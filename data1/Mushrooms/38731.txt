I layed back and enjoyed my warm, friendly chair.  It was soft and squishy and comforting.  I touched my toe to the end table near the bed.  The smooth wood was also glowing with warmth.  It was amazing.  I was enjoying myself so much that I still couldnt stop smiling and giggling.  I felt almost like a lunatic because my friends werent feeling so ecstatic but I didnt care.  The shapes and patterns and colors and sounds and lights and temperatures swam around me.  I couldnt differentiate between my different senses, but everything made me feel so wonderfully happy that I didnt care.
