Our environment was to be the housing cooperative where they live and I work. We're all a great group of friends there, and an accepting drug culture, limited to 'Hippy' drugs: marijuana, salvia, acid, mushrooms and the such, so it was a friendly place. Lots of murals, lots of places to explore, and a short walk from a forest and a garden.
