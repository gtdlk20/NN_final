A few months ago I was offered some shrooms by a dealer friend, and although it is common sense that a person of my fragile mind should never touch psycedelics, it thought fuck it and purchased just over three grams of what I was informed were liberty cap magic mushrooms. I know some people will wonder why I would risk my sanity for the sake of a mushroom trip, but the honest answer is I dont really care! For me, suffering a mental illness wasnt all bad, apart from a profound paranoia, I was just a happy go lucky soul oblivious to all world around me, and to this day i remain a happy person. My philosophy is simple  Im going to die one day so I might as well have as much fun as possible in before I croak.
