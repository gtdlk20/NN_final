About one week before the experience I went to pick some shrooms with my brother, he wanted to have an experience and I know where to get it. So I picked about 75 grams of shrooms, and prepared 50 grams of fresh shroom in a brew. He drank about 2/5 of the total amount (there was about 30 grams brew left), had a mild experience. As for me I didn't have much time to appropriately trip, so I stored it for another few days until I was sure I had the time, the right set and setting.
