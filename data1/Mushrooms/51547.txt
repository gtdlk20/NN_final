So back to today and my curiosity -  I ran upstairs and grabbed a cap it was .8gz, threw it in the coffee grinder and capped off a bongload pretty genorously... I must say after 2 rips i didnt feel the need to puff down nemore for about 25 minutes... Its definately a nice mood right now .. i see some visual effects after 2-3 more hits but nothing too intense... definayely feeling it tho prolly only .3gz to my head right now im sure if i smoked as much as id usually ingest i would be ballzin but i aint feelin that tonite, and so ends my report.
