Time was nothing.  Five minutes felt like five days.  So many things are running through my head that I felt more alive than ever before.  Colors seemed so vibrant that the surface of objects seemed to ripple and shimmer.  When I would walk into a different colored room my mood would change instantly and I would begin thinking about something else.  I spent a half hour in the bathroom staring at the floor because the pattern was continuously moving and I felt as if I was swaying.  I had silk boxers on and it felt like they were made of water so I took them off and finished the night commando.
