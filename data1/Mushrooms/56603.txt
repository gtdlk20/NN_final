My friend thought I was acting a little crazy so I decided it was best to relax and listen to music. I plugged in my headphones and couldnt even focus enough to plug in my iPod. I just laid there and felt so ridiculous. I didnt need music because I could start to hear this horrible, haunting sound. I cant really explain it, except that it scared me. This was the first time Id felt scared on psychedelics. I started to feel disconnected with my body, as if all I were was a floating brain, beginning to rise out of my body, very gradually.
