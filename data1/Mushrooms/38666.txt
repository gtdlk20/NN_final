By the way- Mushrooms were not meant for people that 'want to get fucked' or just want to trip.  Shrooms are a very powerful natural substance that can open door that I never dreamed possible.  When you trip, dont just do it to do it, do it to find a deeper meaning to life, to find out new theories, perspectives, and ideas nobody could ever come up with without the help of the fungus.  It is a sacred being that should be treated with respect, and although not mentioned in this report, the things your mind can produce can and will blow you away, so prepare before every trip, so you can make more room to soak up some of the infinite things your mind comes up with. and make sure it is the right time/place/and is going to be beneficial-hell, shrooms are always beneficial (to me).
