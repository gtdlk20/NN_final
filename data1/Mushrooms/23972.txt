Considering that it was so long ago since I had taken shrooms I wasnt at all sure what to expect, however, I was still surprised when noticing a definite change in perception after only 15 minutes  from what I could remember, mushrooms used to take upwards of 45 minutes to hit me. Stumbling into the kitchen to make myself a soothing cup of tea (promptly forgotten about the second the water had boiled), I noticed that all the surfaces in my little flat were bulging and shifting ever so slightly. I was fascinated when a heavy, squeezy sensation overtook my body, especially my arms: I always enjoy the initial 'Ah, so this is what its like!' effect drugs have, even if it often makes me feel a little anxious.
