My hands seemed different to me, like they were someone elseÂ’s hands on my body.  I looked myself in the eyes again and so many questions about the future sprung to mind.  After over 20 minutes in the mirror I felt as if I was unfinished when I left.  I looked outside and faraway lights looked as if they were dancing.  They would move around and then explode and melt back into another light, the only thing I could relate it to would be a firework show.  The sounds of nature and traffic were soothing and I felt like I was in synch with all of my surroundings.
