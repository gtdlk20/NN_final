YOURE GAY!  This idea suddenly burst into my mind as if someone had put a megaphone into my brain and shouted the words.  What the fuck? was pretty much all I thought in response.  I suddenly began to relive the lives of others as I had before earlier in the trip, but this time I relived very, very rough lives.  Pain, suffering, and hatred directed towards me were all my soul felt during this experience.  I didnt think I was actually gay, but for some reason I just accepted this idea, like I was told a million times and finally just submitted to it. A couple of the lives that my soul quickly flew though were of gay people that were scorned by society.  The others were similarly ostracized; another example being when I felt like several shameless homeless people at certain points, the kind that sleep in public and cause passersbys to shake their heads in disgust.  I dont recall most of the little conversation I made with my roommate during this period, but at one point he said, fittingly, some people just dont understand the lives we live man.  We just do a lot of wild and stupid shit.  He was playing a music video on his laptop by some methed out redneck rapper named Riff Raff at the time, and I began to hear myself in his lyrics.  I dont recall exactly what stuck out to me, but the idea was that my life wasnt pretty, that it was for all to see, and that is what not to be envied.  I believed suddenly: I am Riff Raff.  The meaning for this thought was twofold, as I literally thought that my whole life was a hallucination and that I was, in reality, the man I was currently watching on my roommates computer screen.  I also thought about the definition of the words, riff raff meaning the masses or the common people.  This definition perfectly fit the identity crisis-like scenario I was going through at the moment.
