I've also compiled many psychoactive experiences in my life. When I took the voyage I am about to describe I had already taken mushrooms over twenty times, LSD two or three times, LSA, DXM about twenty times and cannabis over one thousand times. Apart from those hallucinogens, I'd taken ecstasy several times, methylphenidate far too much, a handful of cocaine binges, and some opiates, and I was beginning to get slightly addicted to alcohol.
