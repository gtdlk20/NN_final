Around this time four more guys came over, and I commented on how there where now quite a few people in the house (13).  But I figured that there was no use worrying about it and felt confident that everything would go fine.  Now about 30, 40 minutes in, I was starting to feel the beginnings.  Listening to Riders On The Storm, I just smiled and became enfatuated with the fiber optic light, coined 'The Universe' and rightly so.  Although it was a white light, I was amazed at how green it seemed.  Next thing I remember the four guys had left and all of us were huddled over by the fire, an intricate mesh of blankets and bodies.  By now I had lost most of my concept of time and understood only when I looked at the clock.  I was completely stretched out on the floor, my head on Renee.  I was looking around the room, and starting to feel just a little bit scared, everything in the room was moving pretty intensely and I could hardly comprehend the numerous colors pulsing around, then changing into other colors.
