The trip just kept getting stronger and stronger from there.  I found myself exploring everything.  It was all so neat, and at any moment I couldnt decide to further explore what I was working on, or try something new.  I began having very profound thoughts.  My perspective on the world began to break down.  I couldnt think of a fish as just a fish anymore.  Now it was a part of an entire ecological system, and it was made of millions of molecules, and had all kinds of tissues and a distinct evolutionary history.  It got in the tank somehow and must have had a life before that.  The boundaries between everything were breaking down.  All of my previously held beliefs were subject to radical questioning - even the laws of physics.  I leaned against a huge stone bench, and honestly believed that it was possible that it might skid out and slide across the ground, in direct defiance of what I had previously known as friction.
