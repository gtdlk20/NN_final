There it was my soul was sitting besides me, it kept warm (later I learnt that it was the fire that was keeping me warm). My soul had a deep conversation with me, it spoke of those people that I cared for, beginning with my family and then my friend and last the people that were sitting beside (I was now getting short miniscule in time weak up reality calls), it then spoke about me to me... My soul was speaking about me to me!!!!! The last thing I can remember that we derived from the conversation, was the meaning of life... this pleased me a lot, I had found the meaning of life, then I came to realize that that was not important, the meaning was not important it was life itself, how it was lived...
