This is my first trip report as well as my first trip on magic mushrooms. Leading up to this trip I tried to do everything right as my last attempt with 1.8 grams did not result in the experience that I had hoped for. That time I had failed to provide the best set and setting, rushed into it, had eaten shortly beforehand and only started with 0.5 grams due to being nervous. I ended up eating 1.8 grams total but nothing was right and I ended up laying in bed frustrated and trying too desperately to see something, anything really, and I quickly regretted wasting those mushrooms. Being a new business owner, I have been hyper focused on expanding my mind and being on my best A game. I really wanted a trip that would help me to see my path better and to kind of clean out the old cob webs that had been weighing me down lately.
