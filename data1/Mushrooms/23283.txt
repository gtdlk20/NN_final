I have done a quick run of the house. Anything that would bother me normally is gone; some doors are kept wide open, some closed to avoid any issues. ItÂ’s 4:00pm and that loud phone in the computer room is unhooked. Some relaxing music is at the ready should I get spooked and need to change the atmosphere. All regular precautions with exception of a sitter have been taken. I have taken three light doses - two without much effect - one month prior today to get an idea of how the drug affects me. So far all I know is it makes whatever I imagine, much easier to believe.
