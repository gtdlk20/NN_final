For 3 hours I was stupefied. Generally it was a heavy experience, not uplifting at all, but a weird witchcraft type feeling was there. I sensed it as a sinister situation that I just had to ride out. Also it magnified morbidity and stomach problems. The chemical effect of the trip made it manifestly clear to me that chemistry is a foundation of consciousness. Any change to it affects my experience of life. I recognise my need to keep in mind other peoples shifting, changing body chemistry, and how it may affect their emotions and perceptions.
