I started thinking.  I thought real hard about the nature of the world and the way things were.  My last trip's theme for my brain seemed to be the wonder of my existance, this one was about being one with peace and nature.  The visuals to my surprise heightened, and the O.E.V.s of C.E.V.s now had more color and more of a fluid flow to them.  They'd only appear directly in front of what my eyes were concentrating on, and not just randomly everywhere, so I could just watch them transform.
