Then we were interrupted by calls from the house, and found that Phil had totally lost touch with his sense of reality. Later he described the understandable feeling of overload, (we estimated he had had 8 grams) and unending confusion. He was upstairs saying and doing utterly embarrassing things, and had eventually retreated under Walt's bed. He had also broken a CD case and cut himself, and from the sound of things I wanted no part in his trip. Despite my label as 'the responsible one', I feared Phil was still pissed off at me, and I didn't think he wanted to be helped. I was having a great time and only wanted it to continue. Phil also seemed to have infected Pete and Bryan with some sort of primal energy, and the three of them had, as Hunter S. Thompson would have described them, 'degenerated to the level of dumb beasts'. They were running around upstairs talking like horny cavemen. Phil especially seemed to be looking for a wet hole to screw, but eventually me and Walt reassured ourselves that he was no danger to himself or the property, and we went back outside.
