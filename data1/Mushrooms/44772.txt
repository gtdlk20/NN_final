After experimenting for a while with different quantities and methods of ingestion, I came across Terence McKennas preferred dosing/technique.  Unfortunately, I only had 3.3g left from my last crop and not the 5+ McKenna seems to prefer.  Other than the dosage difference I also decided to try it as a tea this time.  No matter what its combined with, the mushroom material always seems to make me very nauseous.
