Mental effects: music was AMAZING! I was listening to one of my favorite trance albums (Super8 & Tab  Empires) and the music was just pulsing thru me. It was so beautiful, but in no way overwhelming. There was a bit of time distortion  10 minutes would feel like half an hour. No real euphoria to speak of and no real ego loss. As far as visuals go, my vision pulsed a bit and there were some suggestions of fractals when I closed my eyes; watching the visualizer on VLC was really interesting, but there was nothing there that didnt belong.
