7:30 P.M. I was feeling highly euphoric, very highly euphoric, and began to touch myself just to experience this feeling. I began to wonder if this is going to be a very thought-less trip. I was feeling good, giggling for no reason, or perhaps because their voices sounded a little bit like they had inhaled helium. Time began its slow creep, and I was very focused on my euphoria. For some reason I thought that this was the peak, and after a few hours of feeling good, and giggly, I would just come down. At this point, my vision began to dance a little bit. The carpet began to melt a little bit, and the patterns on it began to emerge, as though speaking of their historic significance. J and D ordered some Chinese food, which arrived within half an hour.
