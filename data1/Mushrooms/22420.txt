We got the guitars back out, and while jamming, I remembered my sitar sitting up in my room. So I went to get it, and we jammed happily and beautifully to a song based on our various mushroom trips combined (under the name 'Psychedelic Maze'). We then went outside and smoked a joint together. Although the visuals had ebbed away, feeling the comfortable, trippy buzz from the weed combined with the ever-psychedelic effect of the shrooms made for a wonderfully relaxing come-down. After that, we went to bed, and I had closed-eye visuals until I fell into a deep, satisfied sleep.
