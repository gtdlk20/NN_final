T and I fasted on a mostly water and juice diet for 3 days prior to the trip to help purify ourselves. We decided that it would be best to eat the day of the experience so we would have the required energy. I loaded up my MP3 player with music that I loooove and figured would be thought provoking and comforting (the pixies, misfits, alkaline trio, AFI, the mars volta). To be quite honest, I've listened to a bunch of ambient and trance music that people often recommend on previous trips and it wasn't my cup of tea (to each his own I say). We didn't want a sitter, but as 'B' was a first timer he was only going to take 2 chunks, and we figured would be relatively able to call for help on my cell phone if shit hit the fan. As an additional precaution I got one of my other buddies to call us intermittently to make sure we were still doing ok.
