It may also be a direct message to potential energetic and/or trans-dimensional parasitic beings which attach themselves to human beings and cause sleep paralysis or as the medical community calls it, hypnopompic hallucinations. At least this is my personal theory, as I have suffered from sleep paralysis for 23 years. Though it should be noted, the condition weakened throughout the last 10 years and finally became rather rare since I woke up.
