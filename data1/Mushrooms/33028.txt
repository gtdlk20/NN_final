I just wanted to explore. I went to my backyard and looked up at the stars. It was an amazing site. Something you can't describe because it was so dark.. the sky was pitch dark like a peice of black paper, but the stars themselves were as bright as possible, all seeming like suns in brightness. That was when I realized how small I was. When I saw the stars I knew that I was considered nothing to the universe.. nothing but an ant. So I looked away. Turning my attention to instead of what could be seeing, and to what I was feeling. I saw energy, energy like when I am using a barbeque in the backyard and I watch the flames from the side, and I see the sqwiggly lines that make up invisible air, like its radiating heat. Noises seemed to let off these invisible vibrational lines that looked much like that. Every crack, every step echoed, with a force making me wonder whether or not I truely was as small as an ant, because it certainly didn't make me feel like one.
