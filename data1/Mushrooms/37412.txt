I opened my Gatorade and began to drink it because I was terribly thirsty and I felt as if I as a frog, but not completely, more like a half human half frog creature, maybe it was the way I was sitting. C's parents came and got her(we had found out that the sports bus wasnt coming till 8pm and it was 6pm)i was worried for her because we were still far from reality. I began to get lonley so I tried to talk to some freshmen, but I couldnt tell them that I was tripping. I ended up telling them that C's dad was a bus driver. Not what I wanted to do at all, and it wasnt even true.
