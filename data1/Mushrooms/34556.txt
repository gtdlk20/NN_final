(+1:00) I told all my friends that when we break the tree line and walk into the field, they will be overcome by one of the most incredible forces known to man and will probably feel better than they have ever felt. Now prepared, we walked through the last of the pine trees and onto the open field. Immediately, I felt the power of the open air and experienced a rush that I can describe only as awesome. We walked farther and farther onto the field where we all stopped and jammed for a little while, cranking our headphones loud and dancing in the middle of the open land like any true mushroom seeker knows how. It was a perfectly blue sky with the sun shining bright and we all felt the wonder of nature pulsing through us. I put on U2's epic rock ballad Pride (In the Name of Love) and closed my eyes, waiting for the fusion of music and energy to hit me. And oh did it hit me.
