I calmed down after a while and began to walk again.  Staring up at the sky, I saw what looked like reindeer made of stars flying across the sky above me.  They appeared slow moving, but I knew that was only because they were so far away.  They must be enormous, and moving so fast, I thought.  It was a very ominous, yet majestic sight.
