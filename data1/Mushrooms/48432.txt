Some how I get on the topic of life/death and God in my head.  I go through several phases at this point, although I don't exactly remember which order they go in.  At one point I was in heaven visiting all my family, and then it turned into 'Wait, there is no God.'  I came to the conclusion that I was stuck in the particular moment in time I was in, and that I was 'my' entity for that moment and I was stuck there forever.  I then some how rationalized that my thoughts are what keep me 'alive' however I started thinking I wasn't even alive.  I got in a mind loop as to how my thoughts come from God, and God's thoughts keep him real, but they are all just thoughts and somehow this meant that there was no God, no people, no nothing and that I was just a figment.
