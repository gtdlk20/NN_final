So I decided to completely stop breathing and focused on one tree. With deep concentration the aura stage shifted to a deeper level of perception where I could see a glowing centre of the tree that was outside of the material tree itself. Like I could see this glowing orb about a couple feet apart from the tree that was the trees centre. At this point I pulled back and told myself. This is not an illusion. What you are seeing is an actual phenomenon. I made sure to pull myself back to a regular state to emphasize and remind myself of this vision.
