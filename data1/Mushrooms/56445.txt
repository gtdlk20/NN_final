At the peak of our trips we sat in a huge field and watched the sunset. It was very beautiful and the wind felt great flowing around my body. The remainder of the trip was spent sitting around a fire and watching the fireworks. Most of my visuals where gone (2.5-3 hours in) but I still had some spatial distortion and more vivd colors. Everyone else still seemed to be pretty good as they ran around carefree lighting off fireworks and laughing at everything.
