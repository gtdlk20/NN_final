The only time I remember being scared by it was after my peak and everyone had already gone to sleep and I was wide awake.  I lay in bed trying to sleep, but the sound of my cousins computer tower on was bugging me out, and I kept feeling like If I didn't tell someone all the things I was feeling that I would explode, so I kept trying to suppress them and I would have some light visuals and my brain would be on a sort of stop and go.  Every time it stopped I felt anxious that it wouldn't start again.  That went on, with lots of shivering until I went to sleep.  I felt like I learned so much from that one experience.
