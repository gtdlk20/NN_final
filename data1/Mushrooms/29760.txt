Over the following years I went to university majoring in chemistry and later electronics engineering. I also raised a wonderful family. During the cold war I worked for 16 years, in Seattle, in electronics engineering with an emphasis on hydroacoustics (sonar) design. No point in saying, I am not a stoner.
