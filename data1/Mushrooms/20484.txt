Laying in the shade of a wide cedar, I feel the ground shudder and am letting go deeper and deeper into the Earth's frequency. I ask for healing. I intend transcendence of ordinary. I listen deeply. The rock layers shimmer and vibrate. All seems as it really is -totally alive. I walk slowly on being as being.
