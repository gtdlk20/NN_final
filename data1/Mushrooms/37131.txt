T +0:45 Visuals are just beginning and sense of time is deteriorating.  I notice light tracers when I wave my hands and the room seems to take on new dimensions.  I start to have a strange feeling of déjà vu, or coming home.  It is as if I have experienced the effects of mushrooms before and it is totally natural.
