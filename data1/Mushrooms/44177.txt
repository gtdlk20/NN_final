Going out of this experience, I am setting three more intentions: to continue my meditation practice to further develop the skill of equanimity, to approach others with an attitude of openness and acceptance to the best of my ability, and to not get too hung up on the inevitable change that occurs to everything and everybody in this universe. Overall, I am really proud of myself for being able to face down my demons and come out the other end, and of how well I managed to let go during the experience of ego-death. I have grown a lot in the two or three years since my previous mushroom encounter, when the same kind of experience left me very scared and confused. I am a better, stronger, wiser, and more integrated person after todays trip. Im sure it wont be the last!
