Im prone to say that I did end up getting high that night, even if I didnt realize it right away. I base my conclusion on the fact that I ended up eating an entire bag of chips myself, and then passing out on my friends bed while a movie played on the television in the background. Maybe about an hour later I squinted my eyes open to see these shadowy figures standing over me. In my state of mind, I immediately freaked out, forgetting where I was and thinking that crystal meth dealers had come to kill me. I panicked and fell off the bed, drawing everybodys attention before suddenly remembering where I was, causing me to laugh.
