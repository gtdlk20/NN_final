A laundry list of thoughts, both happy and sad, was racing through my mind. (e.g., why were we not right for each other when we both felt so connected, will I ever meet another human being who makes me feel so unique and do I really need that or is that just being insecure with myself, I am a happy and successful independent woman).   With the arising of each question seemed to come an answer, a subtle reminder of why.  Suddenly I began to cry.  I felt so overpowered by my surroundings and so thankful to be in that place at that very moment that I could not hold back my emotions.
