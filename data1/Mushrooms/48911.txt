I went outside to smoke a cigarette, sat down on the concrete patio, and leaned back against the building.  There was a lip on concrete pressing into my back, but I was so incredibly comfortable.  I kept putting my hands to my face or sucking on the top of my Coke bottle.  I have never felt better in my own body as I have on shrooms.
