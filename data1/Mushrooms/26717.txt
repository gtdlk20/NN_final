As I watched my surroundings, I began to feel an intense pressure on my body, all of it, as though I was being pulled from it. I tried to pretend that everything was ok, but every few seconds, a new pull would envelop me. I felt as though I was being pulled into another world. At the moment of the feeling, the periphery of my vision would explode with color, and I would actually move back a little bit. The room became so detailed before me that it looked like a painting. The faces of the Bart, Homer and Lisa, and later the cartoon of the woman from the Jeffersons began to show something more then what I had seen before, their faces began to come apart and discombobulate into colors and archetypical ideas of faces. I got up, in the middle of my adrenaline rush - panic that I would be pulled away from this world into ego death perhaps?? And decided to go outside for a cigarette. D joined me. In the hours that it took us to walk 10 feet to the elevator, I stared at her and wanted to tell her that her eyes were the most beautiful eyes imaginable. They sparkled with such clarity and such intense beauty. Her face was slowly coming apart into the basic colors from which it was manifested in my visual field.
