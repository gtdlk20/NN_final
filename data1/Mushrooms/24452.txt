All this time everything felt dreamy and unreal and I remember looking in the bathroom mirror and seeing my face In vivid contrasting colours like clown make up. My features were hilariously distorted and I didnÂ’t recognise myself at all. At one point gravity left all of us completely at the same time. The wall was the floor then the ceiling was the floor, it felt like we were stuck on the ceiling and I remember looking DOWN at the light shade. Unsettling.
