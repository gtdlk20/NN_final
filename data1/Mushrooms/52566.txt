32- The cake in intensive care is doing well. The hole [from surgery] has been overgrown. Hopefully we will be able to put it back in with the others in a couple of days. Tonight I'm going to try some for myself. I'm taking four mushrooms approximately 70mm long with caps 23mm in diameter. I ate them raw to see what they taste like. As expected, they tasted like raw mushrooms. Either you like them, or you don't. The trip took about an hour to kick in [I had just eaten dinner], and it peaked about 3 hours later. I had mild tracers and wall-bubbling, and for a while I closed my eyes and listened to some tunes. In the darkness, I had some wild mental imagery going on, and a good time was had by all. I found this to be a comfortable first dose. [I'm 5'11' 180lbs]
