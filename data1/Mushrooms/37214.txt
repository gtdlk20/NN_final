I felt myself sinking into the Earth, felt it's friendly guiding touch massaging my body as a re-assurance that in spite of my insignifigant size, I am still as valuable to the Earth as it is to me. I could feel the world spinning beneath me as I watched the sky explode in a fireworks show brought to me by the same source of the mushrooms; thinking of this made me feel privelaged to be shown so much beauty by the Earth, it made me confident in Nature's ability to control everything in this world for better or ill, and awoke my spiritual senses of how much power guides this universe has flowing through it's veins that no Bible could ever tap into.
