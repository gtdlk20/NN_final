We ended up deciding to go out for a walk for some air (not a good idea). There were so many people out walking, and I somehow felt bigger and stronger than everyone else. The houses looked like doll houses and I felt giant, and that I didn't fit in. I saw a man walking by me and he had the face of a zombie, a scary zombie with a black hollow face. I was so scared, I couldn't continue the walk, I had to turn around and get home.
