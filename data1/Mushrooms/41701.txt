At some point I had decided that it would be cool to watch Alice in Wonderland tripping, so I had put it on my vcr. I looked up at the screen from my bed and laughed my ass off at all the characters and the NONSENSE of it all... but strangely, it all made PERFECT SENSE to me, and I understood that movie better than ever - and I've watched it, almost religiously, since I was a baby. All of sudden, though, Alice began looking a bit fuzzy and the whole Tv screen was just.. off. So at that point, which was an hour after I had first started eating the mushrooms, I went into my bathroom, right down the hall. Oh-my-god. I don't think I've ever seen my pupils that big, and they were getting bigger! I mean, they've been extremely dilated many times before this, but even on high doses of dxm I don't think they were that large. I have blue eyes, but they were completely black! It was crazy, and I loved it. I'm not sure what I was doing in the bathroom, I think I was just staring into the mirror for 10 minutes.
