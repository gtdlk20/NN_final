Why did I do this what have I done? Before I felt like I'd have to go to a mental hospital, my brain was going to explode. Questioning everything I've ever believed. I'm feeling much better now and I will still say I love mushrooms and will definitely do them again. To enter the level I get on when I'm tripping is just an amazing experience and I've learned so much. This past trip taught me how to deal with these emotions and just help it make me a better person. Only now, I'll only trip with people I know well and who are also tripping with me. That's the most fun and best way. Other than that, respect these drugs, they aren't for everyone, but if used in the right setting they are a life changing experience.
