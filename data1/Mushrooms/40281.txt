T+2:50: S is tired so we go back to our table and sit down. I feel fine, probably because Im in much better shape than S, and Im a more experienced and durable tripper. I have some I water, over the course of the night I am constantly seeking out any liquid to quench my killer dry mouth, and soothe my rather uncomfortable stomach. Im not nauseous, my stomach stays in constant discomfort regardless of what Im doing, whether Im sitting standing or dancing. S is still moving around quite a bit.
