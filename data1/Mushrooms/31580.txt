I continue to walk asking questions. Some I wrote down in preparation for the experience... The mushroom answered all of them such the nature of consciousness I continued to ask Why again and again to each answer and got deep into the inner workings of nature. I continued to ask Why again and again to each answer and got deep into the inner workings of nature. Colours were brighter than ever. Sun shining through the trees was benevolent and the hue of the natural colours would shift and change from reds and oranges to yellows and purples and so on. My mind flowed peacefully. I would often stop and place my hands on things and just stare. Questions would pop into my mind and I would ponder amazed at what the mushroom and I would come up with. Tunes to songs I could make up on the spot filled my head followed by more questions. Further up the track I stopped with a friend, Jim, and I ask if he can see the flowing trees. He could not but explains to me that this is flowing time calving out the valleys and mountains. The mushroom laughs in my head my thoughts go I Can see why females find him attractive  Hes passionate about things.
