Recently, a friend of mine informed me that he knew someone who just got in a huge supply of mushrooms. So we, as well as my boyfriend, decided to shroom during the weekend at another friend's house. When we got the mushrooms, my boyfriend and I split an eighth and my friend had an eighth to himself (he's a big guy...). We decided to make them into a tea since I had never tea'd mushrooms before. When the tea was ready, we drank it down (around midnight) and smoked a little weed. Well, I soon discovered that mushroom tea kicks in very fast, as opposed to just eating them. When mushrooms are eaten it takes roughly 30 minutes to an hour to start working. With the tea, it was only about 10 minutes or so before I was tripping. It started off a little weird...
