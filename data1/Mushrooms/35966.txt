The song ended, and I stopped crying and just sat up in bed with my eyes open, and said 'wow'.  J said 'whatever just happened, it must have been wonderful!'  I told him it was, and tried to tell him about it while we had a cigarette.  He told me that he found his spirit guide (who he called his 'protector') a long time ago, in a different way.  We talked about how every person needs to find God on their own terms, and that's why neither one of us belong to a religion or believe in organized religion.  I've always felt very spiritual, but not sure what my beliefs or ideas were.
