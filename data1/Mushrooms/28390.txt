Ive done psilocybin mushrooms a handful of times before this experience, but this one was by far the most intense.  My roommate and I both wanted to up the ante this time around by not only each taking an eighth, something neither of us had done before, but also by trying something Ive read about online called the lemon tek method.  This method involves grinding up the shrooms as finely as possible and mixing them into lemon juice (or something comparatively acidic; I tend to use lime juice as I think its more acidic but it probably doesnt matter). Ive done this before with half an eighth and the trip was noticeably more intense than usual; I felt as if I briefly came in contact with some sort of female entity/deity for the first time.
