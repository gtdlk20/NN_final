Except that he didnt somehow like my presence. Because I think at that moment I angered him greatly by me laughing at this great spectacle. He constricted my body and I felt my vitals give out. My breathing slowly stopped and I felt my heart slow to a stop. It was then that I fell back on to my bed, and died. I felt into my eyes and felt no pain. I was hoping that [in real life] I wasnt ripping my eyes out.
