ItÂ’s interesting to note that I hardly touch on the visual aspect of this trip, or any of them for that matter. When someone is initially interested in doing psychedelics it is primarily for the visual, and synaesthesia aspects of the drug, but it is not even close to being the important aspect of these drugs. I had extremely intense visuals throughout this whole mushroom trip, and while I enjoyed them at times, and was quite frightened by them at times, that part of the trip was completely overshadowed by the intense cognitive effects and banishing of my ego.
