Bought 1/2 an ounce (14 grams) of some, later to be discovered, very unpotent mushrooms from a fellow at work with the intent to ingest them sometime that week. About 3 days later, Saturday, I talk a walk to the local convience store and get some OJ, a pack of marboro, and a weekly world news, and walk home. I divide out about half of the mushrooms (Approximately 7 grams) and take a sip of OJ, put the mushrooms in my mouth and begin chewing. Orange juice completely kills the somewhat earthy not too unpleasant but far from appetizing taste of the mushies. Take about 5 minutes to thouroughly chew and swallow all the mushies. About 20 minutes begin to feel the familiar tryptamine buzz. I put on a Parliament Funkadelic compilation CD. After about 30 minutes I feel them completely take effect and put the cd in my discman, headphones on, and go for a walk through the paths in the woods. I am barefoot and the ground is mooshy from recent rain. I walk through this path for an hour or so, enjoying the beatiful hues of the forest. Smoke a few cigarettes along the way and walk back home. I watch some tv. Lay on my kitchen floor for most of the remainder of the trip enjoying the music and smoking some more cigs.
