It seemed like a miracle when the 507 finally pulled up to the curb. Once the bus was on its way, I looked out the window at the marsh, the pine trees. The marsh looked like it was moving, just like the sand was. The trees looked like cardboard cutouts. I felt like I could see passing buildings before actually passing them, kind of like stop motion. When I looked at my hands, they looked distorted, like a pixelated image.
