Earlier this year I watched the documentary, Neurons to Nirvana on Netflix, and was very impressed. I then read an amazing booked called The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide, by James Fadiman. I also did some reading about the recent resurgence of psychedelic medicinal research around the world, and its potential for such varied maladies as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, OCD, helping terminal cancer patients with the anxiety involved in their impending death, major depressive disorder, etc. (The cancer study was done at Johns Hopkins, the top medical school/center in the US.)
