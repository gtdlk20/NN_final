One hour after I had taken the mushrooms I went to the bathroom too pee, and as I was sitting on the toilet I looked at my wall and saw something moving.  It was in fact, a frog that started to push its way out of the wall, looked at me, winked and said, 'See you later!'  It didn't seem out of the ordinary.
