A surprisingly warm night pleased my nerves as I stepped out of my damp garage and walked down my driveway toward the perpendicular road. I wondered what might have been here before it was desecrated and replaced with these singular accommodations. I followed the establishment down a fairly steep road, my D.A.R.E. shirt providing the ideal amount of warmth for my body. The sky was beginning to darken; I guessed it would have been dark by the time I got back to my house. A few minutes after watching four consecutive white cars pass me; I saw a dampened image of a figure riding towards me. Realizing it was her, I continued my slow paced walk until I casually caught up with her.
