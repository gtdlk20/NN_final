I think it dramatically helped me get my head in the right place, and aided my mental toughness when it comes to my sport, long distance running. I had been unable to completely expend all my energy in races, and I realized this was because I was not living in the race as much as I should be. These amazing mushrooms cured one of my biggest problems in a single night. I eventually went upstairs, and entered the bathroom. I watched myself in the mirror, as everything around me seemed to inhale and exhale. I looked at my face and was enamored for nearly 10 minutes, looking at my own eyes.
