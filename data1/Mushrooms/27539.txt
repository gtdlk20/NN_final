Myself and four friends traveled into the night to our 'spot' (a grass covered hill overlooking my home town). An ounce of mushrooms were pulled out of a backpack and divied up to their respective owners. I got two 8ths of it. Previously we had bought some snacks as chasers, so the shrooms wouldn't taste so bad (a definite must). I got a candybar, put the shrooms on top and downed it. After I had consumed all of the mushrooms I sat there in the grass and anticipated the oncoming trip. After about 30-40 minutes I started to get an intense body trip. My friends watched me try to walk but fail, it was as if I had been drinking shot after shot until I could no longer control my speech or motor skills. I could lean on one friend and try to explain what was going on. They expressed little concern with my 'problem' and tried to get me off of them.
