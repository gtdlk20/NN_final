So I go into subway, buy a sub, put 5 units of shrooms on it. I walk around town a bit, about 15 minutes or so, stuff seems slightly more interesting at this point. My brother is a genius when it comes to drugs. At a school near my house the walls were really cheep and when you hit them they make this wierd 'Bloop' noise. My brother took me here and we were entertaining our selves for a good 20 minutes laughing uncontrollably. We proceeded to home, normally this short half hour walk went by quickly, but it seemed that it never ended, it felt like we must have been walking to home for at least an hour and a half. On our way we were laughing at some of the most stupidest things, I can't recall what, but they were there. After getting home we laid down in my room and stared at one of my posters, it began turning 'electronic'. Another 5 minutes it seemed went by, and my tv and speakers appeared to be moving as if possessed by demons, but I felt calm. It was at this point that silence was really cool for no reason at all.
