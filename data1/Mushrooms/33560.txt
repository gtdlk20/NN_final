After walking around for maybe 10 minutes I just have to lay down, I see so many things that I can't safely move around in this physical world. My friend stays up and walks around enjoying the visuals while keeping an eye on me laying on the ground. This is where I really start loosing grip of time. It feels like an eternity but according to a photo my friend took and estimates of the onset this episode is around 3 hours.
