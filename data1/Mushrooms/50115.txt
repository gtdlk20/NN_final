Firstly a little background information about me Â– 20-year-old male living with my parents in a small leafy town in the north of England. Early last year I was diagnosed with a schizo - affective disorder and spent a period of 6 months in a mental institution. I have been out of hospital for around 8 months now and (through the use of medication) I live a normal life and suffer none of the symptoms which got me institutionalised. Currently taking the anti psychotic risperidone and also sleeping tablets, zopiclone.
