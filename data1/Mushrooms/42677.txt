11.	I close my eyes again and a mask in front of me is coming off, then math just starts pouring into my very being then I see a man in a suit, facing me with a smile on his face. However, I could only see up to the bottom before the eyes began, his head had no top it looked like a chalice, the voice started again and the man in the suit said, you are me, I am you, we are one as he was saying this I went into him, him into me, then us being one .  At this moment I was never born and I never died I always was, I AM.
