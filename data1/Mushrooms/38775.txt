A quick note on surrounding circumstances: at the time, I had a broken arm from a bike accident, which was in a full-arm cast and still painful when it was moved. I had been smoking marijuana and hash frequently through the whole trip (most of a month at that point, often several times a day), so there was a fair amount of THC in my system, but had not smoked that day because I didn't want interfering factors (and I found amsterdam grass to be too heavy/indica-like for my tastes, and rolling a joint with a broken arm is a huge pain in the ass). I was extremely sleep-deprived, because every hostel bed and hotel/pension room was booked when I arrived, so I stayed up all night in a bar the first night. Finally, it should be noted that I was traveling alone, did not speak any foreign languages fluently, and had been through 3 countries in about a week, a major disorienting factor. Amsterdam was the first place I had come where I could communicate with a majority of people.
