Background Â– I am an very seasoned psychedelic user, with most of my experience from LSD and 5-meo-dipt, and less experience with P. cubensis mushrooms, Amanita mushroom, AMT, and ecstasy.  Although I consider myself experienced (at one point I would trip two to three times week on lsd and foxy), my frequency has fallen off to taking a psychedelic about once a year.  This trip was my second and final trip of 2005.  Both times were with the same batch of P. cubensis mushrooms.  They were taken dried in chocolate.
