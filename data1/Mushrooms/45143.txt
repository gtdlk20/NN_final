Back to my mind; I lose all sense of time, I lose ego, everyting gone. I look side to side as I'm traveling through time itself. I hear my parents, grandparents, co-workers; I thank them for this feeling. I see einstein and he tells me, 'WE are one.' I feel as if every person's mind is connected. I have ultimate knowledge.
