Existence doesnt exist either! There is no existence! I became fascinated with the duality of existence/non-existence. I realized that everything exists and does not exist, simultaneously. This was all very reminiscent of DMT. I realized that life is this amazing gift, that nothing really matters but that everything matters. Everything is an illusion and nothing really exists, so it doesnt actually matter what happens in this illusory world. Whatever happens, is perfect. And yet, at the same time I can feel my existence. My existence feels real, and I am having this experience of being alive. That experience, the experience of living, and existing, is really quite a profound gift. In fact, its the greatest gift ever! I get to be alive, and experiencing and being with these people who love me and who I love back, and we are all water, because water is love too. No matter what happens, I knew that everything was okay, everything was perfect exactly the way it is. Existing and not existing at the same time.
