After that I entered THE ROOM, quiet, clean, pure bordered space and although THE ROOM stayed the same it changed constantly. During the whole journey I was very confident, peaceful and totally without fear. THE ROOM stayed and from time to time the vibes of THE ROOM wanted to change to a wrong vibe, I just didn't cooperate and the room changed back (afterwards I found out that at those moments my friend was going in a wrong direction with the possibility to go very wrong and the feeling of insanity). Light started to radiate. There were white transparent flat forms floating through the air. The light in the room kept changing, brighter, golden. The impression of South American designs everywhere.
