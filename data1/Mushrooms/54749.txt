Rather quickly, time became irrelevant. The ups are hot, I sweat.  The downs are cold, I shiver. I feel the euphoria take over me.  It is hard to handle the feeling, it is so powerful. I feel the euphoria take over me.  It is hard to handle the feeling, it is so powerful. Tracers, morphing, geometric patterns break away into a trance-like state.  I am able to see whatever I want to see. I begin to have visions of Aztek rituals.  I see why they eat the sacred mushroom, it is simply to feel the love of God, and to feel closer to him.  The Aztek shaman I am conversing with asks me to come with him. We leave the festival, and walk into the wilderness. The shaman leaves me, I don't know where he has gone. I see more primitive people.  They are just like us. They do not wear clothing. They too, are consuming the mushrooms.
