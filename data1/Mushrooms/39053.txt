The mushroom 'Alien/God' that communicates matches all bible descriptions of God.  'Alien' or 'God,' whatever you prefer to call It, is very friendly and not as commanding as may seem.  When I was not prophesizing and was merely making friendly conversation I spoke in 'tongues'.  I could not begin to type or write to even come close to the sounds of this strange language in which I could speak fluently.  I called it under-tongue for lack of a better word, until I looked it up on the net when my trip was over.  It has been said throughout Catholic and Christian times that speaking in tongues is a blessing from the holy spirit.  Many, in biblical times, used to 'speak in tongues and prophesize with God.'  These tongues are only used to communicate with this 'Alien.'  There werenÂ’t words for material things like normal language.  It felt so natural to speak like this.  I can't speak in tongues when I am not in the mushroom experience.  This language seemed to be the evolution of language and seemed to continue to evolve.
