Then after looking at this I start to hyperventilate and convulse. I shut my eyes and saw DMT-like visions, then my hands began to vibrate. It grew stronger and stronger and stronger. My friend had no idea the intensity of the situation. The ecstatic euphoria was raging through my entire body. I was overwhelmed with euphoria. I stood up and tried to channel more, it grew. I am exalted with incredible euphoria, I can barely stand it. I yell, 'I am the shaman, I will heal any disease for you, do you need anything cured?' My friend did not take my words seriously, I instantly felt stupid. I tried to calm down and let the euphoria wear off.
