Learning about cultivation took a great deal of online reading over the course of a few months followed by some trial and error. Overall I followed a combination of two or three beginners cultivation instructions (TEKs). I used a pre-made starter substrate kit, used a strain of  P. Cub, used a shotgun chamber, and kept a cultivation journal. I ended up with no contamination, despite my wife telling me on a number of occasions that I was not being sterile/clean enough.
