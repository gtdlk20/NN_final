Carissa fell asleep some time around 4 or 5 Saturday morning, but Wally and I considered that too early and since he had to go to work in 7 hours, sleep was more or less out of the question. This is important to remember when I describe my trip; I had not slept or eaten in close to 36 hours when I took my 1/8th. Feel free to smack your forehead and call me a retard now. So the mushrooms came without difficulty but with much surprise, and news of a meteor shower that was supposed to be 'pretty fuckin heavy, dude'. I wish it was that easy to describe now.
