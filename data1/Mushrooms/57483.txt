I've tripped about four times before and each was beautiful and strange in it's own way. I have been trying to find shrooms in my area for about a year and when a friend told me about some I bought an 1/8 without hesitation. I took the day off of work today and at 7:35 a.m. Est I ingested the 1/8 (on an empty stomach). I have no problem with the taste at all.
