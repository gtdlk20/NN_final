It was a Sunday evening, about 6:00 P.M., and I was very bored, sitting at my computer and exchanging instant messages with my friends. At some point, my friend Jake sent me a message asking me if I wanted to buy some mushrooms off of him. Jake is known for being a) loaded, b) generous, and c) incredibly well connected to many local sources of many different kinds of drugs. Thus, he was willing to sell me an eighth of the ounce he had just bought for a mere 35 dollars. Aside from a generosity, the large amount of drugs in my upper-middle class suburban town  somewhat diminishes the price of any drug around here.
