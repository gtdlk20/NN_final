This experience happened to me almost a year ago today, I was just reminiscing and decided to share it with my fellow psyconaughts.  It was one of those spitfire trips.  You know the kind, 'Hey man I got some real good shrooms wanna trip with me?'  'Shure I've got nothing to do.' This was one of those.
