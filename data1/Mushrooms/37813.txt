I finished a whole Pink Floyd cd and started to write poetry. feeling very creative and like positive energy was emitting from my body. Visual hallucinations are intense and I feel like i am on Cocaine, Heroin, And MDMA without thier negative effects. I tried to visit with family, but felt like they were thinking i was a wierdo. I was grinning non-stop so i went back to my room. Much of this trip was spent on my back almost unable to move. I felt very much like I was acting like Ozzy Osbourne.
