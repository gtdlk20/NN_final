After about an hour or so, my friend slowly brought me out of my trance and she told me this, 'Are you ready to come back to this world?'. Initially I wasn't and I told her to give me awhile, because I did not want to leave. But eventually I accepted that this magic world couldn't last forever and it was time to return to the real world so I took her hand and she brought me back. I opened my eyes and looked around at my friends and began to soak in the atmosphere of everything around me. My friend said, 'It's okay. This will be a different kind of trip now'. I initially thought I was coming down, but then the second part of my journey began.
