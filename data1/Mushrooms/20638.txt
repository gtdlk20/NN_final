I forget what the next couple exchanges were exactly, but I know I had a lot of questions about what it meant to exist and what my role was in a universe so much bigger than myself. At some point, the patterns in my mind froze in place and color began to seep in. What I saw looked a lot like the pattern on a blue tie-dye shirt, though the blues on this field were so rich and vibrant you really can't make sense of them unless you are in that state. It is very much like trying to describe color to a blind person, only sober you is that blind person.
