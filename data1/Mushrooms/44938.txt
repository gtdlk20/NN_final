All of a sudden my friend asked me, 'what is this stuff, what is popcorn.' You've probably never really looked at popcorn but it is pretty weird stuff. To think that a little kernel of corn exploded making itself inside out and then had flavoring put on it. Real weird. We laughed for ahwile about this.
