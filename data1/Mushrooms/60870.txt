My friends' 18th birthday was approaching and we decided to celebrate by having our first real mushroom trip. The morning of, my buddies and I set out to buy. We ended up with a good count which resulted in all three of us consuming 3.5 g each. We did this on near-empty stomachs about 15 minutes before eating dinner with the birthday boy's parents in their kitchen. When my pals B, D, and myself were halfway through dinner I started to feel a sort of anxiousness. Near the end of dinner, I took a glance at the butter container, which depicted two smiling slices of bread, one with a butter knife. The one with the knife began to stab the other one, yet both retained their little smirks. That made me realize we shouldn't be hanging around people's parents at the moment. I bolted up out of my chair and tried to casually walk downstairs, ignoring the intense headrush induced by standing.
