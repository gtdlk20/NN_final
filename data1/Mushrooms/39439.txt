I was able to speak and doing fine just having fun. A bunch of things happened as we went in and I started to think (a lot). Everything that was happening, I felt was the opposite was going on. Someone came up to my sister and was asking questions, and I was so paranoid the whole time. I actually thought he was a cop busting her for something, not until later she told me that he was really doing a survey for something. Unless you've tripped before I can't explain the weird thoughts that run through your head and how you feel. But it's probably ten times stronger than you can even imagine. You are completely not in this world. Physically, yeah, but on such different level reality of thought then the rest. It's very hard to communicate.
