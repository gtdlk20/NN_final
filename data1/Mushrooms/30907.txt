As I write this it is one year later. I have had several opportunities to repeat these experiences. Each time I have been in no hurry. One of the remarkable things about LSD and Psilocybin is that they are not addictive or habit forming. But, if I have had a good trip I may find that I want to replicate it. I donÂ’t do this expecting the same experiences. I may be disappointed. I can return to the same setting, but always try to find new surprises. It is so important to be patient and to wait for the best time and place.
