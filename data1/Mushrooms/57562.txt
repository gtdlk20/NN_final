We ate these small dried and duffy shrooms in our beautiful surroundings of pine trees, large rocks, and sounds of a waterfall.  That sunny day nature inhaled us into its lung and we pulsated in rhythm with our surroundings.  We became one with everything, there was no separation.  As the trip progressed and revealed to us its patterns and sheer love, we found we no longer needed to talk to one another.  We no longer needed to discuss anything in a verbal manner.  We were synchronized, our movements to different areas of the forest and the places we stopped to absorb, became understood in us both.  We didn't have to ask each other which direction to move, where to lay down, how each other were doing with this trip, if we needed water or not.  It was understood with out any hesitation.
