The nausea hit alongside with confusion of where I was and some pesky visuals (in terms of finding the way). But my spirit was surprisingly high. I thought that theres the river, the party is at the river and I live very close to the river - stay by the river. I decided to walk with my bicycle and found after some hundred meters that I had been walking the opposite direction for quite a while. Then S. approached on her bike and I waved at her enthusiastically then became convinced thats not her but a middle aged man cycling quietly but then it turned out it is her and I told her that I was already feeling a good deal of effects. So we kept on cycling to the party and arrived there around 11 p.m.
