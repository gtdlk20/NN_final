A mile or so later, closer to my place I climbed the hill to my street and laid on the grass in the dark behind a statue. I needed a few moments longer still to get my shit together before navigating neighborhood streets and potential run-ins with random people. After the past several hours on my own (my prefered method of tripping) I spent some time thanking various people in my life, praying for peace, and generally giving myself an attitude check. For me, this is my reason for doing this. Its a chance to reset the switches and recharge the spirit. Its such a shame that the powers in charge are not able to see and understand the potential for allowing human kind to have psychedelic experiences. To think what we could accomplish if there was a sanctioned means to experience this!
