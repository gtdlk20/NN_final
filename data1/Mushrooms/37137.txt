T +2:00 Lisa, who has been upstairs with J returns to the basement and the lights are turned back on.  She and Shawn start a game of pool while E and I stare at the room.  The intense movement in the pictures and the dimensions of the walls are interrupted only by EÂ’s periodic outbursts of laughter, which I find very amusing.
