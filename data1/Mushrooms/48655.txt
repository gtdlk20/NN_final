I wake up to the phone ringing, I'm glad to hear my girlfriends voice, exactly what i needed o hear after a long trip to hell and back. The rest of the day I've had a very nice after glow. i feel VERY refreshed. almost as if all the bad thoughts i once had had been flushed out of my body. i will try this again when the time is right, but i think i will step it down to 5 grams, mckenna style.
