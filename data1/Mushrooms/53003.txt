One of the first things I noticed (aside from the crawling carpet) was how tense I was, especially in my neck and back. I then began to realize how anxious and tense I had been for some time. Almost immediately I began to hear another voice in my head...I wondered why my body felt so shitty, and the voice explained a number of factors in my life that had contributed to that. I felt sleepy, dreamy, and I succumbed to the urge to close my eyes. I began to enter a trance state. At first I hallucinated glowing 3-D molecules, strings of neon light and layers of iridescent, netlike fabric- but these soon gave way to heavier shit.
