12:45 a.m. I crashed on my bed and was put into a vast world of closed eye visuals. I saw cowboys and Indians fighting, cats and dogs were chasing each other, fire and rain trying to empower one another. I saw things that were opposites of each other fighting. This made me think a lot. I remember thinking that life was short and that we need to make the best out of it and just standing around and watching things happens is not enough, or at least for me it isnÂ’t. I then saw stars, galaxies, nebulas and solar systems that made me think how huge the universe is and how happy I was to be taking an astronomy course. I saw so many visuals but can only remember a few. I began to come down.
