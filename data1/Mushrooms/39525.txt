Now the state of mind at this point...was one of amazement, but too much amazement and I became confused. I was having a hard time wrapping my brain around the concepts and ideas that were shooting in and out of my head at 200mph.  It was very overwhelming.  My thoughts and senses became so greatly intensified that making sense of it all was very difficult.  if you start to think about something like the complexities of the universe, your train of thought will quickly spiral out of control and overwhelm you.  It wasn't necessarily a bad thing, just sort of unsettling.
