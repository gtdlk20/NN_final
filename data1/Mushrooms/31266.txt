At around 2:00am we both got back into bed with the bathroom light being the only source of light in the room. It was a very cozy environment, full of positive vibes and contentment. The straight lines where the door connects to the wall started to wave and become more vibrant for me, I always use such methods to gauge how far gone I am into a trip. I figured at this point that things were not going to get anymore intense than this, and I was happy with that. Instead of chasing some kind of hallucination visual frenzy, I was content and happy, cozy with my gf in bed.
