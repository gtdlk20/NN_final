The previous time I had taken mushrooms in a similar setting I had not dealt with the whole thing very well. It had been too overwhelming, too powerful and I had felt inclined to stop myself going mad. I was far too tense, but I had learnt from this. I needed, if I was going to cross the threshold, to let go, to forget my ego, let myself see what was on the other side instead of constantly trying to pull away from it. I find that the setting adds considerably to the content of your trip. I had been to the same place twice before, a 24 hour club that incorporated a play, some dance floors, a vast expanse of chill-out areas (many were shoe-free, alcohol-free and tobacco-free zones, which didn't bother me), a sort kind of street decorated with shop upon shop, which, as the evening progresses, becomes a central focal point to meet people or regroup. The whole thing is set in a mass of tunnels, usually used as car-parks, but which, for one night become another world. It is not so much a club, but more of a plain, a community which exists by the outside world but not with it. Once you are in, it does not feel like anywhere, and yet you are there. For me, it is heaven, a heaven with bad bits and good bits. The tunnels are virtually bear, and the only things that hide the crumbling brick and cement the place is made out of are the psychedelic stalls, painting, decorations, virtual D.J screens, and of course, the people. It all gets a bit complicated, but things will become clearer as the report progresses.
