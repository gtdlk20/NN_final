I remember we were feeling tired and worn out so Dee wanted to go to bed. We were still tripping and were still in awe and disbelief. All of a sudden Dee yells at me, by now I am completely disconnected from reality and am in a blackout haze of confusion. He yelled that I pissed on his couch. It must have had something to do with me blocking my bodyÂ’s ability to feel bladder discomfort.
