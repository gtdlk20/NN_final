I died and disintegrated into pieces, and had realized that I had somewhere along the line grown 6 extra arms, because I could use them to feel my broken body. My hearing became really high pitched, like the hearing after a rock concert, it was constantly ringing. I thought (more like it was plausible that I could barely hear them) I could hear my parents say what is wrong with you son?, and I heard them say that they were going to be there for me when I died. I was hoping that [in real life] they hadnt appeared in my room because I was incapacitated and couldnt respond. The entire time I knew the shrooms were promoting this paranoia, so I felt agitated. I reassured myself that my parents had not gone into my room while I was tripping, and that I was not mortally wounded. This was the hardest part of the trip where it had gone uneasy but not frightful.
