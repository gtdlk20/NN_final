We came to a little opening beside like a pond, it had stopped raining at this point and it was honestly way too early to head back home. We decided to re-set up camp in this little spot and just chill for a bit. I'd say this is where I really peaked.  I'm going to say it was around an hour after eating the mushrooms. My thoughts were racing from one thought to the next, nothing even really deep even. I can't say I had any real visuals but my depth perception was allll messed up. I remember one spot specifically when we were hiking and like the path ahead of me almost looked like it was going upwards and like it was all smushed like it was a 2Dimensional picture or something.
