I had definitely lost control over my thoughts. A very quick succession of thoughts, emotions, wondering about visuals rushed through me. Each lasting only a moment before being washed away by the next one. I couldnt help but walk up and down in front of the cabin, dealing with the thoughts and impressions and questions that were not always pleasant. Things like: How are you treating your girlfriend?. Then feeling sorry for a mother that sees her child leaving home. Then the telling-off again: Why dont you bring your life in order?. Followed by being stunned by the beauty of deep green and dark bark lying next to each other. I think none of these chunks of pictures-emotion-question staccato lasted for longer than probably 2 seconds. It was very exhausting and got even faster and at one point, I failed to formulate or grasp the questions and impressions anymore, it was like being juggled around. Like a bug on a leaf on a mountain creek. I was only a stunned bystander of myself.
