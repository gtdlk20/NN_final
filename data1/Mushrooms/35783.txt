Then, two days before ingestion, a bombshell was dropped on me: Z's cousin, Y, wanted to join in.  I made my reservations known.  I was opposed to this change in plans for two reasons.  Firstly, with another person in the group my share of shrooms would be lessened.  Secondly, having a new person in the group, who I did not know very well and did not like very much, was unnerving.  I thought that, in the midst of the experience, she might have a bad reaction.  A & Z had both done shrooms before with no serious problems.  Myself and Y were the only newbies.  Selfishly, I did not want my first time to be ruined by someone else's first time.  My sister understood my fears and also recognized the risk of Y freaking out, but as Z was resposible for acquiring the shrooms, we could not reasonably refuse her entrance.
