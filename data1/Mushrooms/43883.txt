I remember thinking that I was uncomfortable and that I wanted the trip to end.;q I remember I was talking out loud trying to figure out how much longer I was going to be high for but I couldn't for the life of me figure out basic math. I'm not sure how long we were at this second spot for but after a while we decided to pack up and head towards the car again.
