10:25: I am looking at light reflections on the wall that I have never noticed so vividly before, wondering if it was working or if this was me wanting it to work, when all of a sudden, out of the corner of my eye, I see a picture on the wall twist and hang at a different angle. Within minutes of this all of the pictures are glowing with color and swaying, the window is taking deep breaths, the mounted deer head on the wall we had named 'buck' was singing along w/ led zeppelin, and the two of us are on the ground laughing hysterically.
