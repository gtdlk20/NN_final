We got into the theater and found our seats about 15 rows up. As we sat there, I began feeling as if every single person in the entire theater knew that we were on mushrooms and was whispering about us, paranoid much? Unfortunately, given the movie we chose, there was a larger than average number of children in the audience, which was seriously weirding me out considering I am a nanny by trade. I felt like all the parents were talking about me and thinking 'How can she possibly care for children for a living when she has the audacity to show up to a children's movie on mushrooms?!'
