'Medulla' playing, just into the early stages I reflected on the utter clarity of mind mushrooms bring, I feel totally in the moment with no thoughts at all other than the immediacy of existence through all senses, focus is completely on just the reception of information. I focused on creating a 'Swirls' picture with the felt pens in my notebook, which after declaring it finished I would eventually fuck up by over-ornamenting it. I added to the 'L' shaped pattern again, which is still not finished!
