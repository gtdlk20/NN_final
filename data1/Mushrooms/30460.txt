We went to the restroom in shifts, since we had nice stuff with us, and had an entire little area set up.  And each time wed separate it was nice alone time, which I always need on a trip.  I went into the building to go to the restroom, Id never been in this building on campus, and it was AMAZING!  It was bright yellow and red and black inside, and very geometric and I was just walking through the quiet halls tripping on all the simple echoes and shapes and colors.  It just felt almost like I wasnt real, and this world wasnt real, and was all just a fantasy, and although I knew the experience partially was a fantasy, I knew this world was real.  I thought it was amazing.
