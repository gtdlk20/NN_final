 At that point I dispersed into black microscopic crystals across a dark void. I floated around in this void for a second or a year, time didnÂ’t exist. I existed but only as my basic essence with no attachments to the real world or even the universe. I was everything that existed, there was nothing else.  I was outside the universe. I hoped that Sue and Kate had not gotten to this point because I knew it could be terrifying to them. (I could see how some people could see this as the Death of the ego, but I never felt that way and I had no doubt that I would return.)
