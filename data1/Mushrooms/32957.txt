Now I was already clearly seeing everything around me dancing with living spiritual energy by the time less than an hour and a half had passed, and it wasnÂ’t fading away or stopping once until I came down 6 hours later. In fact, after this began, all of visual reality seemed to lose its solidity in my senses. Solid, liquid, and gas seemed to lose meaning, as I felt one with the world around me, and everything seemed to be made of pure energy, to be shaped by the active will of God and all living things together in unity. Change was constant and nothing was necessarily static or constant from one moment to the next.
