I got up out of my bed and decided that I had to leave the room. This was getting out of hand. I was feeling a mixture of hopelessness, fear, confusion, and gloom. 'Maybe I should head to the kitchen and get some water'. So I opened my door, walked a few steps into the hallway, then came back into my room. 'I should probably get some water'. Opened the door. Stepped into the hallway. Stepped back into the room. Another thought loop. At this point I thought I was losing my mind. I thought that if by some chance I didn't die, then there was no way I was leaving this trip with my sanity still intact. I thought that if by some chance I didn't die, then there was no way I was leaving this trip with my sanity still intact. After a couple of minutes of aimlessly wandering around my hallway and living room I returned to my room in a depressive state, slowly accepting that I have truly messed up and it had either cost me my life or my sanity. Or both.
