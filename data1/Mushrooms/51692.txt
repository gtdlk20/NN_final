We drove around and looked for Julia after that because we did realize that she could have gone anywhere if she had lost her mind relatively as badly as we had.  We couldn't find her and assumed that she had found her home because we had, even though she had no one else there.  We were still tripping hard and went back to Tiff's to cool down.  We watched the walls melt until around six in the morning when Ian decided that he needed to go home.  I watched the trees all around me growing and moving and knew that I was too afraid to be alone.  Tiff stayed at my house and the only thing that could comfort my eyes to sleep, around nine a.m., was thinking about vanilla frozen yogurt.   I slept for a while and woke up still tripping hours later.  I had flashbacks very strongly for a long, long time.  In fact, I still do at night when we are on roads in a car or when I am typing at my computer, especially with music.  Whatever I took was beautiful, I am shrooming again this weekend.  I was blown away.  I highly suggest going insane for a night, it brought me into perspective.  I felt for a long time as if my life was simply building to that point and then I finally hit it, I finally was real.  Now I am whole.  It completed something in me that is unexplainable.  It made me realize that I had never matured past seven years old and at that point I went through every stage of maturing that there is.
