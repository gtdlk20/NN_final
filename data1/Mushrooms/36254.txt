However, whenever we stopped the car at a stoplight I felt confined and very nervous.  Apparently I was farther out than I thought becuase my roomy told me I was dead quiet in the car and then when he asked me how I was doing I said 'I'm having a moment with the sky, I can't explain man.'  I guess I was a little more connected than I thought.  It was a great drive up to the top of the hill where the dining hall was because we could look at all the mountains.
