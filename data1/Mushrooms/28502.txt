The next morning was nice, not too bright, maybe around 12 °C. I cleaned everything, saved myself, gathered wood and chopped enough to maintain a steady, good fire till the next morning. This took me till around 11. The depression I suffered two days earlier completely vanished and I felt good for another go, heated up some water, not to the boiling point and threw some 3.5 g Psilocybe cubensis in and tried avoiding boiling the water because I suspected excessive heat might destroy the psilocybin/psilocin. I failed in doing that and it may have slightly simmered for approximately one minute. After ten minutes I poured it through a sieve over an infusion bag of herbal tea.
