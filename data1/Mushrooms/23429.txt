It was summer. As a matter of fact, it was really late summer, only three days before my sophomore year started. My friend and I acquired the shrooms on a complete fluke. It was definitely unexpected, yet extremely surprising. The reason for this was because we have tried almost the whole summer to get some shrooms, but always ended up disappointed. From this point on, I will call my friend Trevor.
