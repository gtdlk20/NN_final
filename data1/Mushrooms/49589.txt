There were 3 of us in a average size room with plaid carpet and a Jimi Hendrix poster on the wall the kept moving and making sounds. then about 2 hours into it we began drinking the 2nd batch witch was by far blacker and purple that the other one, so we mixed the kool-aid and I drank the 1st 4 glasses out of it very quickly and then continued until I had reached a total of 15 8 oz. cups from this batch makin it a total of 21 cups. Then all hell broke loose, the visuals became very, very intense, and I couldn't close my eyes it felt as if they were being pulled open and at that point I couldn't remember my name I was trying to find out my true identity. That lasted about 20 minutes then I decided I needed to try and come back to earth.
