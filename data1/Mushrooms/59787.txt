Well, starting to get bored up in single room, I decided to move out to the back yard where everyone had been slowly trickling. I was a little scared, to move downstairs in view of some supervisors perhaps that I might be weaving or something, but I made it out back alright. The backyard I was in was small, but it had a lot of very pleasant looking plants and the main thing, a large trampoline that could fit probably seven people comfortably. It is very dark out back, but my eyes in utter dilation made it so I could just barely make things out, the ideal environment for visuals. Utterly confuses your brain, it doesn't know what anything is, so it makes everything look like something it's not, it's beautiful. My friend placed his hand on a magazine and told me to stare, it decomposed before my eyes.
