I listened to some music on my headphones while lying in bed...various things, among them Donovan (who I usually dislike) and drew for a little while, which was pretty fun. Later I just layed in bed while I watched thin multicolored lines of light race around the walls in a fashion reminiscent somehow of a pinball machine or video arcade.
