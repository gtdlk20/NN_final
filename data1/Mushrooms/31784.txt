I have tried mushrooms a few more times since then and each time it is the same. It starts off beautifully and gives me pretty much a full body orgasm and then my thoughts become deep and cyclical and I recognize the feeling of losing my mind. Then I black out. Sobriety slaps me in the face at the end of the night and its as if 3 hours of my life have been cut out of my memory. I assume its probably because I dont have much exposure to drugs. I try pot every once in a while and I try hallucinogens every once in a while. But I never really let myself get used to them. So each time its like a first trip, really powerful. With pot, it is easy to calm myself down, but on mushrooms I always black out when the cyclical thoughts hit me out of no where. I understand that I am just different from other users, and I have to be really careful. I am small so I cant handle too much of any substance.
