Next are the three highlights of my first day and shrooming experience at Bonnaroo. It may sound weird or even funny, but this next experience was simply amazing and itÂ’s something I would probably try again. I had a moment with a porta-pottie, a thirty minute moment. I simply went into a porta-pottie to take a quick piss and continue my walking tour, however, once I got inside, the textures on the inside of the stall sparked a very strong visual trip. I stood in the stall for thirty minutes, watching the walls make circular, wavelike motions. After a couple minutes of that, I started to see shapes appear. After approximately ten minutes of this, finally a girls face appeared in the wall. I spent the next twenty minutes having a conversation with this face.
