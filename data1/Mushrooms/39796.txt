I start cutting up the mushrooms (all 8 grams) into tiny bits with scissors.  Because I'm not a fan of the taste of shrooms, the way I like to ingest them is to cut them into little bits and swallow them (without chewing) with some orange juice.  Once I had the whole lot cut up, I measured out 3 piles; 2 piles weighing 3 grams each, and 1 pile weighing 2 grams.  The two gram pile I put away for another day.
