12:00 A.M. - Around this time we had devoured our entire bags and were laying on his bed when we decided to put our favorite movie in Alice in Wonderland. In our previous trips we had always watched this movie. We had experienced a full-out fantasy dream-like state when we had watched this movie during our previous trip, and we had believed that we had almost found the true meaning of life and why we existed as human beings. We basically wanted to try watching this movie again to see if we could understand it better, and maybe continue the trip from where we left off last time.
