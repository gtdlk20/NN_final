I vaguely thought that this was what death was like, trying desperately to hold on, but your body just oozes away, and everything constantly moves. I felt slightly sick, but it was incredible. I needed dry. I made my way out of the bathroom and collapsed on the hallway floor, a light on the ceiling was right above me. My hands constantly changed, from orange to purple, and they grew and shrunk. They would look 200 years old, and next second look like bloated baby hands, fresh to the world. Back in the living room, where we ended up again, bill and ben could be heard having meaningless conversations and trying not to completely lose it. I lay on my stomach on the floor, and tried to pull myself together. Even in my insanity, I knew that this was a drug that was passing through me, and I knew I would not lose it because all I had to do was go through it, and I would come out the other side sober and alive, with much to think about.
