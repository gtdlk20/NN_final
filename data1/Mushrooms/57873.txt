First, I walk by foot (this was about 70mins later). I was amazed by all silence at night, the appearance of trees, the beauty of flowers, the smells, the cat passing by. Only some rare appearances of cars annoyed me a little. People were also pretty strange to my mind. I was ok and happy. I decide to pick my bike. The cannals of water from the city were amazing! They seem vivid and alive with the water being pulled by the wind! The scenarios were almost divine by this time. Something otherwordly.  Life seemed a dream.
