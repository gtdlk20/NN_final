Around 7:30 I began eating the shrooms while watching the Simpsons. I can stand the taste of shrooms unlike most people. I don't know why, but in my opinion they go really well with Dr. Pepper. It took me approx. 30 min to consume the shrooms since I was constantly distracted by the Simpsons, I love that show!
