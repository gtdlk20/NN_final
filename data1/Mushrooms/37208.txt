Anyways, by the time I got back to the house I was already seeing huge detailed kaleidoscopes filling my vision that were much more lucid and flowing than the LSD visuals I was used to. I decided to put on Willy Wonka & the Chocoalte Factory because I wanted to see the infamous tunnel scene. The sober sitter decided to play around with the color dials on the TV, and somehow manipulated it so that all the people were bright red, and that made their eyes look ridiculously huge and demon like.
