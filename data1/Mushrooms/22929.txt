After a while, I got up in an effort to warm myself up by moving and to escape from the seductive call of my mattress. I was repeating to myself, 'You didn't ask for comfort, only enlightenment. Well here's your enlightenment. So fucking face it.' You see, the problems in my life were all coming to the forefront of my thoughts, but I was shutting down rather than thinking through any of them. When I stood up though, I decided to stop trying to force the trip into something it wasn't. Even if the mental acuity to work through my problems was there, the drive was not. It was simply too overwhelming to deal with. So I asked myself if I've ever let myself just be. Now I know that sounds like New-Age nonsense, but what followed was a very relaxing and rewarding experience. I pushed every thought out of my head and listened to what my body was telling me. Then I danced.
