While this idea was running though my head, I finally made it back to my dorm, and was thoroughly relieved to find my friends.  They were watching t.v. Completely oblivious to the madness I just lived through, and I couldnt decide if I wanted to cry in the most deepest depression of laugh in pure mania.  I started to try and relate my ideas to them through metaphors, but I continually failed to say anything coherent that they could understand, and the frustration of this was horrible.
