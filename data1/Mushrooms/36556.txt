The minute I stood up I began to notice a perception change.  A sort of luminesence fell over all of my surroundings.  I convinced R to watch 'Yellow Submarine' with me and several other 'trippers' (For those who have not done mushrooms previously, I would strongly recommend the movie).  As I watched the movie sitting in a recliner I began to notice that the room around me seemed to be convulsing as if it was breathing, the blue walls bending in and out as if something was trying to break through.  The movie, as interesting as it was, seemed far too long and tedious for me.  I left the room along with R who was regretting having consumed a Mountain Dew during the trip.  As we stepped out into the hallway adjacent to the TV room a new reality seemed to have descended upon us.  Everything seemed so real, so incredibly finite.  At this point R left and I began one of the most deep-thinking life-changing experiences of my life.
