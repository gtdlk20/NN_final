All in all, I learned that mushrooms, and life in general, can be enjoyed on two levels. There is the amusement park level. One may see pleasant and interesting visual hallucinations, laugh with his/her friends, and generally feel good. There is also the deeper, spiritual level. I can engage in philosophical conversations, meditate on my life, and have life-altering experiences. Though neither level is exclusive from the other (I experienced both during my trip) it is important to recognize the different ways in which this wonderful ethnogen may be used.
