It was a chilly cloudy October evening in Cincinnati, and I had just gotten off work at my part time job at a deli in the Gaslight District.  I had been mentally preparing myself all day for how screwed up I was going to get that given evening on the bag of shrooms I had picked up a couple of days earlier from a trusted source.  My plans were to go to some friends house that had planned a Shroom party several days earlier when an abundance of the substance came to town.
