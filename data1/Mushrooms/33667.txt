Meanwhile P began to say that he was experiencing a bad trip but this was quickly remedied by a hearty round of singing start wearing purple by Gogol Bordello. We found our way back to the beach and began running around shirtless yelling obscenities and toilet humor. BUTTMINES!!!! We got back to the tent and P sat down with his guitar and began yelling Im a fuckin rockstar!
