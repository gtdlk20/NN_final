So I was staying home one day and had absoluley nothing to do.  My father was a floor below me, snoozing away, unaware of the journey I was about to partake.  The plan was to stay inside my room up stairs all morning long, listen to some music, write down some life theories, philosophies and revelations, and if I was lucky, see some cool shit.
