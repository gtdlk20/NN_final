4:40- when we got to the trail, it hit me hard. I could barley walk at all, I was very slow at it, but I had the rush to yell at a couple that I did not know as they walked by. My two other friends busted out the pipe and lit up a bowl. Im a heavy pot smoker,several times a day, everyday. However when the pipe was passed to me I refused..I actually wanted nothing to do with smoking pot at that moment, it was very strange, but I did not want to smoke. The effects were getting heavy. It was like a force wrapping itself around me, making me walk very slow. It took an hour to walk a distance that would normally take 5 minutes. The trees on the trail seemed to be trying to grab me, they were pointing at all directions, and looked almost like some kind of octopus trying to grab me.
