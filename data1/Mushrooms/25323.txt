T-2:00 to 3:00--Theres a town about 10 minutes walking from the hotel, and we decide to go there for no reason. Now we have started having a very deep discussion. We talk about everything. The main topic was HOW everything existed...we didn't touch on the WHY. We talked about how the mind worked, how we interacted with other people, why humans had drive to do what we did, why we wore clothes, how our brains are arranged, a lot of stuff. The whole time I'm noticing that my throat feels dusty and odd, and my mouth feels like its about a foot back from where it should be. My thoughts are endless and everything still looks very weird. We walk to town and then come back and sit down on a different bench.
