Anyways, I got there, and immediately noticed a difference. There was about the same amount of people, maybe a little more. The drumline was far better and less scattered making for more dense rifts, powerfully tugging at my euphoria, making me tingle and shiver with warmth. Here I saw 8 naked hippie chicks in there early 20's, doing the most amazing dances, Egyptian style it seemed with an erotic texture. I had this premonition that I would be here for the remainder of the night. People weren't coming and going in a frenzy-like motion, freaking out trying to sell their drugs and going in every direction like down in the main part. Everybody was settled in, and the cool part is that it was easy to find a place suitable for me because the rows were in order from the smallest and the ones sitting and lying down to the tallest ones standing up and dancing mildly.
