We played and laughed and sat and talked looking up at the clouds they were otherworldly and appeared very close like maybe only 50m above our heads. At some stage we started meandering back up the beach. I was so completely at peace sometimes we were silent and my wife commented, why arent you talking? and answer was that my strivings have ceased. All of the stuff that I deal with and think about had reached its completion. I am truly satisfied and completely at peace. I feel like I have been understood and that I can and do understand. All that needs to be expressed has been, and now there is...Existence...Being. Timeless, harmonious perfect life. This is what heaven must be like. This is a glimpse of what is to come. An appetizer.
