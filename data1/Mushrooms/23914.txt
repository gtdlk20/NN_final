There was one white house with a particularly bright porch light that drew us all toward it like moths.  We wanted to go knock on the door and meet the people who lived there because we 'knew' it was an important house, but once again our common sense barely caught up with us as I took my first step onto the porch.  We returned to the road.  We passed a house where a lady was outside putting things in her car, obviously getting ready to go to work early in the morning.  We were whispering to each other very conspicuously, and we were laughing hard at the fact that she probably knew we were on drugs.  I felt her slight fear of our mental instability when she glanced at us and returned to her business as we passed by.  When she was out of sight, we burst into intense laughter.
