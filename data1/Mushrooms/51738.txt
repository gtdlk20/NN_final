I knelt down by the toilet, which, in a place like that, would normally make me puke anyway, but then my head cleared.  I stood up, realized that the peak was over, and went back to where I was sitting.  I no longer needed to take a walk outside or anything -- I couldn't talk much, but I could stare at people, which is half the point at this place anyway.  My point is, I usually don't notice a peak on shrooms.
