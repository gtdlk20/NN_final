On a sunny afternoon in southern England we decided the time was right and consumed 2g of shrooms blended with orange juice. I was extremely nervous and the taste didnt exactly build me with confidence so I drank them quite slowly, hoping I would get used to the taste. We then sat outside in my garden and waited.
