We all went to a friends house up the street whose parents were gone for the evening so we would have a safe place to partake in our organic goodies. There was an ounce of Cubensis between 8 people, and the house-owner and her boyfriend as sober sitters since we had some first time hallucinogen users dropping as well. I made mine in a single glass of tea, chopped into semi-large chunks and brought to a near-boil twice. The mushrooms were then filtered out with a spaghetti strainer, and with the shrapnel I made a piece of garlic toast, the only food I would eat in the entire night.
