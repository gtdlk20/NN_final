The night before, they called me up asking if I wanted to but an extra 2 grams for 10 more dollars, and I agreed. So the next night, around 7, the 3 people came over, all girls, leaving me the only guy, and they handed me the shrooms. I studied them for a few minutes. They were broken up and in some sort of dust, which they told me was just shroom pieces they were grated. One of the girls took me to the kitchen, where she divided the shrooms in 2 piles, one pile was 1.5 grams, the other was 2 grams. She said that I would take 1.5 grams now, and if it didn't start working in an hour, iIwould take the rest. I didn't argue with that.
