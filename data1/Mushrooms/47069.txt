I felt so good, I was totally peaked on the first dose and I was about an hour into the 2nd dose and I was having the time of my life, I would have cried but I was too focused on keeping the drum rift perfect. Then the trip got really intense and I felt bored with the drum so I gave it back to the guy and decided to stand up. I had been sitting there for a while anyways, I needed to stretch a little. So I started to stand up and it was a strange fucking experience just simply standing up from the sitting position. I felt like I had to be extremely careful so I got up really slow and I felt like I was growing out of the ground slowly, or more like I was hatching out of an egg, experiencing motor skills for the first time. It was almost like being physically reborn, reborn into this miraculously heavenly void.
