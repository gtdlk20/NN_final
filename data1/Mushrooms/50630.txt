I had to move to the kitchen where the music wasn't as loud. There, I stared at the broom which had a very dark, sadistic quality about it... It made me nervous... and one of the guys who wasn't shrooming, decided to mess with me and dangled a measuring tape in front of my face while I stared at it, confused. I could not figure out what it was! Once I did realize, I collapsed onto the floor in a fit of laughter. I never felt so out of control... It was as if I was watching myself act in this bizarre manner and I couldn't do anything about it. My boyfriend shortly discovered the evil broom as well and stared at it with wary eyes. My friend who was teasing me with the measuring tape, decided to mess with my boyfriend by picking up the broom and chasing him into the bedroom. Once again, I broke down into helpless laughter.
