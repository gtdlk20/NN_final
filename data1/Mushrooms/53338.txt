7:44 Music is wonderful.. the energy is a pleasant if a little demanding. The urge to let the mind wander into all sorts of interesting places tends to be very strong but the urge to write everythng down so I can look at it while I am striaght. Also overwhelms I am aware of all the viens in my hands and the speed with which I am tyyping is terribly intersting... the veins are really wierd... But the music and everything is the GREATEST... plus the tenetion in my arms from the awkard way I am writing.
