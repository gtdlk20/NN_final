It was Spring break 2003.  Three of my friends and I went to Florida, and we decided to go spend a day in Key West.  We had an afternoon to spend just hanging around the beautiful, beautiful island.  I was super-mellow, and did not have a care in the world.  I had brought some mushrooms down there to eat, and I was excited about that.
