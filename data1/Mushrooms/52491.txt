I finally started grasping a fraction of what normal reality was and started talking myself down. My friend wasn't having this luck so i helped talk him down too. I told him to vomit because he was talking about going to the fucking hospital and those damn demons, aliens or whatever. Then it struck me i was tripping! Thru all of the previous drama we had both forgot we were tripping! We went so far out that we forgot how to come back. I started laughing and running around his house declaring 'WE ARE ONLY TRIPPING!' I repeated this like a mantra to help lift our spirits into a positive space. It worked my friend got up and we both agreed that we went out of our heads. Coming down was slow but more relaxed. We both learned something about life and reality that day even though some of it was very confusing and still complex to this day.
