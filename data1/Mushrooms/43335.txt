By now I was an hour into my trip. I was getting increasingly complex visuals. Every line in my peripheral seemed to curve off into a fractal. I began to think about fractals in math and how theyÂ’re found in nature. I thought that mushrooms made my brain think in fractals: pure math. Ideas in my head would spiral. I would get an idea or emotion and it would spiral into the extreme. I had too many to recall specifically.
