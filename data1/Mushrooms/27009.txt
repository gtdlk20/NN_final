I sat down in front of my little shrine area, meditation spot, whatever the hell you want to call it, with my mushrooms and a glass of water. It is, I feel, a good place for what I was trying to do, its tranquil, familiar and pretty cozy. I meditated for about 20 minutes and then I ate the mushrooms raw. Tasted like shit. It only took about 15 minutes, tops, to kick in, I hadnt eaten anything that day. I didnt keep any kind of timeline or anything so the time span is pretty fuzzy.
