The whole night we only rode a few roller coasters. We spent most of the night just walking around talking about our lives and our friends. It seemed like the two of us had a connection and could just talk about anything, but we could barely talk to our other friend who wasn't tripping. It seemed like she was the unusual one and like she wasn't making any sense.
