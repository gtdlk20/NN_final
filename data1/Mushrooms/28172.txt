The reason for the title is that I'm not sure what I did was what is accepted as ego loss. I didn't experience any feelings of 'being torn apart' or anything of the like, there was no physical manifestation that I was aware of, but in retrospect I was completely out of touch with physical reality at the time. I don't think I experienced 'ego loss' so much as conscious disassociation, especially the specific part where after choosing what I felt was good practice I reflected on a wholly disassociated level and came to realisation that a lot of what I thought was good practice, really wasn't or should be changed. It was sort of like, I was a different person while peaking so when reflecting upon myself I was able to arbitrate decisions. It wasn't ego loss so much as a temporary beneficial change of ego. I've never meditated, but it felt akin to the ultimate goal of introspective meditation.
