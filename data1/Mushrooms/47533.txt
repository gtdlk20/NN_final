G became a puddle on the ground and he said I became a distorted hourglass figure with no torso. The woods began to really scare me as they were getting increasingly dark. I tried to get G to leave with me but he wouldnÂ’t so I decided that life is really a personal adventure and it would be ok to leave. I ran as fast as I could out through the pricker bushes and trees to escape those woods. Branches seemed to pass through my body. I walked to my car started it pulled out a little then said No Way. I pulled back in and walked to the gas station.
