Out of the 4 of us who ate 'shrooms, one guy didn't feel anything, another guy had a really mild trip, and the other person (who ate about twice as much as any of us) had a decent trip.  I can't say whether or not I'll try them again. I do really believe mushrooms are a great way open up your mind, but maybe I'm just not meant for them =P
