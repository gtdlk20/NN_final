When in my cousin's car, we put on the system, with Bob Marley, and it was one of the greatest feelings I've ever had.  It was like a blanket, and I was being kept warm and safe by it.  I tried to keep from dwelling on something for too long, because it told me that if I didn't keep flowing I would become stagnant??!.  So I kept going into trances and then returning, only to go down another path.
