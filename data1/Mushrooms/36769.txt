The trip went incredibly well. At 11:40, when everyone was asleep in the house, we each took the first gram. We took the two other grams about 15 minutes later. Since we had not eaten for about 8 hours, the effects came on very quickly. At midnight I was feeling very obvious effects, and they became stronger and stronger with every passing minute.
