Then suddenly a voice in my head, which I presume to be the entity talking to me without physically talking in perceivable words. The voice said ok, you've seen too much, and from now on you cannot seek, you must be shown. Again this voice was comforting and with that, the being vanished and I was all of a sudden back in my bedroom. But it wasn't over, I was now seeing out of my mouth and my body didn't exist, it was just sight, breathing and thoughts. And they all seemed to come from one specific area around my mouth. I was no longer human, I was energy and knowledge and nothing else. I meditated like this for quite sometime. Then suddenly I got a phone call from my girlfriend. I remember thinking how strange it was that I had a phone. I thought as if all humans were dumb to be using cell phones when forms of communication didn't even need words where I had just been. It was strange being thrust back into my human reality, it was nice to have a break but I suddenly hated the fact that I was human stuck in a society that pushes information onto you and discourages free thinking and true spirituality. I felt as if my mind had been absolutely blown away.
