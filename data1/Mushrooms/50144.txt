I was having a lot of fun now, and I spent the rest of the evening chilling with my mates lying in the field explaining to them what I was experiencing. At around 8:30 I went home. My sister was back and she enquired what Id been doing all and I told her that Id had a few friends round and Id got slightly drunk. She (and my entire family) strongly disapprove of drugs, so I omitted that part of my day from the story!
