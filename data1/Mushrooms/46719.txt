We were both having difficulty walking now, much like a diphenhydramine trip, we felt quite heavy, the dizziness from rides was affecting us for longer than C and P. We both felt like we wanted a line of coke and M mentioned it would be good if we had some MDMA on us. We decided that it was time for the ghost train, a crazy idea, but we were both up for it. The ghost train there is like a game, the four of us got into a train and you get a gun each to shoot at targets. Its not a particularly scary ride, but M jumped a few times. On leaving he declared that Some bits had scared me, but I thought he said some bitched had scared me I could not see the bitch, but I believed what he had said. By now we were both on a peak of the high, talking complete trippy bollocks to one another and keeping C and P entertained.
