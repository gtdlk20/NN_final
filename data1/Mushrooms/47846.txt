At T+ 2h 15 min we got back to the house.  I still had significant visuals and mental effects for another hour and a half, and then the mushrooms gradually tapered off.  The burnout wasn't bad - just a mild headache and the feeling I'd just been crushed by weight of experience.  I had somewhat of an afterglow the next day, things looked slightly strange or different than normal.
