James and I feared that there was a dead body wrapped inside, but we had had enough of playing with the mysterious object and decided to leave it alone. We opened a bottle of wine and relaxed ourselves, talking away the rest of the trip and gazing at the HUGE sky above us - the only bit of light we saw that night save for the lighthouse.
