Once in the car I started to have these cyclical thoughts. I started to have these cyclical thoughts. The body high of pleasure was finally turning into numbness. The thoughts I was having were all I could concentrate on. I was getting these weird understandings of the way the Universe operated. It seemed like life was a never ending cycle with no point to it whatsoever. Eventually I started to forget who I was and where I was from. I felt like I might just be God, trying to distract myself from my loneliness by creating this pattern of life and death on Earth, something I could trap my mind in forever so that I wouldnÂ’t have to bear with the cold, hard truth: that I was alone and always would be, for all eternity. Time and space were just invented by me to make my miserable existence more bearable.
