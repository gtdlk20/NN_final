I decide very quickly and without warning to get on my bike and abandon the trippers without saying goodbye.  I ride off very quickly until I am at an arbitrary spot with no notion of how far I've come other than that it is probably more than a mile.  I try to read a street sign, it isn't telling me anything. I lock my bike to a pole so I can walk around.
