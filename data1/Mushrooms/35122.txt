Then the shapes and colors began to form and took the shape of a sphere. Have you ever seen an active graphic equilizer? The lines that move at different wavelengths and stuff? Well I could see all the wavelengths that my fan was producing. The lines were coming out of the center of the sphere and reached to the edges of the sphere so I wanted to see what was at the center. Ever look at a t.v. up close? You see the pixals that make up the big picture. That is exactly was I saw. The pixaltion of sound.
