Saturday night and I prepare.  Backpack ready with bottle of water, smokes, CDs and a few books...and a few grams of good herb.  I grind the shrooms up very fine, adding them to a tea blend which I think was Lemon Zinger. Saving a few caps for during my trip, I proceed to drink my tea.  The first sign of mushroom tripping for me is a deathly feeling.  I lay on the bed, half convulsing and shaking, feeling really sick and wishing I hadn't eaten the shrooms when all of a sudden, 'Peace, Harmony, Silence, Noise, Alive and well.' Sick feeling is gone. God-like feeling has taken over.
