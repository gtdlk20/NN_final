Oh yeah, dancing feels good alright, despite Scatmans ramblings I can suddenly keep up with his (j)ibberish and pump feet into the ground at the same rhythm. I check my gauge; the lamps are all still shining plain. I turn back to the stubborn portrait. Just you wait lady, we are going on a trip. She doesnt look impressed, but her baby is still paying attention. So I throw on some faster techno to see if I can make her smile.
