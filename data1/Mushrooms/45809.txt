I noticed my closet door was warping and swelling intensely, and I swore it was trying to open.  I thought to myself and the mushroom, I am ready to learn what you have to teach me. And then the trip really gripped me!  The door seemed almost to melt to the floor, and I felt a voice more than heard it say Are you sure?  So I thought back to it, Well, how about you just show me what you think I can handle?  And it almost felt like a person I loved was smiling at me, nodding their head in understanding.  What happened at that point was a gift.  The mushroom gave me even more intense CEVs, while gently lulling me into an almost sleepy trance.  If I opened my eyes, I had the usual trip effects  trails, swelling walls, fantastic and sudden understandings of existence and life and the soul.  But when I closed my eyes, it was a whole different world. If what I saw behind my eyes got too intense, I was able to just open my eyes and be back in this realm.
