So he leaves for work, his girlfriend leaves, and the roommates leave to go get beer and other errands.  I sit alone eat the mushrooms and decide to watch FINDING NEMO because I wanted to know how a family related concept mixed with a life in the ocean was like.  So finding nemo starts and so does the trip.  Everything was all cute and cudly until the barracuda in the beginning when the wife and children get eaten.  At that point everything turned to shit I no longer wished to be a fish in the ocean.  The sharks and the clear and present danger of being a fish in the ocean had made me very ill and I decided to distract myself from this terrible lifestyle of a fish in the ocean.  So I reached onto the floor with my one hand and turned it into a strange little animal for him to walk strangly but spider-like on the floor.  The carpet was shaggy so it made for cool open field effect.  Then as my little hand creature was walking around some damn thing just popped into my head the concept; heaven and hell.
