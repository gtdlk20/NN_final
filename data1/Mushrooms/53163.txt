I could go on forever. It is, however, such an impossible task to describe all the visions and sensations, that I won't even try. The trip was totally different from what I had expected, but then again, certain parts of it greatly exceeded my wildest hopes. Despite the fact that I had stomach aches throughout the following morning, I was more than satisfied with the mushies + felt energetic and happy. I still keep on bursting to laughter all of a sudden. Strangely enough, none of the other trippers had experienced anything so earth-moving. Do I recommend this for others? Hell, yes! Nothing will ever be quite the same again...
