After a while of smoking weed and weird creeping up vibes (this is only 15 -20 minutes after I took the hit) we left the back of Vons and shut the gate behind us and my tweaker 'friend' dips out on me and says he has to leave like he always does so we head in opposite directions and I head up towards my neighborhoods in the more suburban part of town still having the feeling in my mind that this 'acid' wasn't real acid. I mean it was only $10 a hit so how could it be? I've bought 15 -$20 hits in the past that were complete crap. So why would this stuff be different?
