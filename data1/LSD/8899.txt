10:30-11:00 PM. I still didnt feel anything pronounced. I was reading that LSD could take up to an hour and a half to react, so I grew more patient. I started to read peoples reports, some of which were negative, which was probably a bad idea given the circumstances. I began thinking to myself Well, there is no way back now. I must ride this wave back to the shore. I printed off a pornographic image to see how LSD effected ones perceptions of sex and sexuality. After attempting to jack off, I realized how uninteresting the image was, as well as the premise of sex itself. Pornography had always repulsed me unless I was aroused prior to looking at it. I was becoming a bit drowsy. Hmmm, I thought I should probably leave. I dont want to wake my parents up if I start making odd noises or knocking things about.
