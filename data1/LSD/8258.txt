T+4.10- The friend whose flat I was at turned to me and grabbed my face and said Listen to me, the worlds about to end. But it has to happen several times. Do you understand? I said What? Ok. Ok.  What do I have to do? Just ride it out. It has to happen. Its going to be hard, but it needs to happen sooner or later, and it happens to be now. I then start screaming to my friends Its all me! Its all me! over and over again and laughing hysterically. They say Yeah man. Its in your head. Its all you. I then run out of the flat, and have another episode of brain spasms and palpitations. Then I pull myself off the floor and the sky above me is on fire. I dont see a moon. I dont see any stars. Just fire, everywhere, that spreads down the houses and onto the streets and I can see in the distance a wall of flames getting closer and closer. Then for some reason I start screaming and shouting, a nonsensical jumble of random swear words and cries. I turn back and run to my friends door, ringing the bell over and over. He answers, and I run inside to his bedroom. Then his girlfriend grabs me and says OK, just stay calm. Youre doing well. Just keep going. I then leave the flat again and S and T follow behind. I then see myself, S, and T walking down the street from an external viewpoint. When we reach the corner at the end of the road, a man throws me to the floor and shoots me in the head. Then I realise Im walking down the street about to come to the corner.  I turn to my friends and shout Listen to me. Im about to die. Theres nothing we can do but, Im about to die ok? They responded with Shut up man, no-ones gonna die and things like that. I then ran back to the flat again and was ringing the bell a hundred times and my friends mother answered the door and I grabbed her face shouting Im going to die. I have to go. Help me, Im going to die. She then grabbed my face and said You have to do it again. Go back outside.
