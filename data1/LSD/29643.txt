I had been sipping tea prepared with roughly fifty micrograms of LSD for about an hour [had taken 25 micrograms, approximately], while doing organic chemistry homework; and once I was alone in the classroom, I turned on some music. The music was played from a single speaker, located inside a desktop computer about half a meter from my head, on my right side. I've been slightly congested in the recent weeks, due to the onset of winter, but could currently hear the music clearly from both ears.
