I started taking LSD on 1999 and I used to consume it in blotter form every weekend (found that LSD tolerance was almost 7 days on my organism) till 2000. That was a whole year of LSD consumption almost every weekend. I started with doses of 1 blotter and after that year and a half my latest doses were about 5-6 blotters. I can say I never had a bad trip, and I decided to quit acid when the nasty after effects no longer had a positive relationship with the good effects.
