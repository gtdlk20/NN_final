Within a half-hour of telling my brother about it, my brother had it in his mouth. The next day he gave it his stamp of approval. What was left of the strip of paper was a little less than an inch and a half. My brother took about a half-inch square. He recommended that I cut up what was left of the paper into five pieces and then take one piece. I told John to cut up what was left into thirds because a fifth didn't seem like enough to me.
