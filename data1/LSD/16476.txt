As I waited and watched the throngs of customers, I realized something about my sight.  I remembered seeing like this before, or at least thought I did.  I felt, and of course will never be able to confirm, that I had been given the eyes of my childhood back, seeing everything clearly and with wonder.  But I was more perceptive of the people.  I saw sadness in people that broke my heart.  One woman in particular, gaunt and pale, and the man she was with just had the look of a complete jerk.
