I started walking and felt the rising vibes of it and began texting my friend Luke who was tripping on an eigth of cubensis mushrooms that day. This whole time we texted eachother and kept eachother updated on our trips. I began walking and saw a nice place to meditate near the river. I walked down and saw a rock and pulled out my Daodejing and began reading. As I began reading I didnt like the Daodejing as much as I had the past few days I had begun reading it. It made me feel blank, like I was just another spec on a spiderweb. I kept reading hoping I would feel more blissful but this blank feeling just exacerbated the further I read. So I put it away and lit a cigarette. I sat watching the water sparkle and run over rocks puffing on my cigarette. When I was finished I got up and began walking again. I felt blank, almost like an ego death. This was a small dose but for the next hour or so I felt I had experienced an ego death. I wasnt feeling any emotions and I wasnt percieiving anything other than how it was. I didnt like this, most people would like this feeling saying this is how we should percieve the world. I beleive however, that everything has a spirit and is symbolic of many different things.
