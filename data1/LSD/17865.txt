At some point, while Summer and I were laying on the carpet together again, I told Summer of this and she began clinging to me again begging me not to go out there with a lil bit of panic in her voice. (She later said she thought I meant like outside the condo, which I can understand.) Though even if she had known at the time that I only meant the living room, just the dark and shadows would have probably been a big no-no for her.
