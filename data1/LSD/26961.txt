Eventually, J. and B. both left, leaving K., C. and me to continue our journey together.  We alternated between the front yard (definitely a dark night, with the street lights adding an eerie glow to everything) and the living room with Pink Floyd and a lava lamp.  No matter what we were looking at, we all saw the same thing:  the street oozing, the ceiling sliding, the carpet flowing, trees melting--WOW!!!  I had never seen anything more beautiful in my life.  The shared experience was the closest I have ever come to feeling at one with my surroundings.  The life around us just flowed and pulsated and caressed me in a way that I can never hope to describe.  C. was just in heaven, and we were so happy for him.  The sunrise was a truly cosmic experience.  None of us felt any ill effects, save the drained feeling that comes at every trip's end.  Furthermore, the three of us connected on a level which can never be expressed in words.  We just look at each other, remember, and understand.  Damn, what a feeling.
