Im interrupted by Slim saying something about the sun winking at him. I stare at him for a second, and begin laughing hysterically. We both fall on the floor laughing and talking about what we saw during the sun's appearance, acting like a couple jocks winning the championship. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen in my life. I was in love with LSD. I have since tripped maybe 500 times, I have never had a bad trip. I have never felt better in my life.
