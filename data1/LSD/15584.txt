The day started with a road trip to see the Rolling Stones.  Personally I can't imagine a better way to start a day!  During a stop for road works at around 6.00pm I decided to drop.  The trip commenced after around 20 minutes - the usual stuff, feelings of anticipation, finding amusement in the most mundane things and slight perceptual disturbances.  Nothing untoward really.  The group I was with decided that they would each take half a trip and hold off until around 8.30.  Perhaps that would have been a wiser choice.
