All in all I have to say that it was a good experience.   I would never do it again purely because standing around doing nothing is boring and being on acid makes it even more intensely boring.  This is definitely the hardest I have ever tripped in my life and it has possibly changed a few things about my thinking.  I don't think I would really recommend this trip for anyone, as if I would've freaked out at all I think I would have gone insane.  We really weren't expecting the acid to be any good so we really just dosed to fast, so if you think you could pull it off go for it, but be careful.  Give your acid plenty of time to kick in.
