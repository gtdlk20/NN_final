Slowly the terrifying presence seemed to take less of a hold on us, and actually became a little humorous. We decided to blast some Jimi Hendrix out my window. His righteous wailings on the guitar would surely scare the evil force that was residing on my front lawn. And it did. The intensity subsided quite a bit after this. But I don't exactly know when Kid A and I stopped tripping. We definitely had residual effects for the rest of the summer. Thinking back on it, I believe that I had tripped my way into an oblivious transcendent state. I felt enlightened, and appreciative of my life and my surroundings. What ensued after our crazy summer was perhaps the most productive and happy times of my life. I truly felt that life was beautiful, and every moment was to be treasured.  I was truly aware and happy.
