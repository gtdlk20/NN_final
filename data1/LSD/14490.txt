The instant I opened the swinging kitchen door and saw the mess of screaming children and the personified rodent robots playing goofy songs about pizza and games I couldnt control my laughter. It was such an embarrassing laugh that I had to immediately run back in the kitchen so nobody else would hear. When I came back into the kitchen however, the laughter immediately stopped. It seemed I had entered a different place completely. There was a mixed tape of 90s hip-hop and great dance hits from the past decade blaring from the speakers in every corner of the kitchen. It looked like twice as many people in the kitchen then there really were, and Im sure the music was nowhere near as loud as I remember it. But it no longer looked like the standard kitchen scene at Chuck E. Cheeses, but rather a giant house party. Everyone was dancing around and singing, having the time of their lives.
