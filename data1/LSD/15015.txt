I hadn't had a good strong trip with lsd in many years, due to the consistently poor quality and low dosage of what was available to me. I recently moved back to the Seattle area from Portland, where, during my last few weeks it seemed there a was a large amount of synchronicity leading up to this experience, as I've always found the case when coming close to an intense encounter with psychedelics.
