Somewhere at that time I was completely sure that I was dead, I was observing N. having the best time in his life as S. asked me - is this okay? I told her that N. is god now. Then I told all them that I almost could not see them because I was seeing only fractals and eternity. There was no understanding of time, who I was, what was my name and if I was doing something in my life. I understood that there was no point in any fear, even of death, because even if I die, I will be reborn and I will meet exactly these souls in their mortal shells, and we will get whacked as usual. And this already happened countless times. This was the moment I realised that at 330ug we really need sitters, but there was no fear. Fear was pointless.
