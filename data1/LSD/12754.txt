We weren't sure if we could get tickets, and didn't want to take the acid until we were sure we got seats, so we didn't take it until about half an hour into the concert.  20 minutes after we took it, it was intermission and I had a sinking feeling that we wouldn't come up until after the concert.  However, I did start having some intense visuals a few minutes into the second half of the show, and everything started being abnormally funny.  I felt like the musicians were all talking to each other with their instruments.  I could understand what the musicians were saying, but knew that it couldn't be put into words.  When one of the guest musicians started scatting, it got especially intense and confusing because he was using his voice without actually saying words and so it seemed like he was communicating with the instruments with his voice in a way that I realized no one else could understand except me and Delyriem because we were the only ones with the 'full experience' I thought.  I felt incredibly happy, everything was so silly.  As soon as the concert was over we stood up and realized we needed to get out of the auditorium immediately because I was in no state to run into people I knew and have to talk. I was just tripping madly.
