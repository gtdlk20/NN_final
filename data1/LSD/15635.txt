I noticed while approaching the abandoned house, it seemed to stretch very far away then normal, and kept stretching the more I walked towards it. Half an hour since dropping, back with my friends now, all feeling the same anxious butterflies in us, I slowly begin to feel the effects. My mind starts racing, I feel energy building up in me, my stomach begins to tense up and also my jaw clenches in a strange matter, very different to MDMA. My friends heads are warping slightly, nothing drastic. I don't remember the full effects creeping up on me so quickly, but around 1 hour into the trip, after lying down for a bit I open my eyes, the trees around me are no longer trees, but a collage of of amazing colours collapsing into each other. The effects are quite intense, I feel a discomfort of some sort, nasuea? I couldn't tell, my body had left reality, and now for some reason I could not identify what nausea felt like. I take deep breaths, I look up. Now wait a minute, I've never seen a tree turn that colour before. I start to feel more comfortable, calming my self down, taking more deep breaths. 'Ok I've taken some acid. I WILL be ok. I've done it before, even if something bad happens I will still be ok.'
