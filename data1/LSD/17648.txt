About ten years ago I bought my third trip from a guy in my home town Norwich (UK) It was a 'Strawberry' and I was told it had been double dipped. The guy had a reputation for selling good acid so I happily gave him my cash . My being in Norwich was just a social visit over a couple of days and catching up with friends. On the last day there I decided to drop the tab and use my friends house as 'Trip HQ' He knew what I was up to, he had gone to work and left me his keys to make myself at home.  I began to come up on the acid towards the lunch time. It was to be the first and last time I'd ever trip alone . Outside it was a glorious sunny day but I was happy enough in my temporary sanctuary to even think about going outside. The LSD rush started blazing up my spine and racing through my guts, I felt a little uneasy with it but had enough mind to allow myself to just go with it and wait until the rush plateaued. It did just that a little later , I'd decided to sit in the upstairs of the house and listen to music on the radio in a sunlit bedroom . I was having a wonderful time , watching floral Escher type patterns breathing over my skin , I enjoyed looking in the mirror looking at my grinning face with very distinct map contour patterns gently washing over my flesh . Its seemed like a great start eh ?
