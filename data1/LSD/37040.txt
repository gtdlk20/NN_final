The fourth time I experimented with LSD, it was a perfect day on Miami Universities Western campus.  Everyone in our expanded group of friends was tripping.  The happiest day of my life.  Several hours into the trip, while walking down the hallway of my dorm, I began feeling intense energy currents swelling up from the earth.  Walking, dancing, moving with this energy towards my room, I began to wonder if I could do something with this energy, like using the force (star wars).  When I got to my room and sat down on my bed I felt the energy rise up through my body and exit my head (third eye?)  As this occurred my friend Brian was launched several feet backwards, stumbling.  He looks directly at me in sheer amazement, 'Was that you?'  Yes, it was. Part me, part mystery.  My life has since been not the same.  It was a climax of sorts, as I had been moving in the direction of metaphysics and latent abilities of the mind for years.  The question that followed was, why this particular experience happened to me?  What does this mean?  The short answer: reality is way more than most people realize.  But researching psychedelic experiences I have yet to find another story that talks about people using energy to manipulate the physical.
