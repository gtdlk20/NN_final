We are about 15 miles away from our exit and the end of this terrible toll road.  This road makes you stop and get tickets then stop and pay money.  It confuses me and angers me as I've never been on a toll road before.  Since the driving portion is almost over me and C drop our acid.  He takes 2 and I take one because I'm driving.  S has no acid to take because he thought it would be a bad idea and took his the night before.
