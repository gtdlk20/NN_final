I remember I was afraid that they were against me for some reason and I was afraid to say anything for fear that it might be true.I must have been quiet for an hour into the trip before I got the nerve to pull one of my best friends to another room and make sure that I wasnt insane.I had been trapped in my own fear and insecurities for a long time.What felt like an eternity.I was relieved to find that I was not the only person that was experiencing this.I went outside on the porch to breath the fresh air and get a grip on myself.Soon as I got out there I snapped out of it.I Went back in to discover that my cousin was running around the house swithing the lights on and off saying, Im Jeremy Im going to bed.This would of been fine if he had of stopped.He was stuck in a loop.Thats all he could do, he said the same things over and over again, and could not sit down, as if he could not figure out what he should be doing.LSD unlocks you from the dreadful repititions of boring habitual tendencies,that seem to consume our lives.He wasnt ready.Finally he was convinced to take an enormous bong hit and that did the trick. He snapped right out of it.We all had a giant learning experience that night.First, know what your taking,how strong it is and there is no need for taking more than is necessary.Two, plan out your trips.LSD is not for shits and giggles.
