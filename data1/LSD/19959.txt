So I lay down and for what I recall to be about forty minutes with my eyes closed were a tree, a human, and the planet.  First the tree grew out of the muddy ground, decayed, then fell the the earth.  This cycled repeatingly over and over again until the human appeared.  The human rose out of the muddy ground, decayed and fell back in.  This repeated for who knows how long until the planet happened.  The planet was going around the sun, zooming in quickly to make the continents visible the continents swirled all over the planet running into each other still zooming in to watch a mountain form.  Then rain clouds formed over the mountain falling as rain melting the mountain back into the ground.  This repeated itself for who knows how long.  Thinking maybe nap time was over I went outside.
