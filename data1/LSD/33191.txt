	At last, a baggy filled with 10 Sweetarts that set me back 150 big ones. Oh well, I was excited. Before I go into each trip/experience I always give myself a few minutes to reflect on what the upcoming event could hold in store for me, and try to induce mental clarity. At around 10:30pm I ingested the first piece of candy along with 4 other friends. Slightly metallic taste, hoping it was stronger than its taste had suggested. I still felt confident.
