We were now walking through a swamp that was about 1 foot deep.  I felt like I was sinking in quick sand.  When we got out of the swampy area I reached down to feel my pants, only to find that they were completely dry!  Not even any mud.  :) Hehe.  Phew, almost home free, then CRAP!  We have reached a freakin' dead end.  A wire fence all the way areound us.  But this was never here before???  AAAAAHHHHH.....I think everyone was a little freaked out about this.  It was a very trapped feeling, almost clausterphobic.  I remember hearing screams from a child near by and parents yelling.  I started running.  We found the end of the fence, and called a cab.  How did my boyfriend call a cab???  How could he possibly even speak?  This made me think he was coming down, and I didn't like the feeling of having to finish my peak alone.  Waiting for the cab on the curb for what seemed like a whole night, listening to my boyfriend talk about normal real things like the economy, and buying a house someday.  I just could not comprehend this.  Here comes five pairs of headlights!
