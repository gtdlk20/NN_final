Finally we are loading onto the ride.  The first hit of acid has gotten much stronger in the last ten minutes and as C begins to sit where I can't see him I protest and make him switch seats so that I'm sitting next to people I know.  We all take our shoes off and wait to be shot upward hundreds of feet.  It happens.  Going straight up that fast really confused me and I felt a huge adrenaline rush go through my body.  This felt different than anything I've ever done, but it filled me with happiness and energy and I ran from the ride sliding down the railing wanting to go ride more rides.  S was not tripping acid though and wanted to go to the beach to smoke one of the blunts that we rolled.  I couldn't argue that.
