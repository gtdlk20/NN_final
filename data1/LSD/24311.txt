When I got home I was much relieved to find that my mom only was a little bit mad that I missed Saturday evening church. The weird part was that she gave me a chocolate chip cookie that she baked that day. Holy Crap, I felt so good to know that I got away with going insane for the 5 hours. I was home and everything was going to be okay.
