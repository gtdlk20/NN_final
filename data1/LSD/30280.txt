The whole expirince was nice, everything was intence, more vivid, more alive. But it's not what I thought it would be. I heard people looking at walls and seeing red dragons and blue fairys- didnt see anything like that. No odd colors, just few weird movements, vivid taste, vivid sex and a lot of laughs.
