I had experimented a few times with acid and had only mild visuals that lasted for a couple of hours. I remember the first one which was a blotter and had a picture of a key with wings on it. I had a couple of other different ones with little effect and pretty much thought that I was a seasoned tripper who could take any tab of acid and be alright. Thats until I had my 6th trip.
