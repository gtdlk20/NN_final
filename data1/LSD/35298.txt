Once we had returned to my friends house I began to trip pictures and people in the room swirling in mad patterns this was amazing.   For me, LSD the affects can last for hours and eventually after destroying pumpkins, laying against a wall, eating mass amounts of sweets and pulling endless toots the acid began to get very boring and eventually I wish it away.
