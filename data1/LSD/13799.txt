I asked earth mother Sue if she felt this too,  she said yes,  and immediately we were bonded, each sentence she spoke seemed to hold great wisdom, great insight, in all my life I had never heard such profundity. She told me I was already high and was seeking to be grounded, that was my spirit quest, she however was too much grounded and wanted to get high, always higher, this was her frustration and spirit quest. Looking back she may have been talking complete crap but to me it was the ultimate insightful wisdom.
