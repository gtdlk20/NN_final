Sooner or later my cat comes to my room meowing like crazy which she doesnt usually do at this time and she just comes in and goes under my covers and just sits on my chest and starts purring. I start petting her and her purring feels very vibrational and alien. I remember the feeling of having a furry sentient animal on my chest being affectionate and trusting towards me was so strange, especially since everything still felt fairly primal. I remember I closed my eyes and it completely felt like I had this small strange alien life form vibrating on my chest almost felt connected to my chest and thought wtf this is so ridiculous. With my eyes closed I felt like she was this red alien life form with some kind of symbiotic relationship to me and MY alieness both biologically and emotionally. Because I was an alien too or some kind of hybrid. At least when Im in these higher dimensional tryptamine realms I am. Yeah cant explain the tryptamines at all theyre too different and explorative even when compared to other psychedelic drugs. Very emotional and soulful too. I just remember the words 'alien life form kept coming to my mind as this strange animal thing vibrated on my chest.
