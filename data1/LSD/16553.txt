The display was intriguing. The spiralling light sources left trails that appeared several feet long. Being an avid raver, and having never seen glowsticks present such charisma, I was left speechless. All I could do was stand and stare. The lights seemed to carry a certain emotional connotation that changed with the shades. This is a difficult feeling to relate but basically, I was 'feeling' colors. Yellow elevated my apprehension, blue calmed me, green gave me a sense of energy, red made me uneasy, and white blinded me, leaving light-blue dots imprinted in my vision.
