After the owner left we all went back to Greg's house, on the way back I kept telling everyone that the owner was the worm and that he represented everything evil in the world, when we got back to Greg's we sat on his front porch overlooking a large field of sheep, while we was sitting there the dreaded owner went down to the field to feed the sheep, when he got their food out they all started running towards their food bin, normally people probably wouldn't really notice it but for me it was one of the coolest things I saw all day.  We stayed at Greg's house pretty late. When we went back to Barry's house Chad and Rachael followed us there. They stayed there for a while but then went home. It was about 3 in the morning and me, Barry, and Griff were wide awake, Barry brought out some of is moms magazines and usually we was making fun of everything his mom liked but for some reason looking at the magazines was fun, we was going through them and deciding which girls we wanted to have sex with.
