I think of my brother and how he described God on our last acid trip, with a group of a dozen people, most of them strangers to me. He said the Hebrew word for God -- Yahweh -- could be a play on how to say I was, I am, and I will be all at once, a way to describe something timeless and eternal. I feel outside of time, like the past, present, and future are stretched out before me. I dont see the past or the future or understand them, I simply feel it. Its as though I have one foot in the river of time and one anchored on the solid ground.
