My confusion and fear had reached new heights, and I lay down on his couch and tried to relax as the rest of my companions played video games.  When I closed my eyes I was overwhelmed with visions of writhing patterns and shapes, of many different colors.  Time seemed to slow to an almost unbearable level - I would open my eyes, gradually remember who I was, where I was, and what I had taken, then look at the clock and realize not even a minute had passed, although it had felt like I had my eyes closed for hours.  This process repeated itself seemingly hundreds of times over the next two hours, and I was sure I was going to go insane.  I kept telling my friend B that I was scared, and that maybe I should just go back to my own house, just so I was safe.  I was certain that at any moment, I would forget everything and be forgotten by everyone - that I would cease to exist. The prospect of that ego-death was horrifying to me, and the resulting resistance I had to it led to the greatest sense of fear and confusion I have ever felt in my life.
