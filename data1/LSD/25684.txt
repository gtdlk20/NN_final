At about 8.30pm or so we ate our cubes. I ate 3. Benny ate 2. Victor ate four (victor, please note, was also on anti-depressants at the time of this trip. zoloft, i think). We decided to go to a friend's graduation party. We picked up Victor's girlfriend and another female acquaintance and headed out.
