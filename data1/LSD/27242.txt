Then we went over to Goku's to dance with glowsticks, and that's where the fun really began. Goku wasn't tripping, but he was high and drunk, and is an incredible dancer. He is the one who taught me to dance, and calls me his prodigy. Anyway, when Goku would dance, it looked like he was constructing a pattern around him, like the Epcot ball. Other times the trails formed weird celtic knots that we couldn't quite figure out. Most of the time it looked like he had four arms, and that his hands were eagle's claws holding blue and yellow medallions. It got crazier, too. Sometimes it looked like the trails were going through his body, shooting out his chest and shit. He would do this weird trick where he would move the glowsticks around my face, and it felt like he was picking my head off my neck, twisting it around and putting it back. His body looked like it was fragmenting into two or four pieces, the way it would look in a shattered mirror. And at one point, when he was really dancing in my face, he was moving his hands back and forth in front of my eyes, and I could see his face THROUGH HIS HANDS!! His hands were translucent or something, and I could see his face clearly, like something you would see in a weird music video. Goku has done a good share of intense shit, but even he had to admit that was crazy. My dancing was good too, but I couldn't really get into it, and I kept dropping the glowsticks. The comforter on the bed had a floral pattern, though, and when the glowstick would fall there, it looked like the liquid inside was combining with the flowers, and the flowers were going into the glowstick.
