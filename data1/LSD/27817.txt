If this sounds rather frightening, it is! At first I felt a great sense of power...... ah, I can direct everything from here! One quickly realizes that this is more of a responsibility than a power. I thought: I'm not qualified for this! Allowing the unconscious to become conscious might not be a good idea... this is like promoting someone with no experience (the ego) to a job they aren't qualified for... but which for the Id is old hat... routine, even dull.
