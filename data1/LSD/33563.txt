After a while C becomes exhausted from walking through sand and sits down with the blunt.  S tells us that we are sitting right next to a path and we are only separated by the hill we are sitting behind.  The blunt is getting very small and I don't think it would be worth it to try to get C to stand up in his state of mind.  S walks off with the blunt and I chase him down and get it back.  I convince him to wait until we can get C up and we finish the blunt as C gathers his items and works his way to his feet.
