'Wait!' I tell him 'I'm not ready to leave.'  S and C both leave and I am stuck either chasing them down or staying at the beach alone.  I chase down C and ask him why we have to leave.  S continues walking.  C gets confused and suddenly tells me that the sand shatters when you walk on it.  I look down and he was correct.  Every step we took caused the sand to create strange patterns all around us.  Seeing me have such a big impact just by walking was an incredible feeling and we started walking around very slowly watching the sand make patterns.
