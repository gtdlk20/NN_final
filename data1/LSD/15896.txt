I went to work feeling amazing and still had the acid in me. I was able to see into people much more when I was working. I was actually preaching to my employees about how awful the management is at my work and how the place was falling apart. Everybody understood what I was saying and completely agreed. After that, I was still tripped out throughout the day. I went home, did my homework, got a good grade on a quiz, and life was going great. I went to school the next morning and took a lot of notes and did great on a test. When I got home from school, I looked outside and it was such a beautiful day. I always had dreamed of tripping on acid during the day in the nature listening to the Beatles on my iPod just in heaven. I decided to do this indeed.
