Finally the drug wore off.  I still couldn't sleep though; I had that strange physical feeling where you're tired but you can't sleep, and you just accept it.  I was almost happy.  I remember thinking on the ride back to Madison - a voyage which was as metaphorical as it was literal; from utter craziness and a lack of reality back home to sanctuary and reality - that although my experience was very frightening, I still wouldn't call it a 'bad trip.'  I had experienced things that most straight people will never experience in three lifetimes.  I tried to tell people about it as I am trying to explain it here, but you really can't because it is an indescribable experience:  'I can't explain; you would not understand. This is not how I am.'  I don't know if I would have done it having known the consequences.   I don't know if I will do it again now knowing the consequences.  I probably will.
