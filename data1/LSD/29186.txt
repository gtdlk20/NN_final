At 15 years old in 1969 I took my first lsd trip and from then up until the middle of the 90s I took lsd whenever it was available. When it was available I would take it weekly which meant I could be taking it for a month or two or just a couple of weeks before it became less available again. Sometimes years passed before it was available again so it was always a bit of a buzz when I came across it again.
