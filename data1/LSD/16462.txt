This lead to a questioning of sexuality in general and an essential, and quite overwhelming distaste for what I saw as a 'mascualine predatory sexual mode' in which my body wanted to do something no matter the consequences.  It felt animal and not human, hormonal rather than reasoned or even emotional to be more precice.  I went mentally into an intense psychological and philisophical thought process of just what it means to be a reasoning animal.  I felt intense shame.  I decided to get some fresh air.  I told Entheogen I'd be back.  She asked if I was okay.  I told her I was fine and I'd tell her if it was going bad at any point.
