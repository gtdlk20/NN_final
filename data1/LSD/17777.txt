Chair and I decided to explore this Nirvana further, and reluctantly left the circle of never-ending smoke.  It was soon forgotten, for the acid was triggering such euphoria and intense happiness that nothing could be regretted.  We gazed in astonishment at the people, each face a shifting psyche wanting to connect to us.  There were women with bells, and I excitedly pointed these out to Chair.  It was nightfall, and we ended up at the central fire, the massive, drum-surrounded heart of the barter faire.  The drums took our breath away - there was a community of drummers harmonizing and any one of the drummers could take the beat to a new level.  There had to be at least thirty drums going at once.  The people were dancing and laughing and blissfully gliding through each other.
