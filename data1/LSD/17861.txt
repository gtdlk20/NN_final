Loops like this can take on a life of their own too, as you seem to almost descend into them. Further and further down into you mind or into the idea youre looping back to. I mentioned to Summer at the time that it was like going down a sinkhole, a sinkhole with paths that wind down around the walls of the hole, going around and around down and down further and further. But what can happen is sometimes you can trip and fall and instead of winding around the wall and walking the path, you fall headlong down into the pit. Reaching places you arent mentally prepared for as you didnt take the path down but fell headlong towards the bottom, giving you a burst of emotion or a burst of thought that can be too powerful for you to handle causing you to react very powerfully to. Either in a good or bad way.
