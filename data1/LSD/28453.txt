Anyway, once we got back I said to my friend that I wanted to go in and listen to the Orb music to really add to the experience.  We separated from each other and I got in my house.  This must have been the early hours of the morning and I knew that its always a good thing to drink a glass of orange juice before going to bed when I've been tripping.
