The archetypes are back there. Those symbols have not just been collecting dust all this time, either. I have been associating things to them constantly all my life, actually, probably eons beyond my present life. Snakes, for example. I saw them there, in a corner. The archetypal reptile. But this time, I made a connection to these snakes that brought them out of the closet of the unconscious mind and into consciousness. These snakes were kundalini energy, the Serpent Power. And what was the serpent power? It was the control of brain muscle. Here I had been storing all this occult symbolism for centuries, and just now I was making the connection between all that occult symbolism and an internally perceivable mind-state. These connections were thrilling to the mind... the mind which keeps everything around, knowing that one day, connections can be made between everything.
