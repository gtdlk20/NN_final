Finally we returned to my friend's house.  That's when we heard Rod Stewart music spewing from outside.  My friends, much more enthusiastic than I at this point, bolted outside to see where it was coming from.  Right then, alone in the room, I felt very overwhelmed, and wanted only to have the trip over with, so much so that I was almost willing to just call my parents and explain everything so that I could get help if possible.  My friends rushed back in, somewhat oblivious to my bad trip, as I was trying very hard not to show it.  Thankfully, my friend sat me down, put on some nice music, and put a magic eye book on my lap, which seemed to calm me down.  After I had come off of my peak, we watched tv, and then played with the snow on the screen.  The rest of the night was wonderful and calm.  So I guess I can say I'm not scared off lsd, but I'd definitely reconsider the environment in which to take it.
