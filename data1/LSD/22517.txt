The moral of the story is the classic truism that set and setting matter. I didn't trust the people we were with. So, I was suspicious of them. When one of them started messing with me mentally it confirmed that I shouldn't trust them. This made me believe that I had to leave. When  I started thinking that I needed to leave the panic set in because I didn't know how I was going to convince my buddy to leave. The more I thought about leaving the more I convinced myself that I absolutely had to leave - that it was necessary for my mental health.
