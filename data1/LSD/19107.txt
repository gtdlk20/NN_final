She dropped me off at my house and I had yet to feel anything.  I did not eat much that day, which turns out to be a not-so-good idea.  I went up to my room and put on King of the Hill on Adult Swim. Suddenly, the acid kicked in.  A character's voice began speaking quite slowly, and I visually saw their mouth moving slowly despite knowing they were not talking like that at all.  This experience distressed me despite being mentally prepared for tripping effects.  My room was dark except for the tv, and watching this strange effect amplified the madness of the acid.  My anxiety grew, and I began feeling detached from reality. I did not lose my cool, but I went downstairs to let my parents know I was going for a night walk (this was a normal occurrence for me and did not spark any issues).
