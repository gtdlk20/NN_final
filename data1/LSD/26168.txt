The party continued for several more hours, and I sort of forgot about the fact that I'd taken any acid.  When I wasn't really paying attention to it, the effects didn't manifest--I had to actually actively try to make hallucinations show up.  I wasn't mentally impaired to a great degree, but I was rather spacey--I was prone to staring off in one direction for a long time without blinking.  (At one point, I was asked, 'What are you on?  We can't figure it out,' so I suppose I was obviously intoxicated, even though I didn't think I looked that way.)
