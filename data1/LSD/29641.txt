I have a reasonably extensive experience with serotonergics, cannabinoids, and somewhat eclectic experience with various other assorted psychoactives, with honorable mention for dopaminergic stimulants, which I currently do my best to avoid. By the time of this experience, I have developed a relatively high long-term tolerance for psychedelics, although my short-term tolerances are currently low.
