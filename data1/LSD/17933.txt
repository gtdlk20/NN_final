When I got there, my mind was somewhat racing, but it was still possible to connect in a good-natured way. I feel somewhat shy and awkward, but it seems always possible to get along with a little humor and honesty. They had another fellow visiting who showed us the scars on his abdomen where he had been nearly severed in a motorcycle accident when he was pinned between a semi and a car. Wow. The girls and he had been drinking and had snorted a little speed. We just hung out watching music videos and talking. The other chap left around 3 or 4am, and I stayed until dawn. I had some unrequited love-type feelings for one of the girls, who was very attractive, but it seemed to be okay to just experience that lustful feeling without trying to particularly act on it. I finally walked home as the sun was coming up and enjoyed the sunrise and feeling of activity starting to pick up in the small town.
