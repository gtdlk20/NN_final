The rest of the peak is hard to remember.  We slowly picked up the pieces of our shattered egos, and started to remember ourselves again.  It was as though we werenÂ’t even together during the peak.  I do recall a closed eye visual of a sort of alchemical chart arranged in such a way that explained how life on earth worked.  It was some very advanced stuff, tying the setting and rising of our sun in to the beating of the mammalian heart and the slow-furnace nature of the body.  I just wish I remembered what the answer to what life was a little more clearly.
