I am pleased with the result of the experience, but I implore anyone who takes a new supply of any drug to always get the most sense of what they should expect vis-Ã -vis dose. There were moments where I believed my body couldn't take the experience and that I would require hospitalization. Luckily for me I was experienced enough to hang on tight and ride it out. But not everyone will be adequately prepared to dissolve into their vibratory state. Please be wise with these experiences, and only dose yourself this high knowingly and with the full expectation of it being nightmarish and disturbing.
