About 45 minutes after eating this rather Large 'wad' of white blotter paper, I started to feel something. It was an excited feeling, but anxious too, because I knew that I had just ate a lot of acid. Indeed I had, and about 1 hour into the trip I began realizing what I was in for. The room started spinning wildly, and so I sat down on the living room couch downstairs, by myself. I looked across the room at the wallpaper which was a simple diagonal mesh pattern with diamonds in between the lines. The wall seemed to be 'breathing' in and out, which I've heard is a common effect while on LSD, but the wall was moving pretty far in distance as it did this. I began to notice that the pattern of the wallpaper was making some kind of 'noise', and I didn't want to hear it anymore so closed my eyes.
