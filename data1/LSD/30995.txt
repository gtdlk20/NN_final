I looked around me, and the weirdest part was that all of these feelings came about on a purely superficial level. It wasnt like I had immersed myself in the details surrounding many of the times thrown all over the place. Just by looking, just by simply noticing one, tiny little thing, the whole feel became different. It became richer, it expanded and grew inside me, until I couldnt process it anymore.
