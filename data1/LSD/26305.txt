The ride back to my friendÂ’s house only took 10 minutes and it was almost erotic.  The vehicle floated around every corner and the blackness of the asphalt never stopped expanding.  Anxiety from this set in to me and it infested my tonal as I became a lost cause.  There was no turning back now.  I began to forget what it was like to be normal.  I felt like I had been tripping my entire life and I knew no different.  I knew that I must have been climaxing at that point.  I had no grounds on what to compare my state to, reality seemed a dream I wanted to return to.
