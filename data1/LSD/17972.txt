It was late April, and my friend (let's call him E) had the house to himself while his dad was in Mexico. The two of us had been strengthening our friendship through weed, and frequently talked about engaging in psychedelic experiences. He told me he had a plug nearby where he could buy 350 microgram tabs for cheap. I was ecstatic, of course, as I had only previously taken a small dose of 75 micrograms ( the results were significant, but nothing to write home about necessarily).
