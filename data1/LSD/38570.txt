A few hours before entrance we had gone to a couple of pubs and had some alchohol (I've never seen too much of a hazard of mixing small amounts of drink with other drugs) and managed to have ourselves a bit of a smoke.  I had to smoke via a pipe coz I can't stand tobacco so I'm Mr Neat.  George prefers Skunk so Skunk it was.
