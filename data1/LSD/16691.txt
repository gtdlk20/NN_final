When we had been in the comfort of the springs for quite some time we decided it was time to go back and set up our camp.  On the way back we had flashlights and got to see the whole endeavor in the light, which was interesting.  At the camp we set up my tent and then all huddled in one of my friends tents, eating granola and chocolate and covering ourselves with blankets to stay warm.
