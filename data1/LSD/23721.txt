wail!  I would describe it as a wail of a dying Banshee.  It was long, shrill and painful and sounded, I would imagine, like a witch being burned at the stake.  This startled but also fascinated me, and I was not at all scared but rather perplexed.  I always have auditory hallucinations on Cannabis, which I use alone to boost my creativity and philosophical thinking, so maybe I was just used to trippy noises.
