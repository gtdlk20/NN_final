Everything seemed to be great until I realized I wasn't coming down from the trip after about five to six days. I continued to meditate to alleviate the immense energy that I felt, but this didn't stop me for experiencing visuals and other characteristics of the substance at times, and I couldn't meditate as extensively as I could before.
