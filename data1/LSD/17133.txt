Living in Ft. Worth in spring of 1999, my brother one day brought home a strip of purple paper, and gave me 'about 4 hits worth'.  I still to this day have not been able to find out where he got it, what the name of that particular street paper was, or if that really was 4 hits.  However about two days later I decided to give half the strip a go, since I had a day off.  At the time, I had no alcohol in my system, nor any other drugs besides a couple of bottles of Coca Cola.
