The guys figured out some way to power a laptop and lamp, I think from some massive backup battery supply, and put in a Simpsons DVD. I just stood and stared at colors I had never seen before, out of the visual color spectrum. I am usually an avid Simpsons fan, but I was so distracted I am completely unable to say what episode we watched, or even what characters were involved. At some point here I received several 1mg alprazolam tablets. Shortly after this, I and one friend managed to get to my room --- next door.
