Only 2 hits of LSD this time... but it was quite enough. Again, the start time was late at night. I lie in bed. My brain and body thought that they were preparing for a night's sound sleep... heh heh, little did they know. Shortly, I began to stretch out in my bed, much as a dragon would awaken at the scent of battle. I felt the wind. Not the physical wind in the atmosphere, but the psychic wind that permeates all things (of which more later).....it swept through me, awakening with a tingle the dormant energy within me. I began to writhe in its glorious unearthly currents. The visuals emerged, separating out from their usual role as scaffolding in the structure of reality, and exposing themselves for my manipulation. They were part of ME. It wasn't long before I was again the conductor of an alien orchestra... the orchestra of my brain. I literally swept the LSD visuals into their structure as the representation of my brain... or else they assembled themselves.
