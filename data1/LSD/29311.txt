All in all, the movie felt like it lead me into a fantastic trip the rest of the night. Like it was guiding me through it almost. It felt as if the movies was years long, but was over before it started. The rest of the night was amazing as soon as I got home and felt safe. However, watching this movie allowed me to fully think and feel like a 6 year old, fully understanding that i was only imagining everything, yet still actually seeing these fucked up adults as fun, brutal monsters. It may have been a masterpiece of a movie, I may have been blown, or it was both.
