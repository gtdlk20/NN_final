I apologize to C for causing such an embarrassing scene.  It wasn't that I was afraid or anything, I just never considered the fact that other people wouldn't want to be pushed.  I could easily have stayed in line, I just didn't want to stay there that long with everyone staying with me, and it seemed perfectly logical to do what I wanted.  C asks where we are going and I say I don't know, maybe we should look for S.  He tells me that it's S's fault for getting lost and we should ride rides.  We see the corkscrew for the second time and I decide that this is the perfect opportunity to gauge how the acid effects the ride.
