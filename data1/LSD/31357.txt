So the first thing I noticed was that the clouds in the sky started to morph, and I managed to interpret some cartoonish faces. After the LSD had entered my system the effects were quite acute and sudden in terms of onset. I managed to sit up and observe my surroundings in the park. The ground seemed to move in waves like an ocean, with the grass changing into a multitude of different colours and patterns. It was like I was in an ocean of pure bliss. The sky and ground seemed to move as one, sort of like a conjoined entity. I saw a couple walking in the distance, and felt like I could connect to them both emotionally and experience the love that they have for each other. Now at this point, I realised what I had gotten myself into. This was getting pretty intense for me, due to the fact that my sense of reality had already started to distort. I managed to find a tree nearby, and sort of telepathically connected to it. Asking it for guidance without words (in a way). Now, this tree seemed to tell me that I needed to go home and sit this out in my bedroom (Which to be honest seemed to be quite a sensible idea, tripping balls in a public space like that could have gotten me in serious danger). Rather than make me panic, I managed to retain myself and wandered to the entrance of the park. At this point everything was warping around me and it's probably a miracle that I managed to make it home unscathed. The concrete below me was 'breathing', and I sort of felt interconnected with everything. I stumbled onto a bus and hitched a ride home.
