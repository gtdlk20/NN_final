This proved to be the most difficult part of the trip, because apparently it is not very easy to put on and tie a pair of shoes when you are on two tabs of high quality blotter acid. We were jabbering away and jumping around like lunatics in the parking lot while trying to get the shoes on.  SÂ’s emotions were changing at a very rapid pace, from sweet to scared to angry to yelling to cute to sad, and this made it quite difficult.  We got the shoes on eventually.
