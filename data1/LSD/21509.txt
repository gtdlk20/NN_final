10:30-ishI was almost done smoking my cig. J had gone back in, and I remained outside trying to straighten my mind out. For some reason, his argument that he was my double seemed reasonable, but I couldnt accept it. I finally got my head straightreasonablyand turned to go back in, when I realized there were people coming over from across the parking lot. Paranoia set in like a ton of bricks. I ran inside, shut the door, and went into the bathroom. Once inside, I completely forgot why Id come back in, and proceeded to take a piss. Coming back out into the living room, I noticed the other guys kinda freaking, and I asked what was up. W told me these people had come in, one chick wearing a weird mask, and he had scared her off by staring and touching the mask to make sure she was real. I had no clue what he was talking about. The people had completely slipped my mind!
