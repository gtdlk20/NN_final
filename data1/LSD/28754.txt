Once I got home, it was so hard to get back up the stairs and into my room, I was too freaked out to turn on the lights and knocked over an entire table full of stuff since I was still tripping. I tried taking a shower, and when I looked in the mirror again my entire body was still really red (of course this was still in my imagination).
