The indoor section of the line was very dark lit and had a lot of bright colors and 3d effects everywhere.  It was very pleasant but my visuals had stopped and it was nothing too insane. After the line moved forward a bit there was a green substance splattered on the wall that appeared to be crawling.  I asked S if the green thing looked like it was moving around to him and a few people gave me sketchy looks.  I smiled to myself.
