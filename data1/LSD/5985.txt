There was a lot of these sheets of blank blotter floating around for awhile, and I went back to the guy who had gifted me my tabs and told him what I suspected it was, and urged him to be open and honest about what he was selling. Dont call it acid unless its LSD, thats just being dishonest. There will definitely be people interested in trying DOB. Im all about knowing exactly what you are taking.
