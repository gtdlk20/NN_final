Ive been a sponge for this whole trip. Ive just been absorbing so much, and you girls produce! You and Dianna, you guys are so talented, and I just want to know people as talented as you. My talents, well, they dont really come through. I quit them, because they didnt fit in my life, and it means theyre not important to me. Im a messenger, I hold a voice, not the voice, yeah that should be close to what I said. I wasnt really explaining myself, as much as I was giving her excuses on my artistic laziness. To this day, this remains one of the most daunting moments of my life. I was so sure my future and destiny would have led me to a longing for creativity myself, that it scared me. Forever wishing, forever absorbing, and never creating.
