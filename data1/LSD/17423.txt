I've done a lot of drugs in my life, and i find that the most profound experiences and insights they've given me are the hardest to express.  I believe they're even ineffable in a direct sense, though one can hint at them and convey at least some of the intended meaning.  This is my attempt to share my most 'profound' drug experience for whatever benefit any readers can glean from it.
