We returned to the bed (I had replaced my clothing), the cat sticking by my side for some reason, and tried to again find the calm comfy place we were. I couldn't find it. I could hear everything at once. Screaming children, running faucets, footsteps, conversations, the pipes being worked on downstairs and it all came from everywhere and nowhere. It was horrible. I started to cry. I thought of the sharks sticker in the bathroom, the bullet holes in the window, the phantom image of a toddler running by it I had experienced much earlier and while not all drug impaired. I decided then that he had been shot to death and cried even harder.
