Without significant physical sensation from my left ear, the following two changes occurred simultaneously: a high-pitched noise began to my left, reminiscent in timbre to white noise with the lower registers muted, without any noticeable attack; and the subjective location of the music panned sharply rightwards. Within the next minute, the noise faded almost out of perceptibility, while the source of music retained its new subjective angle. Throughout this experience, the computer playing the music was entirely in my field of vision, so I was consciously aware that it had not moved.
