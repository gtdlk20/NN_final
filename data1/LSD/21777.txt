I immediately noticed my head getting insanely heavy. I couldnt resist it, and it pulled it down to my shoulder and I felt my brain dipping its toe into the Tripworld. I snapped out of it immediately, noticing the walls covered in crawling fur, but then my head became heavy again and rolled to the other side, and it splashed again, and I mouthed in an exaggerated way woahh.
