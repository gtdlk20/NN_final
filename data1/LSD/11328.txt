I soon remembered my friends and ran a feet feet back to warn them in case they needed to yell something about acid. Then we all walked across to the other side of the beach and layed on the bank of the river; more than safe from the view of the fisherman. I'm not really sure if he could hear us or not though.  If he could, I'm sure he could probably tell that we were on drugs or something to that nature. Awful townspeople...
