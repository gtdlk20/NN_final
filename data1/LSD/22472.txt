Despite taking the LSD at 11.30am in the morning, I could feel a funny feeling in my chest and had racing thoughts until I finally fell asleep at 5am in the morning. I believe this was not caused by the LSD per se, but rather by some slight anxiety that I was never going to feel sober again and would be permanently in a psychotic state.
