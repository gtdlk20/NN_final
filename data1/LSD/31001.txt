It was in human nature to be cruel. Like Seth. Seth had been cruel to me. And he always popped up. I dont know why I had some sort of notion that I was over him, or that drugs would have made me over him, because despite the deeply-felt heart-to-heart Id had with Summer the previous day, he was still there! Still monopolizing and dictating me and making me wonder, what had I done wrong? Why had I lost him. Why didnt I see him anymore. Wait. I was the one not seeing him anymore, not the other way around!
