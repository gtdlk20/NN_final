I remember at one point Im standing behind this black gate thing while shes in the driveway on the other side and the edges of the black bars of the gate began to vibrate and I wanted to laugh at it and point it out because I knew it wasnt normal and it had to be the LSD but knew I would just look like a werido but man the blackness of the bars vibrating was really cool looking and how my eyes kept changing their levels of focus on certain objects. The architecture there was interesting, it was like this strange black gating on top of this brick wall and with thorny rose bushes and roses behind it the whole area had a semi gothic appeal looking back on it now. Even had a bit of a dark bricky but ecclesiastical appeal or at least it seemed that way. Id probably appreciate it much more now.
