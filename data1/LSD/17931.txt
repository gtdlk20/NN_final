I'm not sure how to explain this part, but somehow the trip transitioned. It was about 11pm, and I recall not knowing what to do with myself, so I called up the girls who had sold me the acid. They were two very cute lesbians, possibly bisexual, and they invited me over to their apartment to hang out. Still feeling very high, and now somewhat sexually excited, I got myself together enough to walk over to their place. The evening air was cool and refreshing, and the walk of 1.5 to 2 miles was very grounding.
