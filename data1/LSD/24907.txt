I realized how this body and all of its maintenance/ methologics/ procedures/ and mechanical processes--such as eating, pissing, drinking, sex, washing, and shitting, chain down the psyche and pollute and corrupt pure thought. Once we are free from this body, only thought will exist. Pure thought without the chains of the body and all its weight, just may be the highest evolution of humanity.
