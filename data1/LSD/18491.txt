I remember going outside with D and just staring at the sky and skyline from my balcony.  The skyline seemed very movie like.  The light of the city and moon seemed to getter darker and lighter.  One moment it felt like first dawn then midnight, then dawn again, etc..  After a while I felt like I had been standing there for days.  I felt how old the earth, universe and stars were.  D and I hardly said a word but it was not awkward.  At one point she leaned over towards me, I had the urge to kiss her but decided with surprising lucidity that this, considering our current state, probally was not the best time to start something.  We both head back in and I swear I saw an aura around D and it was sadness and dissapointment.  'Of course I'm tripping balls so who knows?', I remember that thought vividly for some reason.
