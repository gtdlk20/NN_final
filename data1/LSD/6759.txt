It seemed to take forever for B to arrive, but once he did, we put in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and sat down to watch.  Oddly enough, though I was still grilling incredibly hard, once B was there, talking with a fellow LSD user (though he was completely straight at the time) and the comedic atmosphere of the movie combined to make me feel much better.  At this point I would say I was having a good time again.  B and I hung out for several hours that night, but when he went home at about 11 pm, I was still completely fried.  I stayed up most of the night reading Greek myth and listening to Pink Floyd.  I think I finally came down somewhere around noon the next day, but felt odd and slightly tweaky for a good week or so afterwards.  Also, previous to this experience, I'd never really had any lasting after-effects from doing hallucinogens, but to this day I still see tracers and what I refer to as 'rainbow trash', a sort of static-like colorful profusion of afterimages that lightly sprinkle my vision.  I understand that these are symptoms of HPPD, though they have never really caused me any particular problems, and they have subsided somewhat with time.
