	At a different park (not sure why), my brother comes to buy a sack from my buddy. He comes over talks to me for a bit. Leaves, then I hear him calling back at me with a sort of excitement in his tone. He runs back over to show me some pictures of some newly budding plants heÂ’d been working on. I must of got the excitement from his vibes. I immediately have this huge smile on my face as he explains his photos. I could feel the light from the phone on my skin, and it was as though the light being reflected on me was exuding from my every pore. With a body high of nothing I have ever felt.
