All of a sudden what was happening sunk in, it was amazing, everything in my house was incredible to look at, to touch! I then couldnÂ’t stop smiling as I ran around the house like an idiot feeling and looking at different things, each one just as amazing as the next. Soon I found myself looking at all our pictures on the walls. One painting in particular, well two they are meant to be put together and were sold as a set. The sides that face each other are a rich yellow with blots of red and the outer sides indiscernible people shaped patterns each a different colour. Staring at these paintings was amazing as the once stationary red blots were now jumping between the pictures with amazing trails. I could not stop it happening, relaxing or concentrating my eyes did nothing, it was just how I saw it.
