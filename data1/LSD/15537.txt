I drifted in and out of what felt like consciousness, gibberish persistently echoed around my head in this scratchy old sounding English accent??! My heart was racing and I nothing was as it seems, the walls of my room were convulsing and pulsating, periodically the whole room would appear to tilt on a 45 degree angle. Still realising that this is was in fact just the LSD and that it would eventually go away, I just put up with it and shut my eyes. It may not have been an all that unpleasant experience if no one was going to be home in a few hours. I would probably have had loosened up a bit and not been in such a state. But at the time I kept thinking why have it taken this? Will I ever be normal again? I missed normality. But thats were I was and I had to deal with it, it did get quite terrifying at times and I shuddered to think that this was only one tabs work and couldnt imagine what taking five or something tabs would be like. Not getting any better I figured Id put on the TV again, this did wonders as I would have a few seconds at a time where I knew what was going on. Then just a quickly as Id recover my consciousness would be ripped from the side of my head again.
