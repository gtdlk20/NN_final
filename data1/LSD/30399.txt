About 10 minutes later, I was sure I was tripping. My friend took me into his room and played some techno and trance for me and let me watch his winamp visual on his computer. The visuals completely captivated me. They colors were more brilliant than normal, and at times the screen looked like it was bubbling and the glass was being melted off. Pieces of color looked like they were about to pop out of the screen. At this point, wasn't having any difficulty organizing thoughts in my head and the body load was no where as strong as when I take shrooms. My mind was clear, and I was able to function pretty normally for the most part.
