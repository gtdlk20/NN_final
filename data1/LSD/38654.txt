A few weeks ago after a local concert a friend of mine named Chris and I had nothing to do, and it was about 1:30am. I offered him to trip with me and we both dropped a ten strip of pink elephant blotter. We are both experienced acid heads who've done that much before, so we weren't expecting anything out of the ordinary which is why we didn't get a sitter.
