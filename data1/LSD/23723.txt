A number of minor events occurred, such as me hallucinating doors opening and closing, and patterns in the ceiling.  One major realisation was that my tubby ginger cat was with me throughout the trip, which was startling as he never even sits by me usually.  His ears were pointing towards all my auditory hallucinatios and it was as if he was protecting me in some way, and guiding me throughout the trip.  He could hear everything I heard and could even sense my emotions, as he always started comforting me as I started feeling the trip was too much.
