I had managed to pick up about two 100ug tabs off of a very nice dealer that I used to know (he's dropped out of the business unfortunately), and I intended to drop them in the middle of a park, ride it out and go home later that night. My reasoning for doing this at a park was because I couldn't really afford to drop it with my parents in the house (again). I still to this day have no idea why I couldn't have just waited for a better set and setting, and do it with a friend that I trust. I have ADHD, so my naturally impulsive behaviour may play a role in my quite frankly stupid decision making at the time.
