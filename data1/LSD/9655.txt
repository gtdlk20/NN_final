IÂ’d hit the peak of my trip and was coming down here and it felt as if I had hit the peak of my life and now I am coming down. I have appeased my mind and now I must appease my body. It felt as though the rest of my life could never quite humble me the way this trip did and it would be a downward spiral into the contemplation of death as it approached and I would no longer ever be as blissfully naive as I was prior to this trip. I watched some trippy videos on the computer that only reimbursed my theories in a weird yet acid like way, I listened to some psy/goa trance and watched the visuals. Throughout the whole trip most of my visuals had been fractal/spiral based, seeing little fractals make up every individual colour I saw and then seeing everything I saw make up an even bigger fractal which was then tied to my thought patterns and that of evolution and history making up fractals, then humans, habits, lifestyles etc. but one interesting thing was that I actually started hearing in fractals at this point, little fractals of sound or the sine waves being digested in my ears as little spirals that got digested through their sine waves into the language of perception.
