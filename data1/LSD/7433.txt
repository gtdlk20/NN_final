I guess it was probably around 3pm when we arrived at that spot, and 5pm when we started heading home. The dark cloud to our left slowly grew bigger and more threatening. It didnt concern me much, but my friend wanted to make sure we didnt have to go back up the hill in the rain. For that reason, we decided to leave once the sun went behind it.
