Towards the end of my trip, my mother walked into my room to find me without anything on, tripping balls and seemingly unconscious. She called my father and a paramedic, fortunately I was coming out of my journey at this time. When I came to my senses, I had never felt more ashamed of myself, at how stupid I was. How could I disappoint my mother like that? Nevertheless, it wasn't a bad trip at all. It's just the disappointment I experienced afterwards.
