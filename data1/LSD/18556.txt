I woke up early, at 7 am, to dose myself at 8. I had to work that evening at 10pm, and this has always been a sufficient enough timeframe to be normal enough to do a passable job. I made myself a tea, and took the two tabs. Normally, I find that it takes my body about an hour to an hour and a half to process the drug and for the come up to begin. This time, it only took 30 minutes for the beginning stages of the experience to manifest. This time, it only took 30 minutes for the beginning stages of the experience to manifest.
