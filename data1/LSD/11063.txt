Around 7:15pm we all took our doses. While waiting to come up we chilled in my dorm room and listened to some tunes. After about 15 minutes I swallowed my blotter and could already feel the familiar tingle. We put a DVD in my computer with all the Smashing Pumpkin music videos, and we watched a few of them. By the third music video I was already paying equal attention to the vibrant and changing colors of everything in the room.
