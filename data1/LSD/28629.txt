The first 4 or so hours of the trip were marvelous.  It snowed 2 feet overnight, and I watched it--on three hits of acid.  The snowflakes cast the most intriguing shadows under the low-intensity lamp outside of my dorm, and they seemed to be undulating in large, beautiful shapes, spinning through and amongst each other like some kind of non-aggressive bee tribe, swirling and shooting back and forth.  I was so incredibly overwhelmed I sat down in the snow, wearing, thankfully, heavy clothing, and began to trip the fuck out.  At that point, I started getting the Fear very briefly, but luckily, I got a kiss on the cheek and magically, as if a lukewarm substance were injected into me, I started to have the most amazing visuals.  Returning to my room (because it was balls in your stomach cold) I ran into an RD who was, thankfully, Drunk out of his mind.  I reached my room and hallucinated for about 3 hours with the two girls.
