Entheogen is very interested in the video and flash work that Larry Carlson does.  So inevitably, we ended up watching one of his long works.  I must be quite candid and say that she had shown me his stuff before, and the sad truth is, it quite literally creeped me out to no end.  I found it interesting, but also very unnerving on a kind of subconcious level.  I was nervous about watching any of his stuff, because I feared it would turn into one of those bad trips.  But oddly enough, it was simply facinating to me.  This brought about Acid Epiphany #2.  It was a great counterpoint to Epiphany #1: We don't always have to be effected by things.  It's somtimes good to hold your head above water and just look down calmly.  I must note here that I constantly think in contradictions anyway.  I believe, to quote F. Scott Fitzgerald 'The test of a first-rate intelligence is the abilty to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.'.
