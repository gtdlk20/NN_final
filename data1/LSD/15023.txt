I am the product of a decidedly tumultuous adolescence and young adulthood, but from what better cloth are writers cut? I've recently become more confident and sure of myself than perhaps at any time in my life, and I came to the conclusion that in the different phases I had passed through, I had been attempting to define particular aspects of myself and then attempting to define myself as that aspect alone. It has only been recently, and especially after this experience, that I've been able to see the whole picture and truly come to terms with who I ultimately am.
