I don't think LSD really helped this problem, nor have any of the other drugs I've done in my life -- cannabis, alcohol, dxm, mdma, cocaine, shrooms, everything. They don't solve the problem, they just distort it. LSD gave me a rude awakening though, a lesson from God, more or less. But indeed, I did intrude on God's turf for a few hours. I just hope I can learn from this experience as much as possible, especially without having the need to use again, as I do not want to put myself through this again, and I don't think it was meant to be.
