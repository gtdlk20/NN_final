Eventually, the maniac energy which had possessed me throughout the day gave way to an exalted, happy weariness, much like the one that accompanies a a day of hard but ultimately successful labor.  I retired to my bedroom, and began to stare at the ceiling.  Chunks of drywall began to bulge and drip from the walls and ceiling, only to dissipate into a thin smoke.  The smoke would drift a few feet from its point of origin, and then lazily make its way back into the gap.  Soon enough,  I began to ponder the nature of the universe in a general way, which led me specifically to thoughts of black holes.  Not a moment after I had begun this train of thought, a small black vortex opened up in the center of the ceiling with an audible stretching noise.  It grew larger and larger, and upon reaching the size of a basketball began to exude ribbons of the colored smoke-light that I had seen earlier.  They were very bright, primary colors, the exact shades on a kindergarten color chart.  They began to revolve around the room, picking up speed as they went.  Eventually the colors began to band together, and soon the room was a circus of colors all racing through each other and intertwining.  All at once, the mystery of the tie-dyed t shirt was no mystery to me.  The night ended with me laughing myself to sleep.
