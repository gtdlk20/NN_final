I first became interested in LSD when I accidently stumbled across an LSD article in the dentist's waiting room.  The article told briefly of the commonly experienced psychadelics of LSD.  I had never really given LSD a second thought in the past, but after cross-examining it I felt as if I was missing out on something.  I decided to start researching the drug and also contacted a few individuals that I knew had used LSD.
