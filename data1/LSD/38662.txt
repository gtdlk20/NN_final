Next thing I can remember we're in a soccer field sitting on some bleachers the aligators are still there, but I've found out they don't want me, right now all of the alligators are fighting and fucking each other and are ignoring me for now. As we walk into the field there is a force field constructed by diamond shapes and as I walk through I can feel it. The stars in the sky have turned red and are shooting out white light. I look across the street and see dinosaurs, I ignore them. Holy shit there are 2 cars pulling into the field, are they cops? My friend assures me they are not and I hear a robotic voice yell 'get over here' Chris tells me he didn't hear anything. I begin to power walk back to Shaun's.
