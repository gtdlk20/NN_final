When we finally arrived it was dark and we were glad to stretch our legs.  We were meeting more friends at the springs, but we had no cell phone coverage, the springs were about a mile hike away and we didn't have any idea how to get there.  We found a friendly hippy who was sitting outside his van with friends and I agreed to give him an eighth of mushrooms in return for guiding us to the springs.
