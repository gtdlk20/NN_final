I've taken acid quite a few times in the past. I've had many good trips, such as wandering in what seemed like an enchanted forest with friends to extremely bad trips like hours of not being able to breath properly with my heart pounding in my ears. I've never had a trip even remotely like the one I had about fifteen years ago.
