Acid was an extremely out of this world experience and all I want to do is try it again, when I won't be throwing up or inside. I would love to be outside in the day time the next time I do it. I don't think I ever had much of a panic during the trip, just physical illness that bothered me, and luckily I gathered it in me to overcome this.
