So, at about 1:00 AM (T+06:00), our pockets loaded with thirty-nine total golf balls (yes, we counted them), we arrived back at the apartment. To our surprise, the mushroom children were huddled on the floor, clinging to a few oversized bean bag chairs, watching 'Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas.' Satisfied that our night had been a productive one thusfar, Lex and I joined in the ordeal and watched intently as the movie seemed to make less and less sense by the minute. By the time the movie ended, circa 2:20 AM, I could feel the acid beginning to wane in intensity. For the next several hours, we sat and watched the blinds covering the screen door, as we could discern rainbow-like patterns emerging from the cracks between them.
