All in all the trip was amazing during the day. It was a very interesting experience. LSD is probably the strangest drug I have ever taken. The night was difficult, but I made it through. I learned that I like shrooms a lot better. I've never had a difficult experience on shrooms and this is why I like them over LSD. Every shroom experience has been highly pleasurable and a life changing journey. LSD was pleasurable at first, but difficult at the end. It wasn't the least bit life changing, just mind altering. VERY mind altering.
