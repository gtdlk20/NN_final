5. [+2:30] A long period of enlightenment or paranoia, immersion with experience or being completely confused by it... The present keeps trying to push its own urgency in my face. Jitter, jitter, jitter. Losing myself in my own crazy mind loops. A need to move or wander around. Keep receiving new data, new places, new new new... I don't get very strong visuals as expected. I always imagined things would change shape, distort, etc... But I get no significant visuals unless I fix my eyes on something static for a few seconds, and then I kinda zoom into the tiny details and my mind drifts into this pixelated fractal vision.
