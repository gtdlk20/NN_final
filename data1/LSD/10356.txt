As for my previous argument about LSD versus DXM, Dex still holds the title for most intense. Never once did I feel like I couldnÂ’t handle what acid had to show me. Never was I panicked or confused which is fairly common in the midst of a robo-trip. LSD and DXM are nearly opposite in how they affected me. All of the visuals on LSD were external. Everything that I saw, heard and felt, came from outside. I tried to close my eyes at one point, curious to see if I would still hallucinate, but I did not. DXM requires no external stimulus at all and closing my eyes often increases the depth and intensity of the trip. This, among other chemical synergies between LSD and DXM leads me to wonder what taking both would be like.
