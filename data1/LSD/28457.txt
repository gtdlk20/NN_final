Of course I started to panic and the experience got worse and worse.  I then had the images that I was seeing, merging into each other all around me.  Every image around me - what was a toaster, what was a kettle, what was an orange juice carton, a chair, they all started merging into each other and I was seeing images as though they were monsters approaching me from the left again and again and again.
