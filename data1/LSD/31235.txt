Summer seemed tired as we made our way downstairs again. My little computer of a mind was trying, more or less helplessly, to process the elevator, the exit, the cooler air outside... but still, nothing made any sense. As soon as we were in Union Square again, I asked Summer how she was feeling: Are you still tripping?
