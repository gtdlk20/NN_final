	I noticed the first effects about 30-45 minutes in, nothing profound or too extreme, just mild color distortion and a slightly fuzzy head. Driving, looking for a place to burn some trees the acid was coming on nicely. Before departing from the car to partake in the sweet embrace of Mary Jane, we each take a second hit. ItÂ’s about 12:00.
