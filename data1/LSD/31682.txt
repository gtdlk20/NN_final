I couldn't sleep so I drifted through my thoughts and wandered. In the morning I got myself ready and went to our hospital's new unit's inauguration. I was in an impatient state and to go out in the real normal life while not being so normal, it's hard to keep level-headed. But somehow I made through it. It was ironic that I was on drugs, and I went to a hospital. But finally, somehow, after what seemed like ages I was back home, and I went off to sleep. When I got up I was still my extra conscious, but I was back to normal self, the old patterns and habits started taking hold. Yet in a certain way, every time I trip on LSD, I change parts of myself in a good way. But we have to be really careful with substances like this, as there is only a fine line between the vast unexplored planes of the consciousness. My next trip will be after a long time. Peace to everyone out there and keep spreading knowledge and information.
