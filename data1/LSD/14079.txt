T=3:30: I closed my eyes and suddenly envisioned being reincarnated as a caveman for about a minute.  Then a different caveman.  Then a woman.  Then an African tribesman.  Then a rainforest tribesman.  Then something genderless entirely, possibly from another planet, seemingly some imagined hypothetical species.  'All my best trips were on LSD' began to run through my mind like a mantra.  It was strange.  Time was very slow now.  I seemed to live out significant life experiences of other hypothetical people, other hypothetical creatures in general each over the span of about 30-60 seconds.  I kept re-checking my phone for time and I remember each of these episodes was barely a minute if even that.  The circular 4-way fractal patterns overlaid on the imagined reincarnations; the trip had taken on a sort of recursive character.  The mantra replaying in my mind, the imagined reincarnations, and the visual patterns each 'reset' every 30-60 seconds or so.
