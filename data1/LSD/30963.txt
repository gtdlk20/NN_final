But instead of being richly involved into another world, I remained in the dimension of feelings Id been previously exploring, until i closed my eyes. Closing my eyes was interesting. Id say I wasnt Tripping hard!!!1111,, but I definitely had compelling closed-eye visuals. It was mostly mandalas, and typical LSD-esque tubular designs, moving around in teal, golden orange, and this iridescent purple/magenta color. All the shades were extremely vivid, but the shape of what I was looking at exactly seemed unclear. It was all relatively dark, and I had to dig deep to let it fully overtake me. All in all, I thought that I hadnt taken enough of Lucys juice to be actually optically enthralled, but boy was I wrong.
