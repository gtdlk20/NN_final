My trip started out as usual. I had decided to just take a little liquid (6 drops; it was decent, but not great acid) by myself and just mellow out to Pink Floyd and contemplate cosmic questions and life in general. I decided to go for a walk around my block because it had begun to rain and i thought that would be interesting. It was around midnight and i'd dropped at around 10:30pm, so i was tripping pretty good. After completing my lap, i went back into a field on a hill behind my house and spun around in the rain and stared at the storm clouds and lightning bolts dancing across the sky. As i stood on the hill, i tensed up all the muscles in my body, held my breath and made my face turn red (like you would when you're taking a really intense shit, for lack of a better example).
