On our way out of the station, we saw an elderly woman, who wore an all-black outfit consisting of leather pants, a cowboy hat, and cowboy boots. Her straight red hair was up in a tight ponytail. She noticed the giddy looks in our faces, and immediately smiled back, telling us, You three look beautiful together! For how long have you been friends?
