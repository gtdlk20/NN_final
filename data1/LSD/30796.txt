I have shared this experience with two other girls, who have now become my Acid Sisters. The first is my closest friend here in New York, Summer. Summer and I have been friends for almost a year now, and we have a lot in common spiritually, which I was aware of even before the trip. The other girl is Dianna. Shes been friends with Summer, also for a significant amount of time, but before this experience we werent awfully close - nevertheless, I did like Dianna a lot.
