LSD marked my culmination with hallucinagetic drugs.  Beginning in my earlier days with marijuana I soon grew bored and used mushrooms.  It wasn't long after that I did a little research through reputable websites and other reliable sources.  LSD seemed safe enough so long as one is in control of one's emotions so I tried it.  I slipped a little piece of paper under my tongue for a few minutes, and then I took a few bong hits.
