We got home and I asked if we could sit outside for a few because I really wanted to talk more with my mom. I asked if we could sit outside for a few because I really wanted to talk more with my mom. We ended up talking in a full blown 2 hour conversation and looking back I feel like it was so helpful to our relationship and my understanding of our relationship. At this point I'm just staring at the brick walkway we have and seeing so many patterns in it (mind you my mom still and as I'm writing this doesn't know I was tripping) I got a call from my work saying I needed to come in which was really sucky because I wasn't going to get sleep that night but after I ended the call, I then for some reason really want to go on a walk seeing as we live in basically the middle of nowhere (we don't really have signal except 1 bar so unless we have wifi we don't get calls on our cell phone until we go about 20 minutes away from where we live). So here me and my mom are walking (I also didn't feel out of breath at all like I normally do with my asthma) and it was so enjoyable that I didn't even realize we were walking as far as we did. We eventually got back home around 8 pm and I went up to my room for the night.
