After giving in and trusting the natural functioning of the body, I regained some sense of normality, and was able to appreciate the brain aspect of awareness as a dual form of awareness (although I am still a bit confused about some of the details as to how outer reality maps into inner reality). I spent some time getting more comfortable with this new way of experiencing part of my body (and mind). I realized how I don't really know how to operate my whole body, and I am just learning how, like an infant. I experienced myself as biomorphic protoplasm, an organized aggregate that has organs that extend into the world of 'mind' as well as the world of 'body.' Just as the skin protects the body from physical invaders, there is also a membrane that separates Self and Other in the realm of mind. It is the job of self-aware consciousness to stitch together these two membranes (the physical membrane includes the eyes and ears) -- this stitching is the re-creation of the perceived universe.
