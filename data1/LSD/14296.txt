As I looked out the window at the snow on the ground, I felt that I noticed detail in things that I would never see in a state of normalcy.  The window itself took on new meaning as I thought about the molecular structure, the density of it's matter, and the relative permanence of it's structure so long as nothing busted through it.  A tiny crack in the window was particularly interesting, and seemed to represent imperfection, and I began to wonder about the meaning of this revelation.  I have considered myself a Christian since my early teens, but have since begun to question the accuracy, intention, and understanding of the biblical authors.  The trip helped me to more fully understand the infinite nature of God, and though I may never know the full extent, this was a glimpse beyond my previous understanding.  I felt a personal connection to divine forces that some may never even dream of (why on earth is this even frowned upon?).  My personal view of God is that, yes it exists, and is everything, but may be in a process of purifying itself through humanity.  I could go on, but it may not be worth pondering such deep topics until next trip (or after life?).
