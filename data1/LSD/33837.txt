So, I go down and there's my landlord and I say 'Hi there, nice day isn't it?' and he gives me this little elderly grin and a nod and says 'Oh yeah, 80 degrees, perfect day.' Very, very prophetic words, I felt. We both looked up into the sky, admiring the day. It was a moment. So, anyways, there I was talking to the landlord tripping balls on acid and I realized I was still holding the cordless phone from when I was trying to page my friend, which must have made me look weird. I then walked out to the front of my apartments (it is a gated apartment complex with one entrance in the front) and I went outside the gate (another violation of my plan to not leave my apartment, an unwise move) and I went and sat down on the steps in the front and just was checking out the trees and plants and stuff. I tried to go back in and realized I had Forgotten My Key! D'oh! I was locked out. I tried to go around but, being as it was a gated community, there was no way inside. I tried to get the attention of the landlord but he had left the courtyard. I saw a guy walk past me on the sidewalk and he looked sinister...I thought he was evil for some reason, but didn't really feel threatened by him, I just got bad vibes. He looked at me oddly and I just said hello and gave what, to him, must have been a weird looking smile. I was still holding the cordless phone, I noticed, so I put it in my pocket (I have big pockets.)
