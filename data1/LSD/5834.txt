I felt destroyed. I knew in my mind that this was the end. At this point they had also called an ambulance to my house, as well as backup police officers. My entire culdesac was filled with law enforcement. Since I was freaking out even more now, the police officer led me over to the ambulance so that the medical examiner could check me out. He said I would be fine, and that I just had a really high pulse. Some of the police officers were enjoying themselves, and fucking around with me at the time. I remember one officer telling me to go to another officer, then when I got there he would say 'What are you doing here? I told you to go over there!' One of the officers who was talking to my friends inside of my house, was talking about all the crazy things all my friends were saying, and how they were definitely 'gone'. Eventually, one of the officers led me back to my front porch, to help me get my shoes. I put them on, then I was put in the back of a police car. I felt two inches tall again. I began to feel very claustrophobic, and started freaking out again.I kept looking out the window, and eventually they let me out again for awhile.
