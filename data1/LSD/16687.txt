After about a mile of hiking we reached a fast moving river which we had to ford.  I was cold and waist deep and we had to lean sideways to not be swept away, carrying our belongings above our waists.  Jessica and I were tripping very hard and this was quite an endeavor.  At the end of the ford I payed our guide, whose name was Rennick, then gave my other 2 companions their mushrooms before walking a little farther and finally arriving at the springs.
