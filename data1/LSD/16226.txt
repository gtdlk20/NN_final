7:30 AM.  The hallucinations slowed to a stop.  I had not gotten a wink of sleep, though I felt mildly refreshed when the sun rose.  J got up too and kept me company as we talked about the night, used the computer and relaxed.  I drove out for some McDonalds with most of the guys.  Though I hadn't eaten in over 18 hours, I still couldn't finish the meal.  I got home and still could not sleep immediately.  I was awake for most of the day, probably because I was excited about the whole experience.  I had mild HPPD in the following days.  Nothing serious, just small reminders that said, 'Hey, don't forget, you did LSD not too long ago.'
