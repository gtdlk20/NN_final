T=6:00: I cleaned up a bit, drank a lot more water.  Occasional visual trails but they were receding.  I could remember the passwords to my devices again.  (Perhaps those had been the 'cryptographic keys' I imagined during the virtual interrogation scene; I had noticed at the time that I was unable to log into my devices and perhaps had mentally recast it as being willfully refusing to do so.  I was reminded of 'bicycle day' and how Albert Hofmann had thought that he was going mad on LSD and perceived his neighbor as a malevolent and persecuting witch.)  Occasional imagined alternate experiences and realities but they felt more controlled.  Before, they had felt entirely involuntary, like my conscious perceptions being forcibly re-initialized in another body or another time.  Now they were more faded, felt more like my imagination.  It was like the difference between a lucid dream and a directed visualization-- less comprehensive and realistic-seeming, but also much more controlled.
