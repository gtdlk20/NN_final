After about 2 more hours we were just talking and out of the blue a pair of red small lights look at me. I looked back... All I could see was a shadow behind Rob's shoulder with red piercing eyes. I was dumbfounded I couldnt move talk or blink I could only stare. It moved side to side as if it was going to take Rob alive. As soon as he got close to Rob I guess Rob went to reach for something on the table and the shadow collapsed right before my eyes. If you have seen paranormal activity 3 then its the part were the ghost uses the bed sheets and it looks like a person but then the sheet collapses on its own into nothing... Same thing happened. I was in complete shock and my eyes were tearing. I didnt tell my friends about it for some reason. I was compelled not to like if I told them what I had saw I would be releasing a bigger burden onto them so I kept it to my self. After our peek went down enough to look publicly non-intoxicated we went to Jack  in the box and talked.
