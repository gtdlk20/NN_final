All in all, I tripped for approximately 9 hours. I have a crystal clear memory of everything that went on, although I imagine that I will be piecing together my memory of my thoughts for the rest of this life. As closely as I can calculate I walked 25 miles that night, the soles of my shoes are almost completely flat. For approximately 2 hours I exhibited the sensory input and thought patterns of a paranoid psychotic. At no time during the trip did I lose control of what I was doing, the fight was to control my thoughts. The trip was at no time bad or good, it just was. I spent every moment after I left that room in emergency mode, thinking only of what I needed to do to be as safe as I could.
