For a while I have harboured the ambition of taking LSD in my own home, a 15 acre property surrounded by lush forest and a large dam. I currently still live with my parents, so this wasn't possible until I explained my reasons to them, having taken mushrooms and smoked pot themselves they understood and it seemed they were even intrigued as to what experiences I might have.
