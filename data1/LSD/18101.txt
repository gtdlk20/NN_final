By this stage I couldnt remember taking LSD and my mind was starting to play all sorts of tricks on me, I couldnt get a grip on what was real and what was fake. I started to doubt everything..even my best mate. I couldnt accept that it was all real, my mind was spinning and everything was moving in a fowards directions and everything looked digital, it all looked very smooth and fake. My perception of my best friend was a little man standing up inside my mind, he wasnt real and he was trying to trick me into things by telling me that we were only tripping on LSD, I couldnt believe him. I thought he was in my imagination and he wasnt real by of course he was. I was trying to fight against my mind so hard it was making me crazy. Everything felt as if it was a big mind game in my head, it felt as if I was not inside my body but I was a spirit flying around fighting inside my head and everything around me wasnt real, it wasnt there.
