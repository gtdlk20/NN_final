I came to the conclusion that the real importance of a life is whom one chooses to spend their life with and with what dynamic they interact. I am exceedingly grateful to have been able to share almost a quarter of my life (and certainly the majority of my adulthood) with someone so strong, caring and graceful as my ex, and while I miss her I know what would happen if we gave it another shot. I cried for the loss (albeit due to my own decision and action) of someone who was so important to me, but ultimately am glad that we may be able to still be good friends and hopefully spend some time together now and then.
