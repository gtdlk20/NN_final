I'm pretty sure we all decided to venture outside for a while.  The girls needed something out of their car.  Now remember how trip-tastic this complex is.  The colors on the builings were moving, the lights threw shadows that moved, the air tasted great, the sky, moon, and clouds were incredible.  I felt euphoric.  We were tripping pretty good at this point and our conversations seemed to be looping.  I remember S running up to where all the electric meters, boxes, etc.. for our building and screaming 'I can control the world from here!'  We laugh our asses off, walk around, get strange looks and eventually remember what we came outside for.  High spirits for all.
