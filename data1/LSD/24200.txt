I am far enough away from that experience now that I think I have a pretty good handle on what happened and why. At first, it was sort of like surviving a violent hurricane, then climbing a nearbye mountain and looking down upon the wreckage to better assess the damage. Now the view of the landscape looks even better than it did before the hurricane, though there are still some areas which remain under construction.
