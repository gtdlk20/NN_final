I got home and just took a shower after I had this convo with my mom...she didn't care too much that I was on acid bc I had good grade in school and am mostly mature (she might have thought that I had only ate a pot brownie) The shower was amazing and there were patterns all over the tiles and my dad was playing the drums downstairs and so that was cool. After I got out of the shower I walked out of the bathroom to find my sister, her friend, my mom, and my moms friend talking them not even knowing I'm on acid tripping hard. I danced around my room for a little bit and had so many thoughts flowing thinking about life.
