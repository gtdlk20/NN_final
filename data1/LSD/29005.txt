As an age seasoned partier, I often think back to my 20s when acid tripping was a common weekend activity. Often yearning for those happy days. Now my life was work and care filled for my dear wife and other commitments. When an old friend mentioned he scored some blotter, I could not resist a trip after nearly 2 decades of sobriety. My wife was gone for a weekend on a business trip so I went for it.
