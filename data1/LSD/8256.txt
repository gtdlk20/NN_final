T+4.00-	There are sirens that get closer and closer and eventually stop right outside. I realise now that must have been an ambulance for that drunk dude earlier but at the time I was convinced we were gonna get busted and so I gathered all the drugs in the room (of which there were many) and forced S (on her first trip) to stash them all in her bra. I then took all my possessions (Phone, iPod, wallet, house keys etc) and put them down on the bed stating I dont want to have anything on me anyone can rob me for. Im panicking, Ive started talking too loudly, shouting and screaming basically. The hallucinations are very intense; everything is moving, crawling, breathing auditory too music sounds like its coming out of strange places strange noises everywhere. But were making too much noise and have been here far too long, so we decide to take to the streets, T, S and I. This is when I think I went into my bad trip, because before leaving my friends flat, I started having very bad electric zaps (paresthesia) that paralyzed my body and speech, and from now on I slip in and out of moments of lucidity, but mostly am stuck behind my hallucinations, seeing nothing but the horrifying imaginings of my mind.
