The following days I experienced an afterglow effect of feeling more connected with the environment and the people I hang out with. The bond I share with my boyfriend also strengthened. For now, I am looking forward to form more psychedelic memories and try to make them as beautiful as this was for me and my significant other, not rushing to the next trip though.
