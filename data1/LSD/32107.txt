A glorious change came over me in the following two or three days, in which I was highly aware of my surroundings, as if they were new.  This was accompanied by a new state of relaxed movement without any sign of fatigue, reminiscent of the ease in which a lion or leopard walks, confident in ability.   More LSD trials produced the same stages of LSD effect and I reached unaccustomed levels of ability in sports activities.  This blissful state would not occur unless I fully participated in the muscular work during each session.
