There they put me on anti-psychotics and I was sent home after a few days of being in a psych ward for one day and a detox center for drug addicts the other few days. There visuals were still present at first, often being outlines of Buddha or some other figure meditating. After about a day or two in the detox center, the visuals began to subside and I calmed down, yet I felt some level of inner peace and calm I had never felt before, although nowhere near the level that I felt on day four, more than I had felt in many years.
