It was only about an hour into the trip and I hadn't even peaked. At the peak of the trip, I experienced full blown ego death. What resulted were ultimate feelings of rising up into a state of pure bliss. I felt connected to the infinite now. This exceeded and went deeper than any of my previous LSD experiences. Further amusing by the fact that I wasn't even on a heroic dose of the substance.
