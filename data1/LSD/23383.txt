After that things started to settle back down, but neither me or Nick could sleep that night.  The eye twitch continued until the next evening, and the intense trip made me stay away from acid for a while.  It was not a bad experience, don't get me wrong, it was probably the most fun thing I have ever done, but the crash afterward was just a little too much and I had to step back and recover.  There is a lot more that I could tell you, but I don't remember the sequence much and I am tired of writing so I hope you have enjoyed my story.
