Anyway, it was just interesting, how under a stressful and prolonged experience where being sober was preferable, I suddenly felt totally sober and was able to act completely normally.  I even did stuff like, in the car, stare at things to see if I got the normal fractals... nothing.  Once I was alone, I felt like I was high and there was no way I could be sober. I didn't want to be high, I just wanted to be sober.
