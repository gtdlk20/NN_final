I eventually stopped doing things subconsciously, and the delusions changed into the realization of the magnitude of what had just happened.  The harsh realization that I had run around and exposed myself while on high doses of LSD had just dawned on me.  My delusions of grandeur became fallacies, and I immediately felt ashamed for my obnoxious behavior.  Although I was still tripping very hard and getting intense visuals (my hallucinations were both auditory and visual, very colorful and happy), I was able to control my actions.
