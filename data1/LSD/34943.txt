Another amazing thing was that I could not tie my shoes. I knew how to tie them. I was physically able to. I wanted to. I had the willpower, but something was missing. This was so interesting cause it made me consider that there may be many more parts of our brain involved in even mundane tasks that we are not aware of. And I only became aware of one of these parts when it was turned off. I heard there can be much worse side effects, but fortunately the only side effect I had was feeling extremely stuffy. Thankfully we had a bucket of water right by our side, but it mentally felt like I was covered in way to many blankets. That is not a metaphor. It was the physical equivalent of that, but in my brain. But other than that small discomfort, it was pretty fun.
