We then went back up stairs for a smoke. I had discovered on the pervious trip, that while on LSD I enjoyed to draw with a pen a paper. So I began, I could fell every movement of the pen as it glided over the page, and did some really nice and highly creative stuff.  Again in retrospect LSD unlocked in me the ability to draw and not only when IÂ’m on it, so I recommend that everyone give it a go. I did this for about 1 hour, stopping some times to chat to the others and laugh at things, and sometimes even trying to communicate the incomprehensible joy that is LSD, finding that a knowing glance is all it takes. This was one of the most pleasant and relaxing times in my life.
