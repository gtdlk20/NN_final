Around 10:20 we get to Zee's house because that's where we thought we were staying for the night. We all stood out in the driveway while Ally and I were tripping and we all had a cigarette. Ally isn't saying much, but I sure as hell am. B grew up in a bad part of town and is pretty ghetto. I start yammering on about how he's a white trash piece of shit, and that I'm going to kick his ass. B is a guy you don't want to say this shit to. He realizes that I'm just tripping and he doesn't get too pissed off. By they way I don't mean anything of what I'm saying to B even when I was saying it. I just say stuff like that to get a rise out of my friends and that night was feeling good about myself.
