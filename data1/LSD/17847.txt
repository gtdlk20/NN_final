It was soon after this we finally realized the cat was in-fact in the room with us. JoJo is a great cat but he can be hella stubborn sometimes and hard to get out of a room. And as it was the middle of the night, as cats do, he can get into this mood and start acting restless and crazy. Now when youre tripping balls and youre around a kitty that can be aggressive sometimes and/or extra playful/stubborn, that can lead to bad thoughts which at this point in your trip nearing and/or at the peak, can have drastic ramifications for your state of mind. This is what happened to Summer.
