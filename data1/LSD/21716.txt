Soon after we got back, everything changed.  Mainly, I began to feel nauseous, and I was hungry too, but there wasn't a hope in hell that I could even comtemplate eating anything.  I went to the bathroom and sat down on the toilet and was horrified to see that my manhood had shrunk to about one inch!!!  After that shock, I was very anxious to rid myself of the general feeling of malaise.  Someone had told us that orange juice is an antidote to acid, so I forced myself to drink a small glass of it... it had no effect.  (I've since read that it's also meant to enhance the trip, so I don't know what's true).
