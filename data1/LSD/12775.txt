I had to go to the bathroom again, and went upstairs.  I told myself that I couldn't look in the mirror, knowing I could get stuck looking at myself.  I washed my hands, avoiding myself in the mirror, but when I looked up to grab a paper towel I saw my cheeks move, kind of fluttering or twitching.  I stared, trying to figure out what I'd seen and so I smiled at myself, and watched in awe as my cheeks moved abnormally fast and kind of shuddered. I began to stare at myself, and watched myself become cartoon-like.  I was completely 2-dimensional for a while, then I suddenly realized that I was watching myself, and I was the mirror. I could see the real me through the mirror, but I was separated from myself.  I don't know how long I watched myself, before realizing that Delyriem was probably worried about me.  I walked back downstairs and Delyriem was at the door waiting for me, alarmed at how long I'd taken.  I told him I got stuck in the mirror, trying to explain what I'd seen.
