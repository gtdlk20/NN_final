Now this got to a point where my mind could no longer stand the pure terror I was going threw, all of a sudden my mind was sucked out of the joke and I could watch it from a distance. It was total blackness except for something that looked like one of those 'shoe box managers' or little set ups you had to build in grade school, but each side of the box had a different part of the joke in it. I watched this for a few minutes until I lost all idea of where I was, it was like I fell out of the joke and stayed there, outside, watching it for a few minutes, then I fell.
