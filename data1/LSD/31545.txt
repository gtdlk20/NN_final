When we finally got to Marys neighborhood it was like driving in fairy tale land. All white houses with white picket fences. We pulled into a long driveway and kind of got lost there. We went back and forth. When I realized I was tripping out too hard to back up, we looked for a place in this driveway to turn around. Mind you its past 2:30am in some neighborhood we barely know. We thought there was a field to the right I could turn my truck into, but it looked like it dropped off into a cliff. When neither of them would get out to check, I put on the brake and went and petted the grass to make sure it was level. It was, so I proceeded to go through and turn around.
