T=3:55: I went to get more water.  I then felt a bit hot and nauseous again so I laid back down on the cool tile floor.  I began being mentally reincarnated as increasingly strange alien forms -- radially symmetric things, undersea things, liquid things, gaseous things, abstract things, mechanical things.  Always this mantra 'all my best trips were on LSD' and the sense of a recursive nature to the closed-eye visuals and the trip itself.
