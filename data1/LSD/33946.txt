As I got up to turn on the lights Kid A screamed, 'NO! That is a BAD idea!'. And suddenly I saw the incredible error that I was about to make and the horror that would be brought upon us. I inherently knew that if I were to turn on the lights the whole world surrounding me would dissolve into a primordial ooze. It would be lost and all that would remain would be a clear light with my soul being lost within its power forever. I knew that all would be lost, and I would be alone. I felt that LSD had created a cosmic hole in my head, and the entire universe would be sucked into it leaving me completely alone.
