I am an old head. I have not taken large volumes of LSD, as it's potency seems to revolve around your potency. It is the only drug that is impossible to abuse. Respected, it can be dreadfully strong. It operates on your system primarily as a sensory amplifier, when potent, to the point of distortion.
