Disclaimer: This is not a how-to guide. I do not feel that I have found enlightenment. I feel like I had a spiritual awakening, but I am young and many challenges await me. What I experienced is possible for everyone if they are willing to work for it, but only the individual can determine the path they need to take for spiritual growth, which includes whatever it is to be done to get to the here, there, and everywhere. For some it may take months to get to this point, for other years. I hope that this can inspire others to take a much safer and stable path to arrive at that constant state of becoming.
