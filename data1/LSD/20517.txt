These angular spikes which were all very warm shadowy colors red, dark yellow, orange turned into or pulled back into some kind of peacock looking machine creature that was intensely black and gold and seemed robotic and electric. It was (I dont want to say traveling) but existing? Floating or passing by in some kind of other void or dimension.  Maybe a void-like dimension? I dont know.  It was one of the most distinct visuals I had ever seen on a psychedelic with my eyes shut and visually it was impressive but the feelings attached to it were way more awesome is all I can say. Words dont do justice for anything Im describing'. Everything this night was so exaggerated and so much crazier, spiritual, hyperreal and vivid than I could ever put into words. Everything was way more over the top and intense and psychedelic than it sounds here or on paper believe me.
