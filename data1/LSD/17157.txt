A) The song I heard in my head that night was actually very good.  Four bar melody, almost Trip-Hop in style with an industrial beat.  Any musicians reading this will understand my wonder at this:  The song is COMPLETELY unlike anything else I have written.  I am a heavy metal musician, and most my stuff is 8 bar riffs with aggressive feels to it.  The song I wrote that night is WORLDS apart from anything else I have ever written.
