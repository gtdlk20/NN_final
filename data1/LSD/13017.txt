Oh I keep being super not scientific about this. Like the whole reason why I wanna document thingsI just keep ignoring the things that I would want to write down, like what the actual visual effects are, and what Im avoiding when Im not writing. All the colors. Just, every color. Especially the like, uh, the acid ones. [laughs] derp. You know the neon, whatever. All that. Is just happening. But when I focus really hard, like on writing for example, cause like right now Im just letting my eyes do whatever the fuck they want. Which isI dont even wanna knowwhat itll look like. Just, its all over the place. Ohhhh no.the creature is up. Its fine. He just goes..you knownature is callingI can assume [crashing noises] Fucking christ, some things never change. Ok. The colors. Thats what Im avoiding. It sounds really nice. Thats the thingall the physical sensations, all the visual sensations, are things that should not be pleasant but are. Thats the crazy thing. And the only thing thats unpleasant is resisting it. Let the vibrations happen and it just feels really good. But like you try to hold still so you can sense them, and everything starts to go all like, putrid, and the colors, instead of being this like harmonious rainbow fractal awesomeness is like bruises and sickness and like vomit. Its really gross and you want it to just not be happening anymore and its super easy to make it not be happening anymore. All you have to do is relax and stop resisting. Time is a little bit different, which is what I expected, which is why I set alarms for myself so that I could document properly. Im just a step ahead of myself the whole time. Anyways, feels like its been like 3 hours and its been 3 minutes and thats just the nature of this, I suppose. Ill stop.
