At about 9:30 AM, Maria came back. I dont really know much about her, but she seemed nice as she requested me to sleep on the couch, which I was more than happy to do. I had a horrible headache, so I was excited to continue my resting phase. When I got up, I could tell Id definitely come down, and there were no more visuals or intense feelings, but the world still didnt make much sense. There was something just off about the world, at that moment.
