4am: The trip is slowly starting to decrease. My mind is coming back to my body, as I am piecing together myself in my room and I can now figure out who I am. I'm collecting all my thoughts as if all my years of learning are being crammed into my mind in a 30 minute period. I am relearning everything as if I was just reborn. I'm completely drugged, I've had enough depressants and sleep medicine to tranquilize a horse, but I'm still awake, yet I can feel the depressant in it's entirety. I get up to go to the bathroom because I haven't peed in several hours. I avoid looking into the mirror because I know that I will get lost in it. As I turn around after I'm done peeing, I catch a glimpse of the mirror. I try as hard as I can not too, but I end up staring at it. I don't know what its called, but I'm seeing one of those infinity type images. I can see myself hundreds of times like I'm looking through a tunnel and I can see the frame of the mirror multiple times as well. This is a complete mind trip so I stop staring a return to my bed. Every time I touch my sheets, instead of feeling a fabric my fingertips can feel each and every single thread. I can distinguishable feel the texture of the thread.
