Now, let me just say, up till this point the trip wasn't especially strong. Sure, we were fucked, high as kites, in a terrible state, but neither of us were tripping out yet, things were just a little crazy. That changed as soon as we hit the fresh air. My memory is a little flaky of the journey between pubs (maybe a ten minute walk). I can remember cars screaming past at an astounding speed and volume, my legs kept stretching and shrinking as I walked, my friend's faces took on dark and menacing overtones. I became a little paranoid, a little wigged out. This wasn't helped by the other guy on acid climbing on cars and bus shelters, removing his clothes, screaming his face off and at one point dry humping a church. Yup, he humped a church. He's going straight to hell. Nonetheless, I was holding it together fine and kept it in my mind that I would soon be sitting in my favourite drinking establishment, nursing a beer.
