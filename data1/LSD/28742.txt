We had only brought 4 or 5 bottles of water, and were sorely unprepared for how dehydrated we would become.  I hated checking the time, because I had no concept of time, so I really couldnÂ’t understand how if it seemed as if I checked my phone every 10 minutes, but the time never changed.  This was really disturbing for me because I am usually a very time-conscious person.
