We began to make love, which has never, before or since, for me OR her been either more intense, more euphoric, or more amazing.  Afterwards we held each other very closely, and talked about how we BOTH had NEVER felt so happy or so 'high' or 'ultimate' in our lives.  Right when I was about to say it, she told me that it was the best experience of her life, and if she had died tomorrow, she would do so having a life that she'd never trade for anything in the world because of this experience.  I'll never forget the words.
