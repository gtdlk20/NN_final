Finally, daylight was coming about. We had spent the entire night in her boyfriends room. We laid in his bed and opened the window and watched the sky as it turned into a dull gray. We also watched her boyfriend and all his friends come out into the living room and talk as if we were not there. It was as if my friend and I were watching a television show. We were invisible. It was all so strange. She put on a Dave Matthews CD (Some Devil) and we stared at a painting by Van Gogh. We realized that the painter doesnt even have a clue was he is about to do. It is just the miracle of the paint brush and every second it touches the canvas.
