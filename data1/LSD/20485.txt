Eventually we stop staring at the water and the orange light reflecting off it and trek on into the canyon which is pretty much across the street but the trail we want to take is a little more up the hill. As were walking were joking about how the best way to spot people who are tripping on psychedelics is to notice the people walking around in the middle of the night like its daytime and attempting to do daytime activities at some ungodly hour in the night. This seems to be a theme for psychedelics. It just felt like daytime almost at how well we could see things but it was still dark so its hard to describe. Our attitudes were very awake and happy so thats probably also why. I mean we werent super happy or ecstatic really because the trip was changing gears and it wasnt getting any less serious but we also had energy and other feelings.
