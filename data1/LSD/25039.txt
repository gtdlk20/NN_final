Also I had a sense of knowing that the body likes to work, it likes to be touched, skin is your biggest organ and it likes to move. It's the mind that can keep it from doing so. I felt very comfortable, relaxed and beautiful throughout the whole session. I realized many things. After the massage I went to my piano and played for awhile. I could feel the vibration of the notes in different parts of my body, some parts ached while I played, so I did some yoga to strech myself out.
