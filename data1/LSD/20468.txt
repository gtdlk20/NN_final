We werent even talking that loud... we were kind of getting bothered by both of them me and my tripping friend..but it was a house we could be at and trip at so we couldnt be picky. And when he yelled at us it didnt go back to awkward silence or anything everything just continued how it was. And we change the channel because that shit was too fucked up and we eventually land on Family Guy and I remember when we landed on it it was just one joke then commercial, like the end of one joke and then it went straight to commercial and I remember it was the stupidest most unfunny Family Guy joke Id ever seen and my tripping friend was just like That was stupid and my Russian friend right there at the edge of the room was like SHUT UP! and his mom kept telling him in Russian to tell us to shut up and we werent even talking loud at all.
