This, in turn, prompted me to think of acid as a little lens that zoomed into my feelings regarding everything. The intensity of emotions I felt was incredibly amplified, and I mean, I dont consider myself as particularly apathetic on a daily basis, but Im not very in tune with what I feel either. As I kept peeling scrapes of paint off of my belly, I was trying to identify how I felt - but I felt so much. At the same time. And I couldnt break it apart, no matter how much I tried, all I could do was just sit there and feel it, soaking it all in, like a little sponge.
