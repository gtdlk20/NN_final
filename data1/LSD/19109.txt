Although I went on a night walk to help ease my nerves, I vomited profusely a couple of times.  It was embarrassing, as I'm sure some neighbors heard it. My dad had Neil Young playing on his outdoor speakers and I SWEAR I was able to hear clearly defined music for at least half a mile, despite other noises of summer nights in the country like crickets or neighborhood bonfires.  I thought that was an amazing feature, and I rode on that for the rest of the trip. On my walk, I was able to keep it cool when cars went by, even though the headlights were exceptionally bright.  Lights from homes which shone onto the road looked distorted in a way that is hard to describe: almost sideways, and curved.  My peripheral vision seemed cloudy and bent in a strange, almost flashing way.  To elaborate, the light in my peripheral vision seemed to flash, but I knew this was only an effect from the acid.  Regardless, it actually kept spooking me a bit and keeping me on my nerves. Whenever I smoked a cigarette, I knew I only took one or two drags, but my cigarette LOOKED finished. IT WAS SO WEIRD, and one of the funniest/strangest effects I ever had off a drug. I am going to assume that is from how fucked up my vision was. I wonder if anyone else had that experience.
