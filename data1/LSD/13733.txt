I have been to this park a million times in my life...and it has never presented to me as being as VAST as it was tonight.  The area of expanse was overwhelming to me, I could not comprehend how vast a space this was.  I was compelled to discuss this with my companions, but they were totally enthralled with a stand of weeping willow trees that, on first glance seemed to have the appearance of a fountain, with the branches extending upward slightly, then spilling down to the ground.  At this point I'm thinking (saying?) 'this is gonna be fun tonight!'  We're about 3 hrs into it now.
