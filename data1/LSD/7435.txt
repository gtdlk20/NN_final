I wasnt sure how I felt about leaving. Part of me was ready to go home, but part of me definitely wasnt. I didnt want to re-enter civilization. I wanted to spend the rest of the trip and the rest of my life in the wilderness. I didnt want to re-enter civilization. I wanted to spend the rest of the trip and the rest of my life in the wilderness. I realized the struggle that implied and the hypocrisy of driving in a truck made from materials in a factory while decrying societys faults. The drive back took a little over an hour. I got a definite sense that I was finally starting to come down. I had my first glimpse of my own sane mind in hours. I got a call from a couple of friends on the East Coast wishing me a happy birthday. My friend decided to pull over and pick up a hitchhiker on the highway, who hopped in the bed of the truck for the rest of the drive.
