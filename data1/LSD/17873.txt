After maybe an hour or two longer, we were beginning to come down from the big peak and starting to go down the backside. The subsequent peaks getting less and less intense. During this phase it felt as if we were gaining a sense of perspective back. For example while at the peak it felt like we were losing a sense of perspective or a sense of self, and coming down from that huge peak were slowly gaining perspective back, settling back into a sense of I or me rather than him/her or even more indistinct pronouns (if youre even using pronouns). We both were able to get our brains back in a lil bit of order again, at least to the point where we both agreed there were no more existential crises that were going to happen or intense hallucinations and ended up getting intimate and it ended up being really really fun! Wasnt able to quite cum this time, as its still really hard to stay focused long enough, my brain was still going a million miles a minute and every single stimulus was a possible distraction from what my partner was doing. But just gotta say Summer has a very very talented tongue and my sense of feeling her touch and tongue was exquisite. A++++ for effort, would have sex on the floor again.
