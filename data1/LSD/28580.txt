While I was walking trying to find a phone to call a cab. My thoughts went into overdrive. All thoughts were of great meaning all of them having an idea. About 40,000 sub thoughts would branch off one giving me an insight into something which lead to another thing and so on and so on.... The brain is a powerful tool which I think we have not yet mastered, Lsd showed me that night.
