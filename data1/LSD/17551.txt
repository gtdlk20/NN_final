About at 1:15 i dropped the other cube, knowing that it wouldnt work.  My pupils became a little larger than before, and then i thought maybe it would work.  My stomach started to feel a little wierd, and my friend on the phone told me it would work.  Well i stayed up till 5 in the morning and not a damn thing happened.  I was pissed because my friends said they took 2 cubes from the same batch and they tripped nuts.  Nothing happened again for me.  I will try acid again, i will probably keep trying it until i realize that I am either 1.) psychologically immune to it (i dont know how) or 2.) that Acid is real, it's just hard as hell to find some that works, or 3.) Acid isn't real, and I should just stick to smokin pot and looking for mushrooms.  If anyone else has this problem, please post it because i dont think i am alone here.
