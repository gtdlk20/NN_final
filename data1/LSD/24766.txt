I believed that everyone was playing a trick on me. I was displeased about it (I was rather disconnected from emotion at this point.) and decided to walk down the street in the direction I guessed was home. I had never had problems deciphering reality from hallucination while dreaming of LSD and chose to stick to my guns. I began walking down the street in the direction I guessed was home but then walked back, deciding that I was not going to let anyone trick me into getting myself arrested on the long walk back to the town my car was in. I sat on the porch waiting for them to come outside and end the game. I began to wonder if I wasn't passed out somewhere and all this going on inside my head. (Another bright idea.) A short time after, my friends going back to the town my car was in came out of the house. Too short I thought..
