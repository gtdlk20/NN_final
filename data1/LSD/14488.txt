Then I went to the sink to wash my hands and saw a glorious light show. The water splashing about on the stainless steel sink made a rainbow of colors only seen in space. I had never seen anything so beautiful and vibrant. I had always been a sucker for pretty colors, but this rendered me utterly speechless. I ate my breadsticks with a huge grin on my face, replaying the beautiful colors along with my friendÂ’s gorgeous smile in my head and felt a satisfaction like I had never felt before. It felt like there had been something missing, an empty part of myself that had been filled by these images and the warm breadsticks. I was extremely thirsty and decided I would go out into the dining room to get a drink and take a look around at all the kids and families laughing and playing.
