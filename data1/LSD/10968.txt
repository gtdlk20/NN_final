Now I was alone in my room, and the Sound Tribe was starting to sound a bit too repetitive and 'electronic' for me. So I switched to The Breakfast, starting at the first track of one of my favorite live shows. Ahh, much better. I closed my eyes to check out the CEVs, because 15 minutes ago there had been none, and I was amazed by the beautiful waves of technicolor which flowed around in infinite 3D space behind my eyelids. As each psychedelic wave washed over me I felt a feeling of peace that I have only experienced a handful of times on LSD.
