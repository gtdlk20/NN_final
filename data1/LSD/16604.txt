I've done LSD several times over the course of the last year, I would estimate twelve times total (I had not used it prior to this period of time).  I'm in my early 20s.  I would say my experiences prior to this trip had been fairly typical.  I have a reliable supply of strong enough stuff, and I generally take two hits.  The most I have ever taken was four hits, though of course dosage varies.
