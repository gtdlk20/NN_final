The acid was really starting to kick in, I was getting black flashes much like a strobe light, and I was feeling quite euphoric.  We decided to go out into the back yard.  My other two friends were laughing at us as we got accustomed to our new acid world.  I found it very difficult to walk, and my perceptions were getting altered, when I tried to move a limb it was extremely exaggerated.  For example, I remember once I was holding a cigarette, and moved my arm to take a drag.  I could not judge how much I was moving my arm and I swung the cig into the air and it fell on the ground next to me.  When I reached down to pick it up, my hand slammed into the ground.  This 'transitory stage' only lasted about 10 minutes (I think).  However the exageration of everything lasted throughout the night.
