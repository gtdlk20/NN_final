At 5:00 PM I was feeling pretty stoned. I had noticeable shakes and the walls started breathing around me. I also felt like I was in the best mood of my life. We put in some music and it hit me like a ton of bricks. Time started crawling at an incredibly slow pace. I snuggled up to John and relaxed. My mind started to float away. I was enjoying this non-thought and the feeling of John's body next to me was the most wonderful feeling in the world. I tried to play the piano and the sound of it was strange and new. I was still able to play when I wasn't thinking, but when I concentrated the music just slowed to a halt. We had a hard time finding CDs to play because they either had skips or they just stopped in mid-song. Then I realized that I didn't quite know what I was, where I was, who I was, what we were doing. The only thing that I knew was that I was in a living room, assumed to be MY living room. As for the rest of the universe, it wasn't there. All there was was that room and the only other person who existed was John. My ability to communicate was shot, and everything we tried to say to each other echoed in my mind until it made no sense, while at the same time it made more sense than anything has ever made sense. Every attempt at conversation left me laughing. I was smiling so much my lips started to tremble from the effort. I watched the curtains in the living room flow like liquid into itself. Bright and neon green. The walls around me towered to a point where I felt like I was only a foot tall.
