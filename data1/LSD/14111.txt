T=19:00: I went out to my kitchen, drank some vegetable juice.  Normally I hate vegetable juice.  For some reason, it seemed to me rather arbitrary now whether people should drink fruit juice or vegetable juice or something else entirely, so I finished most of it.  Then I decided that it still tasted a bit disagreeable and threw the last quarter away.  Perhaps I was settling back into myself again.  Into this particular possible reality.  I had some cold pizza.  I've always liked cold pizza.
