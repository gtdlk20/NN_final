As my watch passed eight(T+01:00), the sun was descending and so was my ability to commit to rationality. I felt as though someone was tugging at a string that ran down through the top of my head, and that was all there was to keep me on two feet. My body was vaguely responsive to my commands, but all the while I felt as though there were energy waves moving through me, dictating my motions. Tired of spinning and curious to explore my now less-familiar apartment, I threw LTJ Bukem into the player and slunk away to my bedroom.
