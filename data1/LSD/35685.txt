It was A gloomy October 31st...yes it was all hallows eve. Me and my friend who will be called J set out on A journey. Our minds clear and deep we purchased some acid. Everything started at 5:00 Pm darkness had just sat in, we are in my apartment we comsume the blotter pieces at 5:30. 45 minuites later my body felt light and I sat up to shake it off. After this time had passed I felt like I have never taken a drug before. My friend J was also feeling the same effects. We decided to go out and walk the town as soon as I set foot outside I suddenly became strangely inebriated. The external world became changed as in a dream. Objects appeared to gain inrelief; they assumed unusual dimensions; and colors became more glowing. Even self-perception and the sense of time were changed. When the eyes were closed, colored pictures flashed past in a quickly changing kaleidoscope. After a few hours, the not unpleasant inebriation, which had been experienced whilst I was fully conscious, disappeared. I came back to reality for a moment and relized there were two cops talking to me saying son what have you injested? I said Lsd; I thought to myslef he cant do anything he cant prove anything so I told my story. He took my firend and I back to our apartment and we walked in and sat and let the Lsd dive into our minds.
