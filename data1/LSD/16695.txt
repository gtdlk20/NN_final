In the morning we all sat in the sun and ate granola, trail mix and canned vegitables.  A blunt was rolled and several people smoked it in a circle, while me and a few others played guitars and hand drums.  It was a very nice day, and we left around 12:30 to head back to Flafstaff.  I didn't feel bad, but a little fried and not 100%.  I slept for 17 hours the next night and felt refreshed in the morning.  This was an incredibly positive trip, and though I took a lot of acid, it was never overwhelming and I stayed in control the entire time.
