Dianna raced back in a pair of short shorts, and I still wondered how she wasnt freezing, since we were all wearing hoodies but her. She looked down at me, and asked, with a huge grin on her face, Len, write Fuck Misogyny on my thighs! In red! I want it to look ginormous and aggressive!. I found the request hilarious, and agreed immediately. My muscles were still tense, and I felt strangely antsy (similar to the Ritalin-antsy I feel when I cruise), so the result wasnt the best. Not to mention, I accidentally misspelled Misogyny and had attempted to correct it, making the letters even more daunting and bolder-looking. Dianna was, nonetheless, very pleased with the result, as it wrapped around her back, and she had the last syllable visible only from behind. It was at that point that she said, You need some color in you! and sprinkled my hair and forehead in lavender.
