There is, of course more to the story for that day and some of the themes from the 5K would come back around, however that is for another time. Would I repeat the experience? I have to err on the side of yes. Running a 5K on LSD was certainly unique, but I couldnt quite call it unpleasant. It felt incredible to be moving at speed while tripping thats for damn sure, and having headphones with a pre-selected playlist made all the difference.
