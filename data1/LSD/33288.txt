After dancing for a while i began some sort of ego death, in which i was omnipresent in this room full of otheres who were on the same level as i was, there was no predjudice, just an unconditional brotherhood amongst these people i didnt even speak too, these people id never met, iy was perfect. I felt out of control of myself, and that we were all one in control of eah other. Ive heard of people seeing god on acid, but i felt like i was god. It was perfect.
