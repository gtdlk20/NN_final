While the day was quite amazing, I have to say that some of the after-effecs were somewhat difficult to deal with.  Once I was finally alone, I was a bit frightened of everything, just mildly, and, as is often the case I'm told, I could not sleep at all.  I was severely depressed the next day, which I am told is less typical, and have never read of in my studies, only one person I know claims to experience this after-effect, but I presume this was just my reaction to the 'normal' world after seeing things in such a beautiful light.  I have suffered from clinical depression, so this might be a factor.  (SIDE NOTE: I want it to be clear that I have not been on medication for that condition for a while and wasn't at any time near that of the trip.)
