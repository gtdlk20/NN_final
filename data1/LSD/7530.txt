When we left the woods and started back to campus, it was very apparent now that I was tripping.  My vision was really wavy and fairly heavily impaired.  I remember we stopped briefly to look out over one of the fields, and it looked like the grass was literally rippling as if it were a liquid surface.  I also had the strange sensation that we were inside a giant snow globe type structure, almost like a big biodome.
