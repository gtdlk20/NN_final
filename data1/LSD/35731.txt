Eventually we made our way to another friends house, and after a little while, everybody showed up.  We put in The Wall, and fell into a deep couch.  As soon as the first note was played, I got burst of air in my face.  I leaned over towards my friend and it seemed like the wall of the living room followed me, and I could now see through it.  Another kid walked in, who wasnÂ’t tripping, and he sat in the front.  The DVD player shorted out, and without saying anything about it we all yelled at the kid that just walked in.  He stood up and everybody started to make fun of him.  He was really just trying to fix the movie, but I thought he was trying to act like daffy duck and put on a comedy skit.
