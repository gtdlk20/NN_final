We had four hits, one for each of us that day, and two which Entheogen and our friend 'Leary' would take the next weekend.  And so, at 9AM, we put the tiny squares of paper on our tongues and prepared ourselves for the best day of our respective lives.  For a while nothing happened, and like anyone inexperienced with psychedelics, we worried nothing would EVER happen.  In a little over an hour however, as music played in the background, we both, almost simultaneously, began to feel an incredible rush of euphoria and expectation.
