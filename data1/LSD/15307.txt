Many of you have heard the announcements in the Woodstock movie warning about the brown acid. The truth is that the only problem with the brown acid is that it was so pure that it wasnt accompanied by the usual body rushes caused by speed and other adulterants in use at the time. As a result multiple doses of acid that was very strong to begin with were sometimes taken, and some trips got way out of hand.  I knowbecause I gave away a bunch of it.
