Once at the parking lot, we were in for a hilarious experience. While walking around we all managed to end up on a sheet of ice that built up on the blacktop of the parking lot. For some reason I felt like ice-skating in my sneakers, and my girlfriend began to follow my lead. She fell backwards and we all started laughing so hard. I slipped and fell to the ground from laughing and that only made everyone laugh harder. After a few minutes everyone was on the ground laughing. Eventually we all regained our balance and headed back into the dorm.
