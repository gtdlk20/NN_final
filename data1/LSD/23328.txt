T+?: My friend had bought us bubbles a few nights prior so we decided to play with them. The bubbles are incredibly beautiful and shine their colors and patters over everything. When one pops on me, I feel it all over my body. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Between the doors playing and my girlfriend and I so happy and having so much fun with everything it was just a marvelous experience. I was so relaxed and content and everything was just SO awesome. I wish I could have drawn what I saw but it was such an experience.
