As I began to scrape the hardened paint off of my chest, I realized what I just thought. I realized how immersed into my own thought process I was, and I slowed down. I rubbed my skin slowly and, frankly, it became even a little painful after a while (when I looked at the mirror, the peeled parts were all visibly sensitive-looking and reddened). It didnÂ’t matter though, because I was letting go of what covered me to reveal my true self and begin my trip - and there was no better come up. Feeling my flesh through my flesh was almost like a paradoxical surreal experience: my sense of touch was confused as to which surface was actually part of my own body, and which simply encrusted it. I gave myself warmth and protection; I suddenly felt very warm and cozy inside.
