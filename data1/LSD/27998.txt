At this point, I think I wandered back down into the ship, inside, off the open decks. The next thing I have definite memory is entering the main atrium in the ship, where there are five floors around an open center. As I was walking into the room, a man, probably 30 or so, stared into my face. In recollection, I should have told the guy to fuck off or just ignored him. He held up a camera, wanting me to take a picture of him and his family. However, and this is important, he was Italian. He didn't speak any English nor did any members of his group. I took the camera and waited for the group to essemble to be photographed. However, they just kept standing around in the circle. It gets even more complicated. I had just been walking with my discman in my hand, and now that i needed two hands to take the picture. I had to put the discman in my pocket, but I couldn't find my pockets. So, the logical thing to do at the time was to hand the Italian guy the discman. This caused confusion, he refused to take it and I shook it at him and told him to just hold it for now, which was futile since he didn't speak english. This whole event didn't take much time at all. Also, the guy had small scars on his face and they would jump to whoever I focused on in the group so that they had the scars too. Some other member of their group showed up and took over the job of taking a picture, so I was relieved of that duty. I went up to an outside deck, feeling bad and stupid about what had just happened.
