When I got to the cave I started walking down into the hole in the ground, I am usually afraid to walk down things like that, I guess I was always afraid to fall, but where there was usually fear was triumph, I fell once on my way down but got right back up and started again and I made it. It was so strange when I was walking down the path it looked like the everything was cheaple animated like as a cartoon charector would see if he was watching himself walk down a very steep hill.  When we all reached the bottom everyone got down in the water and walked into the cave itself. I just sat down on the grass. I looked up at the walls of the cave and the circular walls of rock was there but there was what looked like a white and green liquid oozing down the walls of the outer part of the cave and all flowing into the inner part of the cave, it looked like melting ice cream. I freaked out, I jumped up and started screaming for help, everyone else freaked out and started running to where I was at but before they could even get out of the water I remember yelling, this is fucking awesome. There was nothing to be afraid of. I then sat back down and I looked at my hand and it was decaying into bone, everyone saw me and started laughing because they knew I was peaking my balls off.
