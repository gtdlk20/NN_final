Bored of this we chose to carry on walking around discussing what was happening. Most of this is a complete blur to. What I do remember is trying not to focus on the hallucinations as, after a short while, they became too dominating. We eventually ended up at the house. I felt like the drug had left me and I grew tired. However, when I stopped to look at the small table in front of me and saw that it was stretched and out of proportion with itself (i.e. some legs were different sizes to the others but the table top remained level). I realised that the acid was still there. It was laying dormant whilst I was cold and my blood was running slowly. Now I was warm again, increased heart rate, the LSD was waking up.
