The night started when I had taken two tabs of what I believe to be LSD-25, and after being mugged of forty pound I recieved a phone call of a close mate who was eager to test the potentcy of the drugs we had just recieved. I had a further 13 tabs in my pocket at this point. On the way up to his house and after being lost for an hour walking up and down the same damn road and making numerous phone calls I finally managed to catch up with him.
