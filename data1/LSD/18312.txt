But my mind was extremely messed up from it all.  I kept thinking about the trip and what it meant to me.  What it all was.  What was the point?  It bothered the hell out of me and I couldnt figure it out.  I proceeded to start walking around in Cs room and back and forth to the bathroom to help clear my mind and think a bit.  No use.  I tried expressing this to my friends.  And as soon as I would get a clear definition in my mind of what had happened I would try to explain it and I would shortly forget almost immediately.  It was really aggravating.  After a while I started to have my friends worry about me a bit.  This really didnt help me at all.  It made me more irritated because I knew I wasnt having a bad trip, just a very strange one that had my mind very messed up.
