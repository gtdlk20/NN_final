Without saying anything beforehand, we giggled, all stood up and began stacking picnic tables to get onto the roof of the shelter. The shelter roof was steep and hard to crawl up. We managed somehow and layed on our backs and looked at the sky again. This time it was dominated by a massive pattern-covered dragon. It wasn't moving much, just sort of wiggling its legs and body a lot. The only words said in the next half-hour were mostly 'Wow' and 'Oh my God' etc. And that was enough, for we had Jimi to fill the gap of silence.
