Victor emerged from the room and sat down with a cig while we bugged him about taking the last cube. He was acting weird. Apparently he had been in his room with the light off, headphones on, and the door shut. He had been trying to hook up with Kim as well. He would only say 'oh'. we couldn't get him to say anything but 'oh'.
