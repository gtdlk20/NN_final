I got back to the room and we all decided to go for a walk. I suggested we walk to the sunken gardens, an outdoor mini-ampitheater of sorts surrounded by modern art sculpture, and in a very secluded part of campus. As soon as we stepped outside I noticed that the air quality was vastly superior to the air quality in my room. I also felt like I was about 10 feet tall, and floating above the ground. I was able to walk normally, save a few times when I stopped dead in my tracks to ask 'where are we going?' On the walk to the sunken gardens S and T had begun tripping, while W was feeling the 2C-I's energy and euphoria, but not really the psychedelic effects yet. We walked down the long secluded driveway to the gardens running back and forth across the road creating a 4-person weave.
