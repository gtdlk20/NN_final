Back at the car Bill and I decided we needed a campfire.  We had planned ahead and brought lighters, wood and newspaper to light, so we opened the trunk to get the materials.  'Wait, what were we doing again?' 'I forgot...I know we opened the trunk for a reason...hmm'.  Quickly forgetting everything, we danced for who knows how long before Marcus yelled 'Hows that fire comming along?' 'OH YEAH!  A fire!!'.  After forgetting what we were doing several more times the concensus between the four of us was that we were not of mental capacity to start and maintain a fire, and the idea was dropped.  In hindsight, we probably would have burned down the forest so its better that way.
