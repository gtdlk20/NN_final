We decided to smoke another bowl to set us off. We headed towards the baseball diamond, past it, and into a part of the park where people tend not to go, through a hole in a fence, and we were on a high cliff overlooking an authentic train yard. We smoked a bowl and walked along the cliff, and nothing was happening. We left the fence and I got my first real hit from the acid. We were standing on a hill next to the fence overlooking the baseball field and suddenly the green grass and the brown dirt of the baseball field all seemed to be bleeding into each other. The baseball diamond had grass seeping onto it and the sand from the baseball diamond was mingling with the outer reaches of the grass. The metal backstop was gleaming and glittering and hard to focus on.
