Note on pain relief: As I've written in previous reports, I have tried various materials for their pain relieving benefits, this one seems to work very well indeed, but I've had a few small twinges that suggest it may not persist more than a day or two. Obviously it is premature to judge that, and many substances have a strongly dose-dependent benefit.  For example, 5-MeO-DiPT at levels below about 14mg doesn't help me much, but at 16mg provided dramatic relief for at least a week.
