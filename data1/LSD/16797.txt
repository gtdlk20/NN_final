But the other way to look at what LSD did to me is much simpler. I was psychologically not fit to take a deep psychedelic substance, and took it anyways, something that fitted perfectly with my need to escape from reality. I have since been on the border of breaking down. Lack of energy, zoning out, overcomplicating everything simple in order to excuse myself from doing it, self loathing, hatred aimed towards everything, fear of others, fear of myself, and most of all, a hollowness that can be felt throughout my soul.
