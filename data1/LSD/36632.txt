Just me and a friend in my apartment. Took 2 doses and it came on quick. My friend turned on some Grateful dead and we sat with our eyes closed. Now about the time that space came on I was in a world of pros and cons. I was looking at every action and it was spinning off into infinite possibilites. I have been to this place many times and I was totally comfortable here. Then a sound came into my being. It was disrupting me. In that moment when I thought that I couldnt take it anymore and I was about to pop a very funny thing happend.   My head opened like a lotus, and I ejected into space. For a moment I was sitting weightless totally content and at peace with the infinite. Then infront of me a vibration started. It was was almost like space and time was ripping apart. I started to become restless and afraid. Then out of nothing something started to appear. At first it was just a speck then out of that speck a hand fractled out ward untill there were infinite hands all with eyeballs in the palm. The a body and a head followed. I looked on in wonder at the sight before me. Then I could do nothing but open my eyes, and when I did I was totally sober. LSD IS a hell of a drug!
