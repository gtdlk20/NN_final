Okay, I know what the readers are thinking.  What a moron, he just ate 9 hits of acid, rumored to be quite good.  Well, my friends, I must concur, but my concurrence will come later in this tale.  Right now, I just want to reiterate how little of a stranger I am to the discovery of Dr. Haufmann.  I've consumed as many as 10 hits of powerful acid in my day in public places, unfamiliar places, with a sour state of mind, etc.  I've dealt with 2 relatively bad trips and one was on a 9 hit escapade.  Let's just say that I'm very familiar with my body and it's reaction to LSD.
