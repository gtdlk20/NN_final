We found the river and we swam in it. Was amazing the cold water hit us like 1000 bricks in the chest. We hung out there for a while smoked another bowl and left. We drove home and crashed instantly I was so tired. Lsd was one of the most amazing moments in my life but not without its marks on my mentality.
