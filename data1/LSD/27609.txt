But first let me tell you about the circumstances of this experience. 5 days earlier I went to a huge rave (about 6000 people) in Cape Town, South Africa (where I live and where this whole story is set) ; I dropped a cap of acid and had the most uplifting, euphoric experience of my life. There were no fantastic visuals or anything - in fact 4 rfiends had caps from the same batch and said they were practically duds. Anyway , my trip was so good that I thought I must be the luckiest person out of all the thousands of people there ; I won't go into much more detail about it cause there are no words to appropriately describe what I had experinced. The point of this is that when it came to the trip Dave and I were to have later that week, I *knew* that it would be good; I was still basking in the glory of the one at the rave.
