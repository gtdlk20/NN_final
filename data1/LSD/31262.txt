Because of my state, Summer offered me to go to up to her suite. I accepted eagerly, seeing as the loK, which I clearly didnt belong it, was most definitely not where I had to be. When we stepped in, Summers suite mate, Amaya, was still awake, video chatting with some of her Indian friends. She was originally from Mumbai and oKen missed on sleep to keep in touch. We asked her what time it was, and she replied, Its six thirty AM now, I might go to sleep soon!.
