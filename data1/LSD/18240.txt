After I took the second tab there was not much time before the LSD started working. It felt as if a switch had been flipped and I was 100% sure I was feeling the effects. For the first half hour or so I spent so much time laughing my face hurt the next day and my abs hurt. After that time I'm not entirely sure but it felt like the second tab kicked in and I started experiencing a level of high I never have before.
