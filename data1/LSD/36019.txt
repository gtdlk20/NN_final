The whole thing was really an odd experience. Then the anxiety hit me, I cant quite remember how scared I was that night, but I know that the fright was overwhelming. I soon realized, after my trip, that the reason I got so scared was because of the place that I took the cubes in the start. It was new to me, so during the trip, everything seemed new to me, too new, and thats what scared me the most... I think atleast.
