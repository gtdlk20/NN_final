When we arrived, I very nearly started down a negative path again.  On a TV next to our table, there was a 'home video' show playing.  These videos showed horrible accidents or acts of violence caught on film, similar to shows like COPS.  I watched a three minute clip of a man nearly burning to death in his car, as well as a bus running over a woman's head.  I was too stunned to speak, and looked around the rest of the restaurant.  The restaurant specializes in buffalo chicken wings, which many of the people sitting nearby seemed to be eating.  The red hot sauce on their faces seemed almost like blood, and they were watching the show intently.  To me they seemed like vicious, bloody animals, enjoying a show of other peoples suffering.  I was disgusted by it, but luckily was saved from further negative feelings by my close friend B's sense of humor.  He was very stoned, and just as surprised as I was that a show like that could even exist.  His commentary on the utter ridiculousness of it entertained me long enough that they could finish eating (I was unable to eat), and we left the restaurant.
