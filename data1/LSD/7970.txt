7:00 AM. Everyone started to get tired; after all it had been about eight hours since we dropped it, plus the endless amount of waiting we had to endure for the stuff to actually get to us. The trip was starting to wear down and everyone had been lying in their sleeping spots for a while, still tripping and shaking. Strangely I didn't feel tired; I was just up and walking around looking at everyone wrapped up in their blankets like caterpillars in cocoons. The thoughts about the stolen hit were still in the back of my mind. Zac was still awake, and I was asking him about whom he thinks might have taken it 'I don't know man, but I have an idea for you if you're that worried about it.' 'Lay it on me.' 'You should go and eat one more hit, and tell the guy that theirs 2 hits on each gum.' It was a brilliant plan, one that would make even the Watergate masterminds say wow. At least it was to me. So I went to the fridge and opened it up and took one more hit.
