I'll try to explain as best as possible. We were seeing 'Where the Wild Things Are', based on the children's book. We were not counting on this being a terrifying, dark and depressing movie. To make matters worse, my experience watching the movie was essentially me being the character. I now fully understand what it feels like to be another person. I felt this kid's emotion, and better yet, I could smell every scene, feel everything. I smelt water at the ocean, I was cold when it snowed, I felt snow fall on my face. I was terrified at times, happy at others.
