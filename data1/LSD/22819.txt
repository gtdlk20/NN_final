At one point of the night, stupidly, my friend Pat spent $5 of my friends money on a glowstick. Alan and I were EXTREMELY hungry, so I thought as a joke to attempt to refund the glowstick to the mini-shop they had set up at the rave. I went to the shop and promptly stated: 'Yeah, Hi, Ahh, My friend took a shitload of acid, and hes fucking out, and he kinda took my wallet and spent my last $5 on buying this glowstick which I really dont want, and the money was to buy my tea.' The lady running the stall was so wasted herself she actually refunded it. I hadn't laughed so hard for ages, this was so funny to me.
