I put on some music on my wireless headset and blasted away. It was a generic summer music mix on youtube with some half naked girl on the thumbnail. I watched as she danced for me on the screen knowing full well I was watching a still picture. I walked around my place some more and at this point it felt like the world was updating once ever second or so, like watching a series of pictures in succession, but yet with a very smooth transition between the images. The music wasn't doing too much yet though.
