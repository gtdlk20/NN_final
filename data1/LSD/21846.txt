I am fairly new to LSD, and only a few days ago was my first time doing two tabs of the stuff. I can really only describe this experience as a high five with God himself. After buying 4 tabs for 20 bucks a pop, I figured this stuff had to be good. My friend had told me about how different two tab trips were from the single tab trips I was more familiar with. I was weary of this, but still confident because I had enjoyed the LSD experience so much before.
