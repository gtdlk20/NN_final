When I was 16, my best friend suggested that I take a trip with her. I had never tripped before, but I was open to anything, and so I said sure. About 11pm, she came over to my house and we snuck back to my room. We dissolved maybe like 1/8th of the paper each into paper cups of water, and drank it down.
