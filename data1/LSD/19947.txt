The stars that covered the ceiling had suddenly transformed into a full three dimensional reality and I was in the middle of it...naturally.  Some of the stars advanced towards me, some of the stars fell into the ceiling going further and further away.  And some seemed to just wiggle around where they were.  And then I noticed what the strobe light was doing to the painted ceiling and walls.
