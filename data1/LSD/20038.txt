Comparing it to MDMA, it was much more intense. The euphoria is on another level. It felt more unstable, lasted considerably shorter and needed a lot more work to get there though while MDMA is just a sure ticket to happiness. It felt like an effort going through the LSD trip, like I had to remain vigilant and on guard. Absolutely worth it though.
