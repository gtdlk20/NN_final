T+1:30:  We were listening to Portugal The Man's new album and I was watching the ceiling warp and change while the lyrics took me to a faraway place in my mind.  (This CD would set the tone for my battle to come.  If you have heard the album then you already understand.) I was having the time of my life and I believe I can safely say the same for Guitar and Singer.  Drums was slowly spiraling downward into his own introspection and wasn't liking what he was seeing.  We could feel the bad trip across the room.
