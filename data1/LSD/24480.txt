After a full day of such exploits we returned to the campus.  We stopped at the athletic center and our friend Karl was working.  He made us ham sandwiches.  We went back to our rooms, and Eric had to work.  So me and Lee decided to go with him.  There was some sort of concert, so Eric, Lee, and I became speaker moving machines.  After the night was done we returned to our rooms, and attempted to sleep, but sleep would not come.  So we watched movies until class.
