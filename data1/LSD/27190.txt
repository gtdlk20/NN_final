It all started the day my friend Shauna and I decided that we were going to go to a college fraternity party and that we wanted to be under the influence of some mind altering substance, instead of drinking like we normally did at parties.  And we wanted something stronger than just marijuana.  So, we talked to a friend and he said he could either get us Ectasy or LSD.  We told him either one would be fine.   I had done both before, and never had a bad experience.  Shauna had never done either, but wanted to be with me the first time she did.  Finally, he called and said that he had gotten us some acid.  So, we went and got it about 6pm.  The party started at 11, so we figured we would take it around 10.  The kid we bought it from told us not to take more than one at a time because they were really potent.  He called them Purple Monster.  They were tiny, with a purple background and a cartoon-like monster pattern on them.  So, we went back, stopped for some orange juice along the way and sat around till 10.  At 10pm, we took the first tab, then we got ready for the party.  We didn't feel anything yet when we arrived at the party.  Shauna kept asking me if she was supposed to be feeling it yet, and I said that it was odd that it hadn't kicked in yet.  By midnight, we were just feeling a little like we had smoked pot.  So, we left the party and walked back to our dorm with 2 guys we know that live a floor above us in the dorm. (Neither of them were on anything, they were just drunk.) As we were walking back (it's about a 10 min walk), it hit me that I was feeling it.  I looked back behind me to see if Shauna was feeling anything and the scenery blurred as I turned my head.  Everything seemed to be in slow motion.  Then, I knew that we were tripping.  I told Shauna to 'think happy thoughts,' as we had discussed what a bad trip was before we took it.  She asked a lot of questions before we took it, and understood what was going to happen...somewhat.
