All of a sudden I looked up between the branches of the tree I was under and all around the branches were electric lines tracing the outline. I started melting into the sand. I still felt weak because I hadn't settled in and closed my eyes. I saw the familiar checkerboard pattern behind closed eyes spiraling down. I gave up to the spiral and followed it down. Although I surely can't recall all my images and feelings, I remember seeing beautifully clear still images of friends and family laughing and loving. I remember chuckling and saying to myself how much I love these people. I distincly remember seeing a stuffed elephant toy from my childhood in beautiful technacolor.
