I walked for about 15 minutes, around my block and still didn't feel anything.  I was starting to get disappointed.  I thought about how hard it is to get acid or make it, and wondered why I thought that some person on the internet would have it.  I thought about a refund and didn't want to go through that with the seller, and not with my Silk Road account either.  I had read that they log your buyer stats and if you have too many refunds sellers might not want to do business.  I sure didn't need that so I thought about just taking it as a loss.
