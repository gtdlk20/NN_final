It was probably somewhere around 2 or 3 in the afternoon, at this point.  I walked several blocks to the mall in downtown, and retreated in a public restroom to drop a few hits.  I dropped 2, noted they tasted slightly of liquor, then left to walk the mall.  This was mistake #2.  People have told me before (and now I tell others) that you should ALWAYS drop only one, or even less, when you have bought a batch of unknown potency.
