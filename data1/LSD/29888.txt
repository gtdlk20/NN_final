After the smoke we head inside and there are so many questions running through my head the only 2 phrases I said for the wrest of the night were 'what the fuck?' and 'what is going on?' and maybe the occasional one word answer to someone. A decides that I'm wigging out too bad and takes me up stairs and throws me in a bed. The only problem is that I can't sleep. You can't sleep when you're in that deep of thought. I go back downstairs telling myself that there has to be more to this night.
