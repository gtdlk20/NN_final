The night continued and I still was happy, just more mellowed out.  I was also very aware of my back and neck.  It didn't hurt, rather I was just aware of it.  I also found myself becoming attached to different objects.  For example, I had been playing with a lighter and could not seem to put it down.  I didn't feel right if I put it down- for some reason I needed to be holding it.  The same thing happened to a sweater I had been wearing.  The entire trip was clear and not as visually crazy as tripping on mushrooms.  For example, I could have a normal conversation with someone, but when I am on mushrooms I don't like to talk to anyone and enjoy being by myself.
