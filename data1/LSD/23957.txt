Our nerves were calmed, and I noticed the glow in the sky that comes before the sunrise.  I realized we had been in Matt's bedroom most of the night, so we decided to go outside and experience the twilight.  It was magical.  With the knots in our minds blissfully unraveled, we immediately discovered an appreciation for the Here and Now.  A strong focus on the present actually turns out to be a common type of mystical experience. We'd never heard of anything about that before this time.  It just came naturally.  We both had an enormous sense of being present and purely, clearly aware.  It was an amazing experience beyond words. Just for fun, I'll say it was rather like sharpening a fuzzy picture, or wiping the dust off a mirror and feeling like 'oh yeah, that's how it's supposed to look'.  It was a very brilliant, glowing state of consciousness that still lingers today.
