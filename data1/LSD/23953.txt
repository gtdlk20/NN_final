Months after our trip around the merry-go-round, I read The Way of Zen, by Alan Watts.  In it, Watts describes the liberated person basically as someone who has seen the fruitlessness of grasping at oneself and stops trying as a result.  According to Watts, that's what's called Nirvana.  The opposite of frustrating self-consciousness.  Of course many thinkers have attached other ideas to Nirvana but mainly the idea is liberation from the whirlwind of trying to figure everything out.
