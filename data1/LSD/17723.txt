There is little left to tell of this story, except to say my walk from the hospital to the train station was quite distressing, I was in a lot of pain . had stitches in my chin, my elbow and hand. My right forearm had swollen up purple making it look like Popeye's right hook.  I was still semi-hallucinating but very aware of how I'd nearly died and how I had a lot of explaining to do when I got home to my girlfriend. There were no legal repercussions for giving the police the slip , I had caught a train back home to a village in Suffolk which was not in the jurisdiction of the Norfolk constabulary, however they had contacted my father who was in Norfolk , so I had quite a bit of explaining to do for him too!
