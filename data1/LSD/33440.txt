After a few seconds my gestalt shifted. My world view changed. Finally, I realized what was going on. Clearly I was on drugs. I must have eaten something funny. My pack was concerned for me. Oh, did I mention that I must be a tripping gorilla who had hallucinated the entire human race? I got down of the speaker box and left the dance floor. I climbed the hill behind the temple to have a better vantage point, and for at least the next couple of hours I sat their, watching the dance floor pulsing, marveling at the ability of my ape brain to create such a complex hallucination as mankind. It wasn't until just before sunrise that my peak subsided, and I realized what had been going on. It was, to this day, the most intense trip and comedown I have ever experienced. I wouldn't trade it for the world.
