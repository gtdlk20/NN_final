During the 5 and a half hour voyeur to Tuscaloosa to visit my comrade he called my cell phone and told me that he had a birthday present for me.  I sped up to 80 miles an hour in anticipation.  Finally, with punk music blaring I pulled up to the unfamiliar territory and was greeted by him outside.  I dropped my backpack on the driveway and hugged his neck.  It had been damn near a year since we last spoke in person and even when I arrived we spoke, wordless.  Nothing but pleasant company was to be had.
