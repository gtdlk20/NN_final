Later I sobered up.  I was still deeply affected by my experience, but I wasn't naive enough to actually believe in god.  After all, even if the psychological cause of disbelief had to do with my parents, this didn't give me any reason to believe god existed.  Moreover, I was not convinced this was the reason for my loss of faith.
