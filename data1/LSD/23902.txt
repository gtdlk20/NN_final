I thought about what I just did, and was able to gather my thoughts. I then realized that it was pitch dark out, and I needed to get back to my campsite which I had no idea how to get to. I walked up to these guys camping, and asked one if he could show me back to the store he did, which wasn't too far. I found a couple friends standing near my car, whom I was very glad to see. They told me I had been gone for eight hours, and they had been looking for a bit.
