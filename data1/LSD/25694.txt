I began to feel as though i needed to be alone. so after convincing everyone that it was fine i went out onto the second floor porch. I looked over the railing and saw a hole dug into the garden below, a body in a sack curled up next to it. At first i was afraid, but then i realized what was going on. That was my old self, my old body before this amazing trip. I had reached a new level of awareness and this old self was being cast back to the earth. it was a very beautiful moment for me. I watched the body enter the grave and plants grew up over it. A river appeared before me and i washed my hands in the river. AS i had experienced this, a shaft of light had flashed in the sky repeatedly. I am not religious, but i reached an inner peace with part of myself because of that vision.
