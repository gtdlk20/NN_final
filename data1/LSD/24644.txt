I pull him aside, and say whats in your pockets man? I dont mind whatever it is as long as its not a gun, but your pockets are bulging. So he leans close to me and says 'I have a bible dropped out in my pockets, let me sell tonight hassle free and you're fed all night'. I said 'deal'. He hands me 3 sweet tarts and says 'be careful, they're triple dripped'. I hand him a bracelet, say ok, no problem, and eat all 3. Where I'm from, we only get LSD thats been cut by one or two or forty people, so I'm used to weak stuff.
