8:30 AM. The yard was beautiful; I could see the leaf of every tree, each blade of grass, and every bug in radiant color. The whole thing looked like a big high definition T.V. and was so intense that it almost hurt to look at. Walk around the block, I told myself. Get everything out of this trip, you've just taken another hit, you've got another eight hours or so. So I popped in my MP3 player and started down the road. Everything was perfect, I was so overwhelmed by the beauty of everything that it was almost too fascinating to believe. The only way to describe the feelings would be to get in a near death accident, and learn to appreciate everything a little bit more. The road's gravel looked like small marbles that were moving around my feet when I came down onto the ground. Before I knew it I was back at the house.
