Some wierd stuff happend during the process of all that. One of my friends had a bike and I rode it every now and then during the walk to the station and every time I did I started seeing patterns on the ground but not your usual ones like geometric shapes, oh no. These patterns were telling some kind of story that I really didn't understand but ok.
