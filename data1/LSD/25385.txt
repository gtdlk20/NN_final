Around this point my memory becomes rather vague.  I remember being hungry and eating something but not what that something was.  My friends tell me they remember seeing me munching on some paper and subsequent investigations revealed that in my delerium, I had eaten the entirety of the rest of my acid. Time ceased to move forward of its own accord.  Events would only proceed through a conscious excercise of will.  Additionally, I no longer chose to do things, I chose the alternate reality in which I did the things I wanted myself to do - an fine distinction. I gradually lost touch with my fundamental understanding of who and what I was.  I had the strange fear that I had seen a deeper layer of reality and, having done so, I would never be able to regain a normal viewpoint; never be able to pull the wool back over my eyes. Out of the whirling ball of paranoia that I had become, one thought concept finally cut through and calmed me.  I realized that no matter what straits I found myself in, whatever trials I faced, just by concentrating on the moment and living for that instant alone I could always be perfectly content.
