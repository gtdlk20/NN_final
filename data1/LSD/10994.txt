When there were no more impure segments of ceiling left to be flushed out I looked back at the aloe plant just in time to see a translucent spiral coming out of the plant and heading towards me. At the very instant that spiral touched me I felt my spirit being quickly scrubbed down, as if the aloe plant was giving me a final spot-clean. This happened almost instantaneously, and in my mind there was no doubt about what was going on. When it was finished I felt totally pure and clean, and even more relaxed than before.
