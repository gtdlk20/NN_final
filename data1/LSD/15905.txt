I could feel the mindfuck coming again. I didn't know how strong it was going to be and really underestimated it. T went to do some homework while I was tripping and let me hang out in her room for a while. During this time, there were too many thoughts going on in my head at once. I was trying to make sense of what was going on around me and kept telling myself 'It's just because you're on acid' but it wasn't working. Over and over, I'd get these thoughts in my head and try to make something out of them but they just kept spinning and spinning through my head and I could see the chaos everywhere around me. It started turning into a very uncomfortable world where nothing felt right. It didn't feel like acid anymore, it felt like I was going insane. I'd never went that far into acid and tripped like that. I was getting lost in my thinking over and over again. I thought the peak was over, and T's mom was coming home soon so I decided it would be a good time to leave. I said my farewell and left the coolest room I'd ever seen in my life.
