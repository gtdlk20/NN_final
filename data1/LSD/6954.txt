I puzzled with an impending old age (IÂ’m 65yo) and I wonder if I was projecting myself into that possibility.  I am realizing that I have a lot of anxiety, not about dying but about being incapacitated and in pain.  Perhaps I don't have anything to fear? I had a lot of energy in me that needed release.  Why it came out in tears and shaking/spasming electricity I have no idea.
