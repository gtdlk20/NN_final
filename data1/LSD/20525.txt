After tripping and tripping and tripping we finally decide to call it a night. Its about 5:30am and we both head back to our houses; we were pretty much already at my house. As my friend heads back to his home I head inside and plop right down in bed. I honestly feel like I cant sleep not only because Im tripping in another dimension still but I feel like Im like super aware of every organ in my body like every muscle, artery, tissue etc. just I could feel it all like I was just super hyperaware and I didnt like it at all and I couldnt sleep because of it. I recently saw a video trip report on YouTube of a girl from the Netherlands who took LSD and also said she had this same feeling towards the end of the trip where she felt aware of all of her organs and insides. She said getting up and dancing made it not so bad anymore but that wasnt an option for me in my room in the middle of the night.
