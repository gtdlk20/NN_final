Eventually her husband popped his head outside (obviously because she was talking to me forever) and to her he was just likeWhat are you doing..? he looked so puzzled as to why she was even talking to me. And shes like This is Ryan! He lives in the neighborhood I was getting to know him. The way he looked physically waswell funny and cartoonish. He literally looked animated in some kind of way or just really surreal and corky like a real life cartoon and felt that he was just another funny unique cartoon character in this world who had something of his own to say whether it was nice or not. Hes a pretty big (fat) guy and at this time he looked just completely round..like literally round and his whole body and his head was just another round sphere on top of this bigger round sphere which was his body. It was just like 2 circles stacked on each other and his slight concernment had me kind of amused and I wanted to laugh at the surreal situation. He tells her something like wellyou should come inside or something along those lines and I cant remember how long after that but we eventually part ways and she goes back in or something and I leave to finally go and meet up with my friend to give him the acid because he still hadnt taken it and I was already knee dip in this experience apparently.
