While he did that, I went to the bathroom when I felt like I may have to urinate.. It was a strange sensation, like I may already be peeing my pants, or could lose control of my bladder at any moment.  I had been queezified by the sight of a mutating bubbling human head with wispy white hair.  So I figured my best bet was to take my mind off it and take a break from my company.... and possibly vomit.  but walking through the house quickly brought me to a better state of mind.  Once inside the bathroom, my trip went all 'cats' on me.  Not the musical (thank God). But I was looking and peeing down into the toilet bowl and the shape of the hole in the bottom was transformed into the mouth of a cat lapping up my yellow stream.  This completely captivated and showed me that the normally unseen was on my side, ready to drink my urine should I require it to.  Hesitantly, I looked in the mirror above the sink and initially saw my face with every pore and detail. My face then grew whiskers and stripes and became a Tiger face.  Not realistic, but it looked like an asian style tiger face tattoo I've seen. It surprised me how level headed I was at this time and how enjoyable it was to be seeing all these things transformed to cats.  Being turned into a tiger was a pretty rad idea to me. I think I also enjoyed being alone, by this time I had probably been in the bathroom for 10 minutes just gazing in wonder as the world became a living thing with a vivid imagination.
