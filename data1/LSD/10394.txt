A little background is first necessary before I delve into the long story that this trip report will undoubtedly become.  I was 19 years old at the time, and not exactly new to altered states of consciousness.  I had experienced mushrooms four times previously, ecstasy numerous times, nitrous oxide, speed and smoked weed almost every day.  I was also at a stage in my life where I wasnt quite sure of who I was in the world and, as I later realized, not very aware or awake in the Buddhist sense.
