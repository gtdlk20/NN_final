Anyway it became available to me one more in the middle of the 90s. I got hold of a couple of microdots to begin with which were always my favourite and a guaranteed 6 hour trip. Then some paper trips became available but I found the strength of them to be a bit weak and I was taking at least four at a time to get anything near a decent trip.
