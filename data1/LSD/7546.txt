At some point I eventually went back on to my laptop to try and listen to music, thinking that upbeat songs might improve my mood.  Unfortunately, music remained 'upsetting' (this is the best word but still not a good one) and to make matters much worse, the album art of the song I was listening to featured a mug shot of Frank Sinatra from when he was apparently arrested as a young man.  The association with crime was negative in itself, but I also hallucinated at this time that there was a black bar drawn across his eyes as well, like the people on the TV.  This little experience put me close to a state of outright despair, and I had a terrible body anxiety, kind of like a restlessness.
