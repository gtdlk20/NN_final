I then proceeded onto the telephone call home. I struggled to recollect the number but finally managed to punch in something I thought was a close approximation. A womens voice answered and I didnt recognise it. Rather than explain wrong number and hang up, I was so disjointed I made a couple of inarticulate sounds and hung up. As soon as the phone disconnected I realised that it was my mothers voice that I had just hung up on. Now in some kind of panic I struggled to find any small change and just flung in the first coin I had. I managed against the mental randomness to explain to my mother that I was staying out, I was very drunk, it was me on the last call I and had dropped the phone.
