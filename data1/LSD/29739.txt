For a time from mid-summer 2007 to September of that year I went on an acid binge where I would trip every weekend on at least two hits.  This was without a doubt a life changing experience; I felt that I learned more about myself and my niche in the social network I had been creating the past 20 years.  I had tripped on acid 2 times before the summer binge and upwards of 25 times on mushrooms prior dating back to 11th grade.  So I guess you could say that my classroom acid experience was the culminating event/day of my very memorable summer binge.
