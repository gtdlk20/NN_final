5:17: Two minutes later I find that the music and my thoughts are being evoked almost visually, I say almost because it seemed archetypal, like the vector equation was there, but it hadnt been processed into explicit imagery yet. I write Music is beautifully complementing my thoughts like a fractal realization growing more pervasive in the membrane of imagination. It would seem the body load has lessened and the trip is again quite enjoyable.
