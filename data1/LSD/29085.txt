When I got there, I was hallucinating. I thought that there were two amish children standing at the far end of the parking lot, waiting to kill me when I left my car, so I ended up taking a golf club with me for protection. Also, the campsite sign said 'Umbrella Fantastic' as I entered, instead of 'Camp *****'. I walked to the campsite by myself, as it wasn't dark yet and I wasn't too disoriented, especially since I had been to this particular grounds many times before.
