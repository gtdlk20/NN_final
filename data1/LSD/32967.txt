I forgot I was on acid, I felt like the same people kept passing us as we sat on a park bench and I struggled to see if things were really close or really far away. I knew something was weird but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I felt like I was in some dreamy state, I couldn't talk and I couldn't really get my head around what other people were saying. I could understand each individual word but the whole sentence sounded like jibberish.
