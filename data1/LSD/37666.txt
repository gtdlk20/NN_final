For a while I had been wanting to trip because of all the stuff i heard about it. None of my friends liked tripping but i was not convinced. One a saturday night, my friend and i went to the Rocky Horror picture show, mainly because i wanted to sell some ecstacy i had. I ended up traded two rolls for a little baggie. In the baggie was supposevely acid. They looked like little purple insect legs. I do not remeber what they were called, but they said they were the cuttings left over from the sheet of gels or something. I was doubtful but trusting because it was my friend's boyfriend. We went out back and she put two of the bug-looking legs on my tongue. They tasted kinda strange. I let them dissolve and we went on with our night.
