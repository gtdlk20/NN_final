My sense of touch was as heightened as my sense of sight, it felt as though my I could keep pulling off my skin as I pinched myself. I amazingly could pinch myself as hard as I possibly could and would not feel any pain. It was as though I was encased in a layer of dough. As well as my own skin, my dogs fur felt pretty amazing in-between seeing him turn into a wolfish looking creature and then appear as himself. The colour of his fur would change colour uniformly as if adjusting the hue of a picture on a computer screen, by now it had been about 2 hours since it took the LSD. I was feeling very different but it still knew where I was and what was going on and I still had a good 4 or so hours until anybody would come home. I figured that it wouldnÂ’t come on anymore and I would be fine by about 3:00pm.
