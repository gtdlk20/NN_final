It was only at this point I noticed any visuals at all, perhaps because of the changes in lighting from outside to inside.  I noticed his floor waving like water, it was a blue carpet.  Most noticeable was his face began melting and moving in ways similar to the animation in the movie 'Waking Life'.  I mentioned it to him, and he laughed, happy that I had any visuals at all.
