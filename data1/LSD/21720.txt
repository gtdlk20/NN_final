After that episode, which I simply couldn't believe, we headed back to my house.  I tried to sleep, but it was after 7 am before I managed to get a couple of hours.  I awoke and looked in the mirror - one of my pupils was dilated, the other wasn't...  That wasn't what I needed to see either...  But it returned to normal an hour or two later.
