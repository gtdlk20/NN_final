There was one very interesting moment of note. I briefly went in to my bedroom to change my away message online. In typing my new one, 'tripping in 7-11 the shelves were stretching out of control' (note: that's a Nada Surf lyric; the store we were in that night was not a 7-11), I had a definite weird, weird, weird moment. I wasn't typing so well because my hands were shaking somewhat and I wasn't, for obvious reasons, seeing the screen too well, or to rephrase--I was seeing the screen VERY well, thank you, but not entirely, well, correctly.
