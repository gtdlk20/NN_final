That thought consumed me for awhile and I got stuck wondering if I really did want to go out there and explore the deeper parts of my psyche or not, and for what reason. It felt like the person that was me was trying to actively fight from letting that happen. I kept telling myself, or kept telling the entity that was me, that on a rational level I didnt want to do that because Summer was going to need me and I couldnt ignore her to explore myself. But then I began thinking was that just my subconscious trying to give me a reason not to do it, it saying do not do that youll regret it, in a way I would be able to understand and likely agree to. And the thing is that there were parts of this thought process that felt like it wasnt me thinking it but as if I was thinking of myself in the third-person.Thinking outside of myself.  Not me thinking it but the entity known as Valkeir, if that entity even was a thing at that point for me. Eventually after looping through this a bit I came to the conclusion that it was probably good Summer was there to keep me from doing it, regardless of the reason, just because going into a dark room with shadows, with some of the thoughts that were rattling around in my brain, and being by myself, may have been a recipe for disaster and she kept me from that. Kept me from falling into a possible pit of something through her need for my presence.
