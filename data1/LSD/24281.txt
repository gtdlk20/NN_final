Around 4:45 we were all together in Jim's car driving along. He gives us each 2 sweet tarts with acid dropped on them and he took 3 himself. I can safely say that by 5:30 we were all tripping VERY HARD. Jim was sick of driving so we went back to K-Mart's parking lot (where my car was) and I started driving around.
