I am flying over the ocean.  Not really in a body, just looking down at the ocean from high above.  There's a ship down there.  I'm not really paying attention, not too concerned with whatever is happening.  Somehow, I know that this is the Pacific Theater of World War II.  Somewhere near Japan or the Phillipines. Somehow, I become aware that I am a man on the ship.  There is a violent explosion in which I am killed.  It is very disturbing, I look away, horrified.  It's terrible, terrible.  My body is ripped apart.  It's awful.  I turn away. I'm up in the sky looking down.
