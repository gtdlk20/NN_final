At this point, my other friends left the room, leaving me alone to try and fix the table in vain.  I gave up, and simply sat on the floor and reflected on the experience.  I wasn't sure what time it was, and I thought maybe my acid had started to wear off, which would explain why I felt so peaceful compared to earlier.  However, as soon as I thought that, the tiles underneath me began to warp.  The darker brown stripes of the tile began to slowly writhe and spread out like liquid.  This dark mass seemed to be made up of many small particles, like a swarm of ants, and it crawled from tile to tile, linking up into a larger mass.  It crawled up the wall, and up my own arm, until the formerly white room was nearly covered in this dark substance.  All at once, it began to swirl in unison, creating a moving pattern on every surface it touched.  Instead of frightening me, I was content and in awe of what I was witnessing.  I left the room to join my friends in the larger part of the basement, and the patterned mass followed me everywhere I looked.  The furry carpet on the floor was breathing peacefully, with each little strand of fabric dancing in the air.  I looked down at my arm and could see the black particles flowing through my veins, and my hairs seemed to grow in and out of my arm.
