It was the end of April, and a friend and I were working security at a rave in northern La. We start the day off with several bowls from the glass pipe and our ounce bought the day before, and have several more on the 3 hour drive to the venue. By the time we get to the venue, down to 3/4 ounce, very high, and full of positive energy about the evening ahead. Three hits hidden behind my drivers licence wrapped in foil, but not until I work the door a bit first. Not really caring about what people bring into the party, just watchin for weapons and all, I get to check out most of the people coming in. An hour later I dose, it's 10:00, the party's just starting, and the line slims down for a bit. A peculiar looking guy walks in, who we'll call legos for the remainder of the story, because his facial features and skin tones looked very similair to those on Lego men. Anyways, I pat legos down like everyone else, and his pockets bulge from every angle.
