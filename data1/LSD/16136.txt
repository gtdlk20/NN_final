After a while of driving, I could not sit in the car any longer with this madness, so I quickly started thinking of solutions that would help me, but none of them were logical, including the one were I drop him off at his house and leave him for his mother to deal with, which seemed the most amusing to me at the time. As I continued our drive around town, circling many of the same streets over and over again, Matt seemed to be coming out of his head trip and I began to realize that he was becoming coherent again. We decided to make our way back to his house where we could end the day by sitting in his basement. His mother was still sleeping but after ringing the doorbell, she quickly arose to let us in. She had discovered something in her son's face that made her believe we were in some sort of trouble and asked us many questions when we arrived that made me severely paranoid. We made our way to the basement finally where I put Fight Club and began to watch with my friend.
