So we arrived latter that night at 10 o'clock and took our hits at around 10:20. Everything was running very smoothly we had started to come up very quickly. We were all sitting in A's room listening to the album Gamehendge by Phish which was extremely amazing in all aspects. The visual and physical effects of this trip were beyond anything that I have experienced before.
