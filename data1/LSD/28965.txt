I should mention I'd been a pretty nasty alcoholic up until my night in God's court; 3-4 litres of whiskey a week, sometimes more. I was quite disoriented when I got back from the high dose Acid trip, but one thought was quite clear in my mind; the drinking was over. I was quite disoriented when I got back from the high dose Acid trip, but one thought was quite clear in my mind; the drinking was over. Not 'The drinking will stop soon' or 'I need to moderate my drinking'...it wasn't like that, I had quit pretty vehemently during my concourse in the light. The smell of ethanol makes me gag, beer smells like farts, and wine like grape juice someone left in the sun. It was OVER, I tell you.
