Afterwards we laid in bed talking. I was amazed that I was still tripping, and said that if this were any other time I would love to trip like I was tripping right now, but by this point (around 4:00am) I was physically exhausted. The 2C-I was still keeping S awake. Likewise, the CEV's that consisted of complex and random chain-reaction Dali-esque machines were keeping me awake. So we stayed up talking, and generally confusing each other, cracking up frequently until finally exhaustion won the battle and I drifted off to sleep around 5:00am, almost 10 hours after having dosed.
