I'm still in the afterglow of that trip--those few days following a really great, intense experience. I feel like I've seen things in a way that's, well, wholly new. I also, having come down from the trip, have a great appreciation for the way things ARE normally. Tripping is a great experience, but by the twelfth hour it gets wearing. The next day, and the day after, and the day after that, it's still a little comforting to look at an LCD touch screen and SEE an LCD touch screen, the way you know it really is; to be able to look in the mirror without your face stretching adn melting and morphing around itself; to put on makeup without feeling like you're in danger of rubbing your nose away; to buy a pack of cigarettes and not really notice all that garish neon.
