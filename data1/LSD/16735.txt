Myself and two other close friends, both of whom had been present at my first trip, which also happened to be collectively, our first trip. We decided to plan a trip into a small country house located in a small village somewhere along the west cost of the UK. As with any well planed trip we came prepared with all the usual suspects, namely shit loads of top notch music, some hash, food, an open mind and youthful sprit. When we arrived it was within an hour of dusk. We each dropped a trip of strong acid. As we waited for the trip to come on, lets call him bob, set up the sound system, while I rolled a joint. Nothing like a smoke to kill the jittery first hour or so before the onset of the trip. In retrospect nothing could have prepared me for this trip.
