Now I am floating, ascending upwards through many red and gold spinning pentagrams. I pop out in a vast open space.  There is bright light everywhere, so I can hardly see anything.  I feel like everything is totally peachy.  I feel great, not scared at all.  This is a wonderful place.  If I was a Christian I would definitely say I was visiting heaven.
