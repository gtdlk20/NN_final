We did a bunch of stuff there, and then we went over to our good friends house that was just out of rehab. I was very excited to see him, so we all went there. We watched a movie that I thought was hilarious, and then I went home for the night and ate a bunch of my Halloween candy that my parents got me (they're nice folks).
