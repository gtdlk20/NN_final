T 3:30-5:30 - I'm still tripping delighfully hard.  My own trip experience completely correlated with the movie, which I only realized until after the movie.  I'll admit it, I am an alcoholic, so I found many parallels between me and Oliver Stone's inaccurate portrayal of Jim Morrison.  I was tripping almost at my peak when the band goes out into the desert to do acid.  As I am making more and more drinks and getting a little drunk, Morrison breaks away from his band and starts doing cocaine and drinking to excess, just as I am now doing.  By the end of the movie I'm still tripping, but not nearly as hard as before.
