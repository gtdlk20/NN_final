I had gotten hold of some acid from an acquaintance of mine and decided to share it with some friends I knew had been looking for it for some time.  K. and I had both tripped twice before (both of mine were pleasant, and mild).  C. had never done acid, and he decided to try it.  We each took an initial dose of blotter paper, before deciding to get our hands on some more from the same supplier.  By that time, J. and B. joined in and we had a group of five.  The stage was set as I began to feel the effects first....
