By this point it was after 10:00 pm (it was the first time I really became aware of time) and me and J decided to go to his friend A's house.  I was feeling down from the acid by this point (though still slightly disjointed from reality, like after a weed comedown) so I drove us to A's place where he and his girlfriend had been drinking wine.  The four of us all drank a bunch of wine, smoked a lot of weed, and watched Across the Universe.  The movie, alcohol, and marijuana all combined to bring back the tripping state of mind (though with virtually no visual effects) and left me feeling very comfortable, much more so than I had felt at any other part of the night.
