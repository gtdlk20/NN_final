The effects started in about 20-30 minutes.  The effects were strongly physical - a tingling, tense, nervous sensation.  As the body load increased I began to recognize it as extremely pleasurable.  I sat listening to music, psychedelic trance and drum & bass, and I just felt incredibly alive.  The effects increased and I started sweating, twitching, and feeling unsteady.  I looked very strange in the mirror.  It occurred to me that intense body sensations may be a prerequisite to a fundamental mental or spiritual experience.  I understood why people often require strenuous physical work, like climbing a mountain, to have spiritual experiences - the bizarre physical sensations put you out of your element and lower your boundaries to prepare you for a deep mental experience.  I am an atheist, but I kept thinking 'If I was only religious, I would be so enraptured by god right now!'  For a moment I thought I believed in god, but I am such a died-in-the-wool nonbeliever that it didn't quite happen.
