T+1.5 hours: We were already beginning to peak. At this point the clouds were thousands of swirling puffs and the sun was making everything shimmer in gold. The street was getting windy (visually) and narrower and the woods were much more accented and dense. It literally got to the intensity where I was starting to get a bit scared to walk in the street. I would get SO amazed by something that I would just wander off into the middle of the road and I sure as hell didn't want to get hit by a car. So I began walking on the grass. Naturally being in the grass of course makes it so that the hair on my arms begins to increase and I begin to acquire cat-like attributes. I am rolling in the grass very happily, yet kind of scared to go anywhere as now I am tripping balls.
