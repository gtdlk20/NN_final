My tripping friend eventually did after trying the acid obviously but my Russian friend seems to have a bias against synthetics. He (like us) never dreamed a synthetic could give an experience of cosmic consciousness or really even understand how it could. I don't blame him either but anyways both me and my friend on acid are both very awake at this point, everything is very vibrant and I want to say kind of artistic and perceptual. We both feel very zestful and excited at this point and were having a pretty good time. All three of us wax on about philosophies and even some stupid scary subjects like the Russian Sleep experiment. Its almost like our Russian friend was trying to trip us out or really get our thoughts going which I should have known but had no problem with. He even at one point tried to bring up different LSD myths about people cracking their backs in his house before and having 'LSD flashbacks' even though that is not even remotely close to how flashbacks really work and I explained this all to him and whatever. He even tried to bring up some kid who had a flashback and died because he had a seizure and I didnt believe him for one second (obviously because its bullshit) and just said Fuck him, Im glad hes dead. I think I even started laughing after I said that.
