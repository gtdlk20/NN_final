We took two blotters each at around 11:00 in the morning, at my house (I share a house with some university friends), and sat around on the verandah in the sun waiting for it to come on.  About 15 minutes of cigarettes and idle chatter passed before we decided to walk to the store and get some juice and something to eat.  The trip to the store passed uneventfully, and we returned to my house approximately half an hour later, still with no noticeable effects.  We decided to put on some music (Radiohead - Amnesiac) and sit in the lounge room listening to it.
