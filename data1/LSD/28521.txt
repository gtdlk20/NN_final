I realized I was having my first bad acid trip and felt like I was about to have a psychotic breakdown. I ran out of the room and decided to talk to my friend. He has long curly hair and as he was trying to talk me down, all I saw was little versions of his face in his own hair laughing at me. My best friend now seemed like a freakish demon in my eyes. I decided to go outside and get some fresh air. I stepped outside and the sun was now setting. I had taken the cid hours ago and it took me soo long to peak that I realized I might be tripping for much longer than I had expected. I saw downtown Chicago with all the lights on and a purple sky with the sun setting and it seemed so beautiful that it hurt my eyes to look at it. In fact my eyes were so dilated that I could not really see anything more than 20 feet in front of me too clearly and people in the distance seemed hazy and unfocused. I decided to go back inside and have a beer, hoping the alcohol would take the edge off..and it did. In fact I got a pint of rum and decided to just get drunk to calm the whole trip down.
