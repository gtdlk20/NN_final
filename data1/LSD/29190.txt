Anyway one night a friend turned up with some papers fresh off the boat and wanting to make sure I had a good trip I went for the big one and took ten. It knocked my socks off and I went on the most amazing journey I had ever had on lsd. Every trip I had before this one I had been in control of no matter how strong the hallucinations were I could always control them. This trip was completely different though because not only did I lose control I lost my sense of everything around me and went completely subjective. The first thing I remember is popping right out of my body which I could see lying on the floor against the living room wall. I dont remember everything about what went on but I do remember some really heavy stuff like the death of ego where it felt like every thought or idea I had ever had was being ripped out of me like having a limb ripped off and having the pain to go with it. And being aware of all the mistakes I had made in life and having this overwhelming urge to kick myself for every time I said yes when I should have said no and vice versa.
