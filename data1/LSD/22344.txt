I've always gotten very nervous right before I've tried a drug for the first time and I was nervous this time too, even though I had tried it before. I've heard the whole 'set and setting' thing and I knew I should stay calm but it was difficult to do and I let my boyfriend take the acid before I did. He took a tab and I started out with half of a tab. My friend C took a few prescription pills of something or other like ritalin and was drinking vodka and rum. I had a feeling our tripping and his high wouldn't mix well but we did it anyway.
