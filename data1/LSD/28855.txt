The last time I was fortunate enough to take LSD, I was at home with two of my friends and my folks out of town.  I had to work earlier that day, and I spent the entire day on the phone with my friend Justin trying to close a deal on some acid.  We were finally able to obtain 10 drops of some liquid on two sugar cubes, five generous drops on each.  When I finally got off my shift at work, it was arranged for me to meet Justin's friend to pick up and pay for the acid, which I did.  I went home and immediately put the sugar cubes in the fridge to keep the acid 'fresher' for the night's activities.  My friend Justin showed up and we went out and got some Chinese take-out to wait for Kyle.
