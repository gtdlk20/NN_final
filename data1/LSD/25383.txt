My previous acid trip had been in a low-key environment but I had no qualms about trying it in the frenetic atmosphere of a party for some reason.  I intended to drop and take ecstacy later on. I took 2 hits of a large sheet and then proceeded to deal out a score of caps of E waiting for the effects to kick in.  The building was quite familiar to me; in my area there are few venues available to rave promoters.  Every time I went to a party there it seemed smaller.
