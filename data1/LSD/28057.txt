I've had some really wonderful trips, and have learned quite a lot from this chemical. Its perspective cannot be wrong, just different. How many times has it been said or implied lsd drives you crazy? Are the Beatles crazy? They have done more, and better, LSD than I ever will. Didn't Rock Hudson (or was it Cary Grant) use it? Didn't the CIA? Why must scare tactics be used to squash anything the gov/power-structre doesn't like? Informed, intelligent adults should have the powers of choice, including choice of chemicals. This current prohibition will be no more successful than the last one, in its stated purpose. It has been very successful in its real purpose. Freedoms must be taken if the WoD is to work, and the typical person is too afraid to stand up and question or comment. Places like this are indespensible resources for dissemination of the real truth, and the real news. I thank NetGod that I need not depend upon the TV for news, or our local slanted rag.
