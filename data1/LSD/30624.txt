From here on I must have been wandering around. I can recall moments of clarity, when I could navigate. Identifying a  sign for a bakery which I headed for. It was only about 50m away, but it felt like an eternity. I felt like I was trapped in a loop and that I had been striding the same block for ever. I could not tell if I was alive or if I had gone to hell, and it being a state of eternal repetition.
