I walked into my bathroom and when I looked in the mirror, it was not me in the reflection. I mean obviously it was me but it didnt look like me. I looked like a fucking lunatic: like an insane psychopath. How is this decision going to affect my life? What is happening to the world? I felt like my entire idea of reality was just falling apart. I put on some music and hopped in the shower. The warm water comforted me, and I started to feel better. I realized, what the hell, Im still tripping so I might as well enjoy it. I was smiling, moving to the music again, thinking positive thoughts. I became amazed by the patterns made by the wet and dry parts of my shower curtain, and water droplets looked distorted and split up into a symmetrical arrangement. I sat in the bottom of my shower for what seemed like hours, just thinking about the crazy night I just had. My whole idea of reality was just shattered; I realized there was so much more to the world than what I had previously thought. Was I going insane? No, no, Im just on acid.
