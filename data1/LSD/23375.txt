We went back inside after about 15 minutes?  My sense of time was starting to get really out of whack.  Anyway, we got back into his room.  Nick's face was flushing and he had a mild case of the sweats, but given my state of mind, I thought he was about to explode.  I thought that he must not be breathing.  I told my non-tripping friend what I thought, and he played along.  I kept telling him, 'Nick's not breathing, Nick's not breathing,' (I thought I was whispering but was really talking quite loudly) until I convinced Nick himself that he was not breathing.  Surprisingly enough, neither of us really got freaked out, especially since I was comforted by the fact that if someone stopped breathing, they would go unconscious and would begin breathing again.
