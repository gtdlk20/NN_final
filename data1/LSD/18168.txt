There I was, trudging through waist-high grass carrying an absurd amount of things and smoking a cowboy killer. I arrived at the water's edge and sat down in the grass which made the grass a little taller than myself. I breifly took note that the seed pods of the weeds I was sitting amongst were pulsating, 'very cool' I thought. I fumbled around with the boombox and put in a mix cd I had made months before and hit shuffle. The first song that played was 'one of these days' by Pink Floyd. I remained in the sitting position for about half of the song observing the grass and all the subtle color changes it was going through. I knew the part where the bass really kicks in was coming up so I decided to lie down for it. As my back hit the ground the music kicked in. This was the first time I had seen the night sky.
