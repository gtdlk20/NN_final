We were just sort of sitting there on the bench, not really saying much, straight chilling, and as we did so my mood continued to get better and better.  Pretty soon, I was actually feeling better than baseline Â– I was feeling really great!  A big stupid smile took over my face as I just sat there on the bench and let the sun shine on me. A big stupid smile took over my face as I just sat there on the bench and let the sun shine on me.  I began to feel a rush inside of me, exhilarating, like a pent up energy.  I don't remember exactly how the thought came into my mind but I remember I started to explain, with great enthusiasm and euphoria alike, to Arthur how the meaning of life is whatever you want it to be.  For some reason, this terse kernel of knowledge excited and uplifted me so much.  It felt so simple and intuitive, and I couldn't believe that there were people who asked themselves what the meaning of life was and wondered about the point.  The point is whatever you want! I thought to myself.  It's completely up to you!  If you think the point of life is to travel the world then the point is to travel the world and if you think the point of life is to eat as much cheese as possible then that's the point of life, to eat as much cheese as possible (I thought exactly this).  It was so beautifully simple.  It was perfect, and I know it's true.
