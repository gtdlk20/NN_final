Summer Thoughts: "This is when everything started going downhill for me. When the cat was acting weird, it started unnerving me as it always does when Im tripping, but this time it went a little further. Valk tells me Jojo didnt actually do anything hostile, but my fragile sense of reality led to me seeing Jojo come at me like he was literally trying to kill me. My brain was so impressionable, emotional, and easily influenced in that moment that it freaked me the fuck out. I blacked out. Its like when you hear of people getting so angry that they black out and beat the fuck out of someone and finally come to minutes later wondering what happened. Thats how it was for me, but instead of attacking the cat, I was apparently just frantically trying to get him out of the room. What brought me back was Valk holding me telling me to come back and that everything was okay. When I realized that I had lost control of myself, this sent me into a negative thought loop for hours. I was so terrified that I was going to lose control again and hurt myself somehow, and I just couldnt get over it."
