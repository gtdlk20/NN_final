By this time, I was growing tired of the paranoia and feeling like I should be hiding from people. If I had known about a small deck I found the next day I could have gone there and no one else would have been around. So, a little after midnite I think it was, I attempted to go back to my cabin. However, this wasn't as easy as it should have been. I entered into the atrium, knowing it was possible to get to my cabin from there, but not quite sure how. I felt like everyone was looking at me, and I probably looked confused or lost. People were beginning to look ugly. I thought about just asking someone for help, which would have been a bad idea. I eventually found the hallway that lead to my room and proceded down it. I felt like I should say 'I'm glad we had this little talk' to the universe. I had come up with the idea of Life being a challenge, and god being the thing that gives the challenge. I've dismissed the latter idea as foolishness since I'm atheistic. But anyway, In the hallway I passed a blonde girl that smiled. I remember thinking 'You are Americana, I want to exist within you.' Whatever the hell that means.
