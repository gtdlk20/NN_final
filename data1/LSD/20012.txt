I took my first dose on the 13th of february at my apartment, approx 80ug (1/3 of a tab) and it didn't do anything as I attempted to redose an hour in to make it kick in. Smoked some weed to help it get going but nothing. I was a bit discouraged. I talked with my dealer and he said I might just be very resistant. I had rolled on MDMA just a few days prior however so we judged that might be why. I was still nervous as could be about taking this low dose.
