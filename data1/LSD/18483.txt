By this time we are all feeling pretty giggly.  We talk, laugh, drink a little more.  S takes a lamp puts a green lightbulb in it and sets it in the corner of the living room, so that it illuminates two walls.  Wow...they are textured so they start forming patterns.  I start seeing very aztec looking forms on the wall.  Snakes, vines, leaves, trees, and skeletons(but not scary).  I could hear the crickets and frogs outside and this added to the hallucination.  I then get up to do something but get distracted by the carpet.  It moves, ebbs and flows.
