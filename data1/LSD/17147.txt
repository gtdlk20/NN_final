- Walking through an alleyway where the brick walls were covered in odd graffiti.  At first, the number 1 was scrawled across a dumpster.  Then, in two separate places, the number 2.  About fifteen seconds farther down the alley, three instances of the number 3 spray painted on the walls.  Four 4's, five 5's etc. on up to 10.  I have since visited the alley in question, and found nary a number painted there.
