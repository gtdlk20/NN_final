So, I just told you what I was experiencing at the moment, and what I was physically doing. Notice how different those episodes and reflections seemed? On acid, progression and synchronicity dont really exist. A thought flows into the other, which flows into the other, and it all melts together in reactions and feelings. So, while this was going on, I still had the were all so small! realization fresh in my mind, which made me cry even more because I saw our reality as perfect, as little, as functional - when compared to the space and solar system. Because no matter small, it was still all love and beauty.
