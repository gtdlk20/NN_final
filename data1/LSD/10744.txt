This is the 4th high dose trip Ive had in 5 weeks. I have not written trip reports for 2 of the other ones unfortunately so there is a big gap to where I was before and where I am now. My setting is that of my condo in the woods. A private place with electricity, running water, a computer with good music, eyeshades, art-supplies, and most importantly PRIVACY!
