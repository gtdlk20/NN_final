They were seriously plowing the shit out of each other right there on that main road in the car. I mean it was the middle of the night and no one was really around but come on cant you find a better place to fuck than that? Youre not even that far from the entrance of 7/11 which is a place that is open 24/7. That was crazy and weird seeing that and we were cracking up hysterically but also confused because we didnt understand what was going on and why they were wearing clothes but still somehow having sex? It was still very dark out and we head up this hill past these apartments and we come by and pass the lake. We were on the same side of the street as the lake even though when walking by we usually arent because that side of the street tends to be sketchy but we just felt so carefree. We were still deep in the trip btw. It may sound like enough things had happened already that we would be sober by now but there would still be HOURS of tripping left. We werent finished by a long shot. Anyways as we pass the lake and walk by we look at it and eventually we come to the middle and have a middle view of the whole lake and can see the docks with the boats on it. And the orange lights shining on the dock were shining and reflecting on the dark black water and it looked soamazing and breathtaking. We had to just stop walking and stare for about 5 minutes it was one of the most beautiful things we had ever seen for some reason and we just kept saying wowwow. It seemed so beautiful and captivating for some reason and the water just looked gorgeous.
