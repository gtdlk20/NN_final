I started looking at some Sandman comic book called 'Dream Hunters' and was marvelling at this Japanese artist's watercolor/hand-drawn art in it and then I turned on my laptop and started playing around with that Fractint program for a bit (the whole trip I was seeing MAD fractals every time I closed my eyes. Fractal OD!) I started reading some stuff I'd written that was on my computer and was disappointed I hadn't finished one of my longer poems, but reading it was fun because I didn't remember any of it. It was as if someone else had  written it and I was reading it for the first time. Shortly after this I had a phrase come into my head.....my quote of the day: 'The universe loves AHA's!'
