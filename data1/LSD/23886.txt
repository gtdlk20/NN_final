It was summertime, and a few friends and myself were at a music festival in the appalachian mountains. I had used lsd and mushrooms several times in the past, and enjoyed the experiences. We found a campsite, set up our tents, and proceeded to make a few puchases. I found a ten-strip of what the girl described to be really good hits. I walked back to the campsite, and ingested three of them. I sat back and relaxed, as was my normal pre-trip ritual.
