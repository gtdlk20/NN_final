Thats when we realized that there was no going back, that after this experience, we would have been bonded for life. It wasnt just about dropping, and experimenting, with friends anymore. It was about acquiring a new, elevated connection, with each other. I loved them; probably more than I loved my thoughts - and they became my thoughts, as the force of their love and attachment overcame me. I loved love, and I loved to love. So much love.
