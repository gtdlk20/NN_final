All in all, a breathtaking experience. Demonstrated an awful lot to me. First of all, set and setting is as important as Leary always said it was. I doubt I'll ever do acid in such a social environment again, there's just too much stimulae and room for too much to go wrong. As soon as I was rescued, the fear went and the following 6 or 7 hours were the most enjoyable of my life. Lastly, doing as much as I did is probably inadvisable. I had tripped only a couple of times before the above events took place, I don't think I was ready for such a large dose. I've tripped a bunch of times since and generally only take a couple of drops at most and still have a great time. I also felt fucking horrible for days afterwards. I didn't stop having visuals until about 24 hours after dosing, and the comedown lasted days.
