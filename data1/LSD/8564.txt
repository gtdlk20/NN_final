As soon as we finished eating we jumped in the pool to relax. S insisted in taking my surfboard in the pool so I couldnt tell her no. We paddled around in the flattest ocean you will ever surf in and I tried teaching her how to duck dive, which she almost got (She at least learned how to sit on the board). After a great day we dried off and I took her home.
