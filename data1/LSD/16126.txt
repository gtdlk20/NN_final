The third hour to the 5th hour is where it all began to go wrong for Matt, but was the most intense part of my entire evening, and most visual. We started the trek back to Matt's house about 25 minutes from the discount store. The drive was difficult and intense. The road would not maintain shape or perception, it altered constantly from being wide and short to long and narrow. The surrounding trees grew taller with the long narrow roads, and fat and colorful with the wide short ones. Stop signs changed there consistent shape, passing cars reminded me only of the cars in the animated classic Roger the Rabbit movie with their flowing shapes and inflatable appearance. We arrived at Matt's house where I could hardly park my car reasonably.
