I love looking at myself on psychedelics, because I used to be dysmorphic and find that psychedelics fix this. I love looking at myself on psychedelics, because I used to be dysmorphic and find that psychedelics fix this. What used to look ugly, fat, too awful to go outside (and more specifically, as dysmorphia usually goes: the angles of the eyebrows far too harsh so as to make me look evil, small skin imperfections so huge I can't see anything else, small things too hideously big and big things too hideously small, and nothing special, graceful, right). The effect is not permanent, but can last weeks before I start to hate my body and feel I need to hide it again.
