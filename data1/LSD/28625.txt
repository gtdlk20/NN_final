I'd sworn to myself I'd never try Psychedelics, and, most probably, I won't do them again seeing as I've tripped around 10 times, but I've decided to share, for those looking to try Acid, my Acid experience which was almost indescribably beautiful.  Sometime this past February (2005) I was able to find a sheet of Acid with some friends, and after selling most of it off, I reserved about 5 hits to myself.  The night I had it, I decided, though only having done Acid once before (and only 1 hit) to take a large dose--3 hits.  It was supposedly quite powerful, and, as you'll read in a moment, I, at the very least, thought it was.
