We all got in the car and drove back into town. This is where I think I've heard the most utterly insane thing ever spoken. Jim was in the back seat and said 'Hey guys, I have something really important to say.' Wally and I turn around to hear what he will say. Jim says 'Scooby Doo makes me cry' with a totally straight face. Wally and I crack up for the longest time. Jim didn't even know he said it. He told us what he meant to say but it was never remembered.
