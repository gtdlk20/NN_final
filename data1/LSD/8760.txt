That aside, this was my second time doing acid. Far from my first experience with drugs though. Over the previous 2 years I had smoked a lot of weed of course, done copious amounts of DXM, DPH and LSA and had done other one-off encounters with salvia, speed, MDMA, Xanax and some painkillers. I considered myself pretty experienced with drugs and at that point impervious to a bad trip, taking into account all the DPH Ive done and all the bad highs Id gotten. The first time I did acid on a school night, alone in my room, and while it was fun I dont think I truly experienced the acid experience. After looking for it again for a year, my dealer-good friend of mine told me that within the next week shed get some LSD and that Im more than welcome to take it with her and her friends. As nice as this was, I dont think I wouldve felt the safest tripping with her Russian skinhead drug dealing muscly boyfriend and his friends. Nice guys and all, but Im sure acid wouldve said otherwise. I asked her if I could buy 8 tabs for me and my friends instead, who havent previously done acid and she said shell see what she can do.
