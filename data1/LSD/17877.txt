Finally as the trip began to mellow out and exhaustion began to overwhelm us after everything we experienced, we ended up just chilling for awhile, watching anime, listening to music with our Subpac, messaging friends on discord and etc. Just trying to unwind and decompress a little bit. Visuals were still there but less apparent, noticeable but no longer overwhelming. Eventually we ended up going to the bedroom, got in bed together, held each other and finished our trip together, finally falling asleep.
