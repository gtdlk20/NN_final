Last summer, I was 20 years old. My friend and I road-tripped a week down to my other friend, who got us the acid. The three of us dropped together, and kept up such a strong positive vibe the whole time. Since then, I listen to music better. I 'get' it now. Music is the purest expression of the existence each of us manifests, and I had to take LSD to realize how to enjoy that.
