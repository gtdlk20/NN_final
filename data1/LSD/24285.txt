So I'm driving around and we decide to stop and get hats for our adventure. Where do we go? A gas station of course. We were so out of it that for at least 5 minutes we looked in the cooler where the sodas were thinking that hats were there. We then looked at each other and said 'there's no hats in a cooler' and laughed like crazy. I'm sure everyone thought we were nuts, and we were.
