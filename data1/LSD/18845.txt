I sat back up and realized that Sven has been a little quite. Right after me noticing that my buddy was being a little quite I noticed that red line on the ceiling of the tent again. That red line distracted me. I looked at this line and noticed that the red inside the line started forming what kind of looked like D.N.A. As I was completely staring at the line I listened to Sven and Ole talk. Sven was getting a little worried about the tent and it not being waterproof. I told him not to worry. I had no reason to give why he shouldnt worry but at this time I was too enthralled by the red line and honestly didnt at all care about the rain. Ole assured Sven that it would be alright and he should calm down. Sven then said no its not, its not alright. At this point t was obvious that Sven was having a bad trip.
