On the drive home, we talk about God and we listen to mewithoutYou. The scenery is beautiful, the colors still so vibrant. I doze off here and there, but the energy is still humming in my body. When we get home, I read William Blakes The Marriage of Heaven and Hell out loud as Ryan cleans up some pocket knives he bought from an antique store. Im struck by some of the images, so close to how I felt on the trip. One stuck with me, a proverb from hell: Eternity is in love with the productions of time.
