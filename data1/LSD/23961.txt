It was marvelous.  We observed the nature there... bugs and birds, all kinds of plants around us, and the smell, the feeling, taste of the fresh morning air.  Everything we could sense simply came to us naturally, just like it's supposed to. We didn't have to listen for sounds or look to see.  Just being aware and present in the Here and Now, a most fundamental part of life, became ecstatic and without any certain drive to do so for some meaningful purpose.  It was a lot like dancing.  For the first time since we were children, we were alive.  Brightly, blissfully, being.
