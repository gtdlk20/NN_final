The LSD came on stronger and faster than I had ever experienced. Usually I wait about two hours, wondering if I got ripped off. This time I ate very little in preparation, and by the 25 minute mark things were seriously near the overwhelming point. The white walls became trillions of colors with a repeating pattern that looked like the symbol for a cold front over and over again. I have only gotten sick on acid once before, but the intensity of the come up left me curled up on my bed with my face in the comforter, rolling around to try to stave off the nausea. Im sure some out there know what I am talking about- its no normal nausea, its inconsistent and comes in rapid waves. What was initially an ecstatic mood at getting what seemed to be excellent acid turned into fear- this was coming on way too strong, way too fast. I remember lying on my bed looking at the different sized whirlpools swirling in the drywall and thinking Just hold on, motherfucker! For some reason I kept conceptualizing the amount of time I had been waiting for this trip, and it seemed to be a very tangible amount of days bathed in this dreary sunset light and it made me feel unbearably depressed so I tried to banish it from my mind.
