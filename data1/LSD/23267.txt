I then realised that I couldn't take it anymore so I stood up, told my teacher that I felt very 'ill' and that I was going. She told me it was OK to step outside and get some fresh air. I then told her that I was not coming back and that I was going home. I picked up all my stuff and as I was about to leave someone in class made a joke. He said something along the lines of 'You smoked too much crack last night'. When I heard this I suddenly thought 'Oh my god, they're very close to finding out the truth'. With this in my mind I laughed in a very uneasy way to pretend like that was absolutely not the case.
