Breathe and my eyes were burning! In my deep, astral-travelling bliss, I had inadvertently dropped my cigarette into Drew's clothes hamper. It had been smoldering for quite some time. Drew was screaming at me telling me to wake up, there was a fire! I had started it! The house was on fire at 2:00 o'clock in the morning, we were tripping hard on acid, and it was ALL MY FAULT! As we were trying to figure out what to do next, and making a lot of noise, Drew's mother opened the door and walked in. She gave us both a funny look and said, 'Put the fire out and try not to make so much noise' and then she went back to bed.
