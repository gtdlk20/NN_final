The beginning was coming quickly and powerfully, significantly moreso than usual. This caused me a great deal of anxiety, as I began to realize I had taken a much larger dose than expected. I've had experience with large doses, but nothing ever felt as overwhelming as this. I became violently sick, and became stuck in a loop of vomiting for almost an hour, before finally being well enough to go back to bed. The only thing tethering me to reality was the horrible nausea, and the fact that I was breathing. All I could do without gagging was hunch over the toilet and breath. The sound of my breath took on an extremely vibrant quality, and made the time sick pass more interestingly. My only other thoughts were of disappointment at myself for jumping into the void haphazardly.
