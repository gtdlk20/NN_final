Id just like to say that this was a LONG trip. I took 1 tab, and about 9 hours into that I had another, effectively having 2 consecutive trips. Then there was the long long come down. By the end of it I hadnt slept in 28 hours and was just fried mentally and physically. So, excuse me if this report is a bit long, but I dont feel my trip is justified enough without the detail.
