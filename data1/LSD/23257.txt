My brother came home shortly after, I was pretending to be alseep, it worked and he climbed into bed without bothering me. I was very hot, sweating. I couldn't sleep and I kept looking at the time. I was lying there concentrating on falling sleep. I kept looking at the time every 5 minutes. Each 5 minutes that past felt like 15 minutes so I was lying in bed for what felt like eternity. It was now coming towards 6 and I kept on thinking, 'Omg, I have school tomorrow and I havenÂ’t had any sleep yet. Let me at least get 1 hour of sleep'.
