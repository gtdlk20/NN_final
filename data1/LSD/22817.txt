We made it to the psytrance zone. We sat on a fence, and laughed at the what we called 'Mushroom Heads' who were attempting to dance to psytrance, but looked more like they were just swinging their arms slowly. Usually, I enjoy psytrance when I am sober, but the state of mind I was in, I would rather of taken the piss out of everything and anything not related to drum and bass.
