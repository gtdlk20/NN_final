We got back inside the house and David, Daniel, and Kevin decided to go to bed. That was when Sean and me started peaking. My mind felt like it had million of questions, statements, thoughts, images, and colors racing threw it all at the same time. I found very simple things to be very amusing. Like staring at the ceiling, watching T.V., or playing with a cigarette. Sean had a pair a glow sticks and he soon began to wavy them around in different patterns and shapes. I found it very fascinating to look at them. Time only seemed to creep by. I remembered that Franz had also taken two hits and that he had to work the next day at eight in the morning. I didn't call him because I was so paranoid from the acid.
