I was tripping so hard at this point that it's very difficult to maintain a coherent narrative. I remember the music we were listening to--first Make Believe (the band, not Weezer's latest disappointment), then some 80's mix which gloriously featured both 'Come on Eileen' and 'Enjoy the Silence'; and finally--flawlessly--Crystal Method. Perfect. It was one hell of a drive, and I can remember pretty much every specific--but nothing ties them together, so I can't maintain a readable narrative if I go into them.
