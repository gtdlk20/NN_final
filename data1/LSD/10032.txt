Looking back on it I have many memories of what I felt, but at the time I was lost in a place where there was no up, down, left right, sight, sound, scent.  I tested this new world to see if there was pain, because I remembered pain, and I tested it by reaching out a grabbing briars with my hand.  As the thorns dug into my hand I remember laughing because it wasn't at all painful but rather ecstatic!  Thousands of colors shot outwards from where my hand contacted the thorns!  My senses had blurred togethter fully and I felt that I was invincible.
