The setting was a very large psytrance festival in Europe. Nearly 30,000 brave souls had gathered for 5 days in a beautiful setting on the shores of a lake. The festival featured a huge psychedelic temple, fire dancers from four continents, amazing multi-story light shows and art instillations, lazers that bounced off the clouds, and a troupe of stilt walkers with extremely intricate costumes who I made friends with the very first night. For four days and nights I had been partying hard. In the previous 48 hours I had consumed mushrooms, LSD, peyote, MDMA, MDA, 2CI, 2Cb, 2CT7, 5-meo-DMT, and Ayahuasca (the Ayahuasca wasn't that strong, everything else was stronger than I had ever had).
