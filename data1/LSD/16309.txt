Once I hit my mid-teens and drug experimentation became a real possibility, I tried to find acid, but couldn't--it is very difficult to obtain in my area, especially without a network of certain kinds of connections. So, long story short, by the time I was twenty-one, I had long since taken up smoking cigarettes, used marijuana on a fairly regular basis, had discovered and waved good-bye to alcohol, and experimented with ecstasy and cocaine--but I had yet to try that one substance whose reputation originally interested me in this whole drug thing.
