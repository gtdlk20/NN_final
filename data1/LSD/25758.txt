Pete and co. Went in the chippy while me jack and dave waited outside, jack started staring at a nokia mobile advertisment on the wall, the one with the ketchup seemingly sprayed all round the edges of it. The first thing I thought was 'fuck me theres a girl in that wall and shes covered in sauce, no it cant be it is! Its actual sauce on that there wall' I went in close and had a real good look, nope its just and advertisement but the light its emmiting is the dopest thing I've ever seen. By this time pete had been in the chip shop for what seemed like hours and was cracking up at our antics outside, we left eventually and made our way back to the house, by this time I felt the acid getting stronger and stronger, I found myself on a sofa in the house attempting to get a cigarette from my packet, it took goddamn hours and I wondered if I was just stupid, this was the simplest task ever and I found myself to be incapable of performing it! This sent me off on tangents, did I do well at school? Did my mum bring me up well enough? Why cant I do this? Whats wrong with me? Oh shit...reality flashback, I had to tell myself that I felt like this because of the drugs I had ingested, then everything became a hellava lot clearer. 'Hold on, I dont have to worry about this, I can control whats happning, I just have to realise it' this got me thinking about how the drug was working in my brain,
