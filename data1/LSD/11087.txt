Along the path, as we passed by a few other students smoking bowls, I noticed how good I physically felt compared to just about every other psychedelic. My stomach felt a bit tight, but not to the point where it became a distraction. Otherwise, I felt like I was walking on air. We got down to the boathouse and walked out on to the floating segmented dock. We all laid down on the dock and felt the waves below us. I felt like I was melting in to the water as I closed my eyes and enjoyed the serenity of it all. With my eyes closed, complex psychedelic visual stories took place. With my eyes open, the stars above would dart about freely in the night sky. We spent a good amount of time sitting out by the boathouse enjoying the warm breeze blowing over the water. I sat there with S resting her head on my lap, and she looked absolutely beautiful. After a few moments though, her face began to morph into some frightening and contorted distortions. Inside of each of her eyes was a burning fire. I wondered what it meant, but decided not to dwell on it.
