I also forgot to mention that every time me and my tripping friend looked at our phones it looked completely strange and fake just like all other technology. Thats how we could instantly tell if we were tripping or not. Either by looking at your hand or the screen of your cell phone. Eventually we went in his living room. Me and my tripping friend were just watching whatever was on T.V. flipping through channels intrigued by how different and bright and I guess fake and corky everything on T.V. looked. I think that girls party was still booming loudly but anyways this weird trippy way everything on T.V. looked reminded us of our old shroom trips so this was exciting for us and we started just giggling at everything and we were just really happy. My Russian friend was kind of just all over the place calling people on the phone, doing things around the house, arguing with his mom in Russian and doing weed related business. I guess he was buying a pretty big weed sac and it was supposed to be kept secret but I didnt understand why. My other friend kept forgetting this and accidentally kept bringing it up when we were in the dining room before when my Russian friend's mom was still around but still it wasnt something that we were used to because we could usually bring up weed around his mom all the time.
