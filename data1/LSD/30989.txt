Yeah, I dont know. Its not like Im not feeling it, just not really anything too intense. Im not affected by it. Summer said. I connected the dots, and realized that Summer had probably lamented not being high, while I was still in the shower. I related to that, since it was just what Id been thinking of, but things were about to change. Plus, quite frankly, Summer has a high tolerance when it comes to substances, albeit being even a couple of pounds less than me, and roughly the same height. I knew my girl, and I knew that merely half a blotter wasnt going to, necessarily, be life-altering for her.
