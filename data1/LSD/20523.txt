Anyways I was just feeling this real crazy deep DEEP connective feelings and the whole canyon took on an even more exotic and eerie vibe. More mystical I guess. That deep akashic revelation or experience somehow really changed weed and alcohol for me too. Especially hash. And ESPECIALLY edibles. During this time I felt like I could feel and almost hear the echoes of all those hippies and acid freaks from the LSD realm infecting and spreading out through the whole canyon and all the trees and plants. Things seemed really cold, dark and mystical.
