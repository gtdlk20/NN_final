We each take one tab at 5:30pm, as soon as I get back from paying for the campsite. Its our first time tripping with just us alone, and the third altogether. Weve had a short honeymoon, just a road trip down to the Redwoods and Crater Lake. Its been a long summer with the preparations for our wedding. Small as it was, only forty-five people, it was quite an ordeal. Over the last few days, Ive loved our time to relax together, and now Im totally ready to explore acid with just us.
