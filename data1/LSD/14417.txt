The idea of recording our experience in a series of quotes is born. While walking past an artificial plant Connor lifts it from the ground and spins in a circle, enthusiastically stating that he could 'dance one million plants'. I am in the bathroom peeing, it is beautiful, a stark white with a small green plant on the toilet bowl and a recessed light shining down on it. Ted approaches me from behind and requests a 'non-gay size comparison'. I turn him down and go about my business. Prior to this I had experience with LSD and others having bad trips but was not well versed and researched. We noticed Ted staring into the mirror, unaware of the danger this posed, we let it happen.
