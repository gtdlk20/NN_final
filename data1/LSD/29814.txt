12:30- All of the sudden, I wanted a cigarette. So I went outside and, holy shit, it was in-fucking-credible! I had complete night-vision and saw everything. The starlight all blended together to form a neon blue and yellow sky filled with patterns, flowers, smiley faces, and peace signs. They were all flowing around in the sky like there was a current. The moon was covered in geometric shapes and suddenly exploded into a flower with a super peace sign in the middle. A yellow brick road opened up in the sky and beckoned me to continue on my journey. I lit my smoke up and called my friend D up since he had tried it for the first time recently as well. He was totally baked at some party and I ended up talking to like 10 people I didnt know. I was trying to explain what I was experiencing but with little effect. I could barely talk!
