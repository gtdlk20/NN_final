I began playing Sgt. Peppers, and when I reached Lovely Rita, it seemed like I lost my ego. I am unsure exactly, but I forgot that I took a drug. I just felt like I was the only person in the entire universe who did not feel "normal", and this is I believe the worst part about tripping alone.  I felt so far-out of myself, I could not relate to my surroundings in the cozy way I had all my life. I was very familiar with the surroundings I was in, but I felt disconnected I was very familiar with the surroundings I was in, but I felt disconnected, and vivaciously nauseous the entire trip. I am sure my empty stomach and low blood sugar did not help me enjoy my trip.
