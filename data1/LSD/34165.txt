I have made an explanation to my self about this.  How scientifically sound it is I don't know.  I know lighter eyes let more light in them.  So on my journey I believe I interfaced so much with so much light(truth) that my eye color adapted to that frequency of learning on that level.  As far as set and setting, the universes I birthed there was me pissing my self here, I ended up hanging out with rock med.  I would not trade my experience for ANYTHING.  I also woundn't take such a high dosage of any thing in a festival setting with out someplace to go where you can let it all out if need be.  It is important to have acess to a space on this demension that can haddle your body mimicking what is going on in other demensions you may be traveling. I use this and all other alternative reality experiences every day to further the study of self.
