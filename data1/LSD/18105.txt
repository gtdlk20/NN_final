The first hour was the scariest hour of my lifetime...I though I was going to stay crazy for ever and it really was scary. After about an hour and peaking and being scared out of my mind, seeing everything from a different view I started to understand what was going on. It sort of clicked in my head after being told about 100 times that we wer eon LSD. I finaly got a grip on reality. I knew we were only tripping.
