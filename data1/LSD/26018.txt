After I left there at 4 am (dropped the acid at 12:30), I was peaking I think. Walls looked like they were just kind of rippling slowly, breathing, doorcracks would breathe. I left and went back to my buddy's house. My other friend had tripped too that night, but I didn't see him. At his house I lit up and saw tracers galore. It was amazing...the whole experience. I didn't get to sleep 'til 8 this morning and that was after I smoked 4 more bowls by myself.
