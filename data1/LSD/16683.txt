Nobody had a light and the terrain was rocky so Jess and I walked together, talking happily and catching eachother as we would trip on unseen objects.  We again felt like little kids, always getting behind, laughing, and asking somewhat pointless questions.  Ocassional patches of sand were incredibly strange sensations.  In the darkness every large rock seemed like a curled up human.  I could hear footsteps behind and in front of me, making it seem like I was part of an invisible, moving crowd.
