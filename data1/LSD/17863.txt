One thing that happened to me during this point in the trip is I was having a hard time keeping myself from tempting fate in the sense that I wanted to purposely fall down that previously mentioned sinkhole, or something like that, and see where it would lead me. Like I wanted to go out into the dark of the living room with the lights off, me tripping BALLS, and see what I saw: both mentally and visually. Let my mind free, let it take me wherever it wanted, and letting my brain manifest whatever it wanted me to see/hear/smell/touch.
