So there I was, tripping BALLS, and watching Blue Collar Comedy (which I fucking hate) while sitting next to some buds. At this point I began to feel very sick, but I stayed on the couch. This is when the visuals truely began. I looked at the couch I was sitting on and it suddenly became not just a small 5 foot couch, but 10 miles of couch. The entire room I was in expanded to the size of an airplane hanger, while I remained small. 'I don't feel so good' I said and made my way to the bathroom. After urinating for about a minute I looked in the mirror. What I saw may have been the most terrifying thing I've ever seen in my whole life. It was me, but as an old man. Somehow I knew I had had a dissapointing life and knew death was inescapable. My flesh was wrinkled and I wanted nothing more then another person to be with.
