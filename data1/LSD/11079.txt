Somehow we ended up outside behind the house, slowly getting back on our way. S was tripping hard (and looked absolutely beautiful), T thought he had broken his sweatshirt and was in tears, and W was cracking up at the halarity of it all. I still had only taken one bite of my Butterfinger. I asked S to hold it for me. After I gave it to her I said 'That Butterfinger had become a burden.' Apparently this the was the most halarious thing any of us had ever heard because the whole campus could have heard us all laughing behind the house for a solid five minutes.
