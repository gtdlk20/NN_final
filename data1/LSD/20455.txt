Anyways sorry about this next part of the trip because it might be mixed up or out of order because this is when I started really losing concept of time. Not just losing concept of time but time got all jumbled together and mixed up and dont worry Ill explain. This also happened a long time ago, almost 2 years now since this trip. This trip happened in July or August of 2014 and it is now April of 2016. So my memory isnt perfect.
