No sleep was to be had this evening so a roommate and I went back to the park. We found a corner with benches that was in sand. We began to trace the patterns that we were seeing into the sand. We covered an entire area with these patterns, then moved onto larger sculptures. We spent about an hour creating a tree figure with a face and branches that ran out in all directions. It felt great to channel some of the creative energy of the acid trip into a physical manifestation of that creativity. The entire thing was about 7 feet long and was worth every second we spent on it. It was approximately 2:30 am when we made it back to the apartment again. The rest of my morning was spent relaxing and watching the fading signs of my trip appearing on walls.
