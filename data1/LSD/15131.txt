In closing, it is difficult to relate the nature of really any sort of psychedelic trip and Ive left a lot out that I knew Id never be able to describe. I hope anyone looking to do psychedelics does so for creative inspiration and makes use out of the unexpected results that often come from trips. It is now a week after the trip and I still feel the expanded mind that I had felt in the first hour. My dreams have become more vivid, I feel connected to the people around me in a way I didnt think was possible, and I am planning on moving out of my fathers house as Ive realized what I need. Its the love on that deep felt level that counts, and when that goes missing, ego controls motivations and life becomes a dreary place indeed.
