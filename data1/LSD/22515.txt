When we left I told him that we had to leave because the people in the apartment were trying to screw with me. As per the normal acid-induced panic I had what felt like a million thoughts and questions flashing through my mind every second. I was feeling overwhelmed by the number of thoughts going through my mind. I felt like I was going crazy and that I was never going to be normal again. I couldn't tell whether my paranoia was justified. I also began trying to figure out whether I was shaking or not and was panicked by the fact that I couldn't figure out if I was actually shaking. After we left, we walked to my buddies house and sat in his basement bedroom. He turned the lights out, flicked on the lava lamp and turned on My Friends by the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. After 15 to 20 minutes of sitting in the dark watching the lava lamp, after having left the apartment about 40 minutes earlier, I began to chill the hell out.
