As we were about the leave the peak set in, three of us got in his car (me in the back) and he started driving. It was night and everything was dark, but it felt as if I was running very very fast or flying through the air because my window was open. It was one of the best feelings of my life, it felt like flying at high speeds or just cruising beyond my body. Since I was tripping so hard I didn't get any motion sickness for the most part, I was too busy looking around and phasing into different realities. I found that transitioning from being in one room or place or even looking at one spot to another felt like a significant change in the world and reality and everything.

I forgot I was in my friends car and on the floor in the back there is a raised section behind the middle console, I started stroking it and praising it, thinking it was my mate's dog. My mates both laughed at me very hard.
