And, like that, we drifted into another dimension. We painted our cheeks, our bellies, our chests, our legs, our arms... and it was beautiful. I wouldnt say that for me and Summer it was as liberating as it must have been for Dianna, who is much more connected to painting than us. Yet, it was something filled with beauty. We were in a daze of colors and easygoing uneasiness - it was weird, but it was okay! Thats when the perception of time went out of the window. I frankly dont remember for how long we painted each other for, but it was like a sacred ritual, so it was worthy of being timeless.
