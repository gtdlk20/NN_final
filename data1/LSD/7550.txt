So after we had watched Cartoon Network for a while, I was miserable and very anxious in every sense, as I have already said.  During the period when we were in my dorm room, Arthur had also frequently mentioned his sense of unease to me as well, so we were both feeling similarly.  At some point he suggested that we should step outside for some fresh air.  I happily agreed and we went downstairs to go sit outside near this cool little gazebo in the middle of my residence area.  Almost instantly after we had left my building, my mood began to improve.  I especially enjoyed the sun, which was out and shining brightly, and it brought my mood up in a way I can't really describe.
