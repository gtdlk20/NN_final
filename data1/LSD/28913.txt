We take the tabs in my friends jamies car and realized that we had no where to trip at and we didnt not have enough gas to be just driving around. We decided to go to some tunnels inside of a gulf course near D's house. Jamie parks the car and I see my friend Rob get out with a huge backpack. Not asking anything we proceeded into the small opening in the middle of the course.
