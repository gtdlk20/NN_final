one may live for as long as a human can live, perhaps forver, and their life may seem at the instant that they obtain 'standstillesness' perfect, but the next thing to happen may appear as the fire coming from the center of the earth, but for this one eternal man, it will not harm him, what may in the beginning seem as walls of 'fire' coming in from every directions may in time subside, and what seems so extreme at one point, when time is extended it is merely a disruption on the surface, a ripple in another pond, the flame wavering in someone elses wind we can do as many reality checks as we want, but the truth as it may be, is that all things are eternal, and in one sense, every event is intertwined, as to how is beyond this document, it can not be explained in any document, as it can be taken on any tangent, any possible explanation can be explored, but there is always some where furhter.
