And the fact that theres so much art in here! Dianna added, I just, I just think this is what Im meant to be doing, you know? Like all of this art is my calling... all of this art and love. I would have spoken, but articulating a response took too much effort. (Honestly, I probably did, I just cannot remember what I said... I cannot remember how this particular conversation went, sadly, so Im probably paraphrasing what exactly was said. I remember that I just kept going on and on about feelings, while Dianna expanded upon her affinities with art).
