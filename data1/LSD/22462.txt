I was the first to come up. As I was coming up on the acid, a large group of 100 primary school children came walking through the gardens on some kind of school excursion. I had fond memories of school excursions to the gardens as a child and found this to be quite a loopy thought  evidently; Lucys effects were starting to kick in. I watched the children roll down the hill with so much energy and light-heartedness. I felt children did not need acid, but I needed acid to get back to mind of a child even for just a few hours.
