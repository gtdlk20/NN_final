What was amazing was standing in my kitchen watching the videos, and time would go in slow motion to where I wondered if my DVD had burned wrong or if I was just tripping.  So then I thought about it and I watched it speed back up to normal.  Once it got there, I decided I liked the slow motion better and my mind made it go back.  This was while I was trying to make dinner, which was the most difficult task of the evening by far- I couldnÂ’t coordinate putting the ham in the microwave, taking it out, and putting it on a plate.  Somehow that turned into a 20-step process and I kept getting stuck at step 4.  Looking at my TV and its stand was trippy anyway because the black glass shelves were sort of in a quantum state of superposition- not really in one spot, not really in another.
