Time had passed now and I was staring at a candle to see if anything would happen,and before I knew it the candle started to move and I decided to move to another seat and see what else would trip me out.My focus had slipped onto Justins coffee table,the rings from his coffee mugs had begun to form a stack of skulls,and from that spawned a whole grave yard pulsing different colors.I studied his table for about 20 minutes and decided I would probably have more visuals if I shut my eyes,when I did that all the sounds in the room composed a song with visuals dancing along.After this we decided to have a cigarette.
