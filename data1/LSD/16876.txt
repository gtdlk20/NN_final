The front door of the house opened, and my friend walked out, the one that was referring to his computer as 'god'.  He asked how I was doing and I told him that I had called for a ride.  We had some small talk and I was actually starting to feel a bit more normal.  I was thinking of calling back and canceling my ride... and then a thought came into my head and told me that if I kept partying, I would die.  I shook it off and began to get up, and all the hair on my body stood on end.  My friend looked at me, and asked what was wrong...
