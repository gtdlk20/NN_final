We stoped again at a stone and metal fince.  Some one the metal greating was missing and we sat there on the stone looking at a very pretty man-made pond.  I had my final Epiphany of the day as we discussed my reasons for taking this trip.  I had previously told Entheogen that I was going to do this for what I'd consider spiritual reasons.  I grew up religious and had renounced pretty much anything even vaugely supernatural within this last few years.  But I professed to believe that the 'spiritual' and 'natural' were two sides of the same coin.
