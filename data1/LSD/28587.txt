When I got home my thoughts started getting the better of me. I suddenly realised I couldnt talk to my mum, I was fucked upppppp. I went to bed. I was lying there looking at my clock thinking that this is how I'm going to be for the rest of my life, and mental defect. In the morning my mum would come and speak to me and would realise she had a mental patient for a son. This pattern of thinking lasted a while and then bang! It all stopped, I mean I was still fucked but the intenseness was gone. I woke the next day sweet as.
