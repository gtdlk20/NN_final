The man begins giving instructions after we are seated in the large metal contraption.  He says we have to fasten our seat belts and after fumbling around for a minute or two I finally figured it out.  C remained completely oblivious to all instructions.  A man came up to C and said please fasten your seat belt and pull on it.  C said nothing and continued staring forward in a stupor.  Confused the man just ignored C and cleared us to go.  C looks over me and says 'Oh, were we supposed to do something?'
