So, then late on the friday-evening I took the blotter from my fridge and put it first under my tongue and then after about 15 minutes, chewed it up and swallowed the rest of it. Mum was in her study and asked me to come there because she wanted to show me some beautiful picture of a cat-eye shape nebulae which was very amazing in the way how it actually looked like a cat's eye. We chatted something with her and I went back to my room and sat in front of my computer and listened to some music, goa-trance from mid 90's. I had decided to give a good listen to my favourite recordings when I was tripping. I drank a couple of beers when waiting for the onset.
