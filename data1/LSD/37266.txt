It was a normal night, I was partying over at my buddy's house and we were rockin pretty hard.  Rounds and rounds of quarters and anchorman.  Lots and lots of beer and wine, plus a dance party.  This went on until about 1 am and we decided we needed more alcohol so we went to go get more.  We left with a couple of people I didn't really know well but one of them yelled out, 'Let's go get my acid!' and my eyes lit up.  I've had quite a few amazing trips from acid and it treated me well so I was down.
