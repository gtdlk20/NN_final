The night started off quite regularly. I had been riding in a beaten-up Mazda for several hours with my friend (let's call him Lex) trying to find the equipment to satisfy our plans for the day. The idea was: we'd have black lights galore, tons of rave toys to entertain ourselves with, ten hits of acid (naturally), and a few drug-driven movies to watch.
