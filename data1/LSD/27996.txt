In the blackness of the sky I saw something that will probably be the most difficult thing to describe in this passage. The image was like a complex geometric pattern of cubes. The cubes were not stacked flat, but were set up so that they had one corner pointing directly towards the earth. Every side of the cubes showed the same design, a design which changed constantly. The design had tessalations of Japanime in it, constantly changing the subject face. I split after seeing enough of the sky show and listening to Meddle.
