The second time I tripped, it was with my friend, and boyfriend at the time; we'll call him J. It was way more intense than the first time, but I felt worse after I came down. We got the acid from another friend and took it at her house at about 8pm. J and I were with a third friend, W, who wasn't on anything that night. We were driving out to J's house and we picked up some fast food on the way and ate in an empty parking lot near J's house. While they were eating I started feeling the acid. I felt tingly all over, and then it felt like when your foot falls asleep, but all over my body. J and W walked around the parking lot smoking a cigarette and I stayed in the car because I was cold. I was looking at the car seat and it looked like it was breathing, very gently.
