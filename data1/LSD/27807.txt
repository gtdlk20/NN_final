In the brain, there are various closets and broom cupboards and unswept corners and attics. One can get into quite a cleaning frenzy, opening up old trunks and so on. Typically what I found was cliches and habits and instinctual behavior. All the ingredients of personality. I found that 'reaching' physically and 'reaching' in the mind are the same. All the time on acid I find myself reaching with my right arm for things, especially my glasses, whenever I want to reassert my intellectual hold on the situation. Now I see why! That's my left brain 'reaching' into the right brain and rummaging around -- that's my way of visualizing the process of connecting unconscious symbols with conscious intellectual ideas. I started to realize what dreaming is... literally, housekeeping. All of that stuff there in the corners exists in symbolic form.
