Me and my buddy both ate two hits and took the train downtown. After about 25 min. I began to feel funny and being sensitive to chemicals sensed the acid taking my to LaLa land quite quickly. We arrived to downtown Chicago, and the day was beautiful, not a single cloud in the sky and the warm sun beating down on us. We were trippin pretty good for about 3 hours, walking around and ddecided to go see a movie, Kung Fu Panda. It was one of the best times ever. Anyways when we got out of the theater the acid seemed to have calmed down and I felt like the trip was coming to an end even though it had been only 5-6 hours into it.
