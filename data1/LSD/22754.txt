For the next hour or two, the five of us listen to music (primarily Jaco Pastorius self-titled album), relax in Steves hot tub, and sit on his back porch admiring nature. At one point, after smoking a Djarum, Steve turns pale and becomes ill. Though I know it isnt his fault, his nausea and general feelings of sickness bring my mood down tremendously. For a while, I develop a new sensitivity to other persons voices, and I find myself seeking solitude. Eventually, Steve vomits and feels much better. After that, my good mood returns and my irritability vanishes.
