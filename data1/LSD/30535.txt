After hours and hours (although it seemed like one single moment in time) of taking in this sensory wellspring, we started communicating in 'caveman' It was decided we'd put the Yes album 'Relayer' into the walkmen and donned our headsets. Immediately, upon hearing 'The Gates of Delirium' the trip took on an unbelievable quality full of energy, plays of shapes, beautiful colors emmanating and radiating off the clouds and dunes. Geometric pattern fired off and filled everything in the visual field. Say what you want about Yes but that album 'Relayer' is perfection when tripping and guides you wonderfully through the psychedelic voyage.
