My subjective cognitive reference point had completely vanished and I was thrown back into infinity... Simultaneously existing in a 3d shell with my mind expanded into the entirety of the fouth dimension. Mentally dead but physically alive. I was still waiting for us to somehow shed our old skins and enter 'thought-world' but I started coming down instead.
