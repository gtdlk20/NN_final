When we got back to my house we decided to make my traditional 'house drink' for Kyle since he wasn't going to be dropping any acid.  Basically, my drink consists of a little bit of everything we have in the liquor cabinet, a pitcher of OJ, and a lot of Peach Schnapps and some pure grain alcohol (195 proof!) that my dad had in the back of the liquor cabinet.  We pour all the alcohol into a pitcher full of OJ and shake really well.  It's surprisingly good, too.  Since my parents were out of town for the weekend, Justin and I were both very relaxed and basically stress-free for the weekend, so we both went into the trip with a positive mind-set.
