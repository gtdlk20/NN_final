IÂ’ve always been a bit of a nihilist, but I never realized how much frustration this could have ended up costing a day-tripper me. I looked at the Keith Haring designs, all of them, and they bothered me because they were so open ended, they meant so much, yet nothing at the same time. The conflict my mind was feeling, in searching for a meaning that was everything and everyone, and nowhere and nobody, simultaneously, made me feel so irritated that I had to engage with humans.
