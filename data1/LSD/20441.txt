Anyways the entity itself was like geometric but very indescribable and like I said vaguely mantoid as oppose to humanoid. Like a geometric vibratory prey mantis God of some sort. It really only showed itself during the chorus of the song when Paul McCartney would say Jai Guru Deva Om'. When the chorus wasnt going it would just be colors but during the chorus and only after this the entity itself would be noticeable and would continue to inject me with universal love and understanding. This is definitely not anywhere close to the average LSD trip which is why Im writing it down. This is an extremely rare experience that probably had largely to do with set and setting and the LSD itself being so pure. Whats crazy is that prior to this night I had never known what Jai Guru Deva Om actually meant and it turns out this phrase is a mantra used in transcendental meditation that is actually supposed to take the mind to higher consciousness. And for me it kind of worked hah or at least appeared to I mean jesus fucking christ.
