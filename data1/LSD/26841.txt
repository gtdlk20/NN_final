12:30: After calling the supplier met up with him in town.  The supplier was with a friend and she showed me what they had.  She was cutiing the pieces with some scissors.  She handed me two little pieces that were about the size of 2/3 of a normal tab.  I asked her if she was serious and she then told me that they had intended to buy a vial, but instead the guy soaked up all the acid from inside where it was made onto three pieces of paper.  Having known her a while, I believed her and went home.
