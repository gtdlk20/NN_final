to date, this is the most intense encounter i have EVER had on acid!!!a real rush, not unlike large doses of speed..after i felt totally cleansed, we walked the streets and into a 24-hour gas station, where we met some old friends. I felt like 5 years old and noted i could see AURAS around everyone!!!I paid for a fizzy dizzy Coke and told the gas attendent, with a huge hug, things will be ok!! (i saw so much RED around him.) he looked at me all puzzled for a few seconds(??!) then  broke into a smile and said thanks.
