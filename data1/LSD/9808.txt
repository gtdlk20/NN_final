The music was unbelievably spellbinding, in a very different way from cannabis.  it was loud and had a 3D sensation, bouncing all around my skull.  But more than that, the sounds seemed to 'mix' with my other senses in the sense that they were at times unrecognizable as sound, but appeared as thoughts, emotions, or just some general cognitive input that I perceived as 'more than just sound.'  The music acquired an insanely dramatic and emotional quality to the point where I was quivering and utterly gripped.  The time dilation was very noticeable - I'd listen for what seemed like forever and realize that the song hadn't changed.
