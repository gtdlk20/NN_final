I stood there for a couple of minutes, trying to remember the sequence of events preceeding the present time.  It was then I remembered I had a few 'Sparklers' in my pocket.  Sparklers are fireworks... you light the end of the long metal stick and sparks spew out of it for about 1 minute.  I pulled a Sparkler out, and lit it.  It took a few seconds to light, but once lit immediately exploded into a rage of sparks intensified by my hallucinations.  As I moved it around my vision, tracers followed it in a very flowy motion, and the path of the sparkler in my vision was revealed until the sparkler went out.  When it went out, my heart was racing.  I was amazed.  I turned around and looked at D and F, who were also left silent by the beautiful display of colors.  I lit a few more, and we smoked another bowl before heading back inside.
