In a strange way it seemed like I had infinite energy, it was around 7.30 in the morning, possibly even later and I was dancing like I couldnt do anything else in the world. It wasnt even me who was dancing, the music was dancing me and had become a part of me. I couldnt refuse the music. Maria did not have the endless energy I had so we decided to go check for the bus times. Together. That would still be another hour away and seeing as we had to wait anyway I convinced her to stay a little longer. Until the end we sat on the block, danced briefly for one more time and around 10 am we finally left the party to go home. At home I still had visuals and thus unavoidable LSD insomnia so it took till far past noon before I finally slept.
