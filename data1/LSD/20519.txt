At one point we were walking over to the edge of the creek because we just wanted to get up and look at the canyon and all the palm trees and nature. The trail was right across and the creek is up high so its kind of like youre standing on a cliff when youre standing on the edge of this creek like we were and since Im tripping on acid and my whole perception of everything is so different and alien I get sort of almost a flashback feeling to one of my early dramatic mushroom trips in 2012 where I was stuck on a mountain at night that had very steep and intimidating cliffs. Kind of gave me slight PTSD but its like the cool kind of PTSD much like those good hangovers as oppose to bad hangovers anyways its still kind of an eerie judgmental vibe that started to come back. Just the tryptamine headspace and looking down a deserty California cliff was enough to trigger me and my memories of that fateful night. I went on explaining to my friend about that night and how it was so fucked and dangerous and tried comparing it to this and he was tripping so I think he could see and finally understand maybe a little better how much I was fucked that night. Still though..hell really never know.
