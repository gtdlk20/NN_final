I awoke around 3pm with a start after a 4 hour nap.  The visuals were still very noticeable although nowhere near as intense as the peak hours of madness.  I had an overwhelming feeling of calm and purity to the point where I cried lightly a few times.  We just kicked it inside my lovely little apartment smoking high-grade herb and snacking on real foods to replenish ourselves.  E and B later came over to revel in the afterglory.  It taught all of us alot about ourselves and brought us even closer together as friends.  Throughout the previous night and forever afterward, we would ask E how many hits he actually put on our space treats.  With his mischievous smile he would reply 'just 2'.  Later he would ask us, 'just 2?', and then laugh his ass off.
