We went to my room to sit and enjoy the ride.  H dissolved into the bed and didn't move for the longest time.  E and I just looked around the room and felt.  My room, lights on, was transformed into a 4 walled patio with a perfectly clear and starry night sky overhead.  Don't ask how, it just was.  B called my house and said that he had calmed down and wanted some company again.  We told him to ride on over if he felt comfortable driving.  He was down and 20 minutes later was at the door.  Upstairs we all synthesized some incredible energy flow and transfer.  H finally snapped back into our consciousness with a big smile on her face.  She said she had gotten lost in the bed, but was glad to be back.  The positivity we felt after getting through the first few hours was incredible.  For an hour in that room, we just sat in silence and looked around.  It was the surface of an alien planet in a time when none of us existed.  The speed and variation of the visuals was sooooo intense.  One thing I remarked about using lsd of this concentration is that the crystalline structure of my visual field was composed mostly of large pieces.  This is one reason why it made it so difficult to discern what the physical world was.  LSD of a lesser concentration seems to appear as smaller particles which allow one to see what objects are versus space.
