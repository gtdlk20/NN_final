It was starting to get light out by now. Ole then assured me that if it rains I will get wet. I am sure it was true and that was something that made me a little uneasy but at this time I was laying down in the tent staring at this red line through on the tent roof noticing that it was getting light out. I knew that this would bring on new hallucinations so I popped my head out and enjoyed looking at the branches while admiring the colors of green in contrast with the whitish gray milky color of the sky. The time then was probably around 4:30-5:00 am.
