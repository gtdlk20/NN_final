LSD had always fascinated me since I had first read about it in Ram Dass's book Be Here Now.  I never seemed to be able to find it in my area, and prior to this first experience, I had only tried marijuana and mushrooms.  When the chance came to purchase two hits of liquid LSD on altoids, I immediately took the offer.  I was uncertain of the strength of each hit, so I decided that I would take one, wait for the effects, than either take the second or give it to my friend B depending on the quality.
