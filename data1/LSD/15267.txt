5-7am: My body and mind have returned. The sense of time and awareness of where I am has also returned. I know where I am, who I am, and I can finally realize that I'm just in my dark room, inside of my house. This trip was the most intense I have ever experienced, even more so than my previous trip on half a strip of acid in the past. Patterns are still shifting, but its not intense enough to not realize that this is just a chemical shifting my vision. Lights are still quite watery, and I can still hear lights and see sounds. Yes, hear lights and see sounds. I'm okay at this point, I've fully accepted my trip and I'm no longer scared of what is present. Patterns are crazy and I'm playing some new funk/electronic music that is very pleasing. I've never heard music in such a vivid form as this. I'm relaxed and laying in my bed enjoying the comfort and security of my covers.
