It was getting cold, and I needed to get the blanket out from under the machines. I couldnt summon up the strength to take even one of them out, so I tugged on the blanket, ripping it in a few places, but finally got it out. I put it over my shoulders like a shamans shawl, grabbed the light, and started to walk in search of some real acid. All of a sudden I get a rush..totally electricand it stops. A few seconds later, another rushand it stops. I walk past a couple coming the opposite away and they comment on someone they see Wow, he is f**kd up. Another rushand it stops. I finally realized that 1) they were talking about me and 2) the rushes were coming and stopping whenever the red light on the back of the lantern flashed on and off. Without knowing it I had gotten deep into a trip.
