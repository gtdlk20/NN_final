I made it through my first semester at college.  (Champagne!) In typical college fashion of an early flight the next day, I stayed up all night so I could pass out on the plane. (Which I did.)  I got home later that night and I went out to see all my friends, and I was asked if I wanted some acid.  I'd always wanted to, so I jumped at the chance.  	Me and three friends did it the next day at about noon.  About one hour after putting two little squares of paper in my mouth I felt the something-not-quite-right feeling.  About half an hour later we were tripping balls.  That day included a journey to a chicken wing place, our favorite headshop, and then another friend's house where I drew some songs on her bedroom wall. (She let me.) Followed by a return to my house where we partied in my room, still tripping.  I smoked some weed and drank some grain alcohol that night, but there was no drunk or stoned, just acid trip.  Much later that night I went to my friends house, still tripping, to smoke his hookah.  I think I got to sleep at about seven or eight in the morning.
