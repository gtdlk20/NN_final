It was then that we learned from Kim that Victor had taken a fifth sugarcube (remember that extra one?)while we were outside smoking. Its amazing how little impact that had on us. we figured that he was having as good a time as us. Benny went into Victor's room with Kim while i squeezed myself behind a chair and began to fantasize as 'some things come from nothing' began to play. The music that entire night became a perfect soundtrack, following our moods to the letter. It is a beautiful song and i saw tiny people on the tops of the chair throwing things down to me on the floor. Benny came out and laughed, then changed the cd to medeski martin and wood (combustication).
