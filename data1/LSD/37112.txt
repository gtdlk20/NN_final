There was a moment where randy sat next to me and tried to talk to me but I didnt notice he was in distress and now I feel bad about it because he has a negative outlook on us all. Me and jesse decided to go outside for a little bit to see what everything looked like and it was still so visually intense that it was hard to handle so we went back inside and got some drinks and chilled for a little bit. Something to know about landon is that he always just kind of has this edge to him, like hes hiding something or he has something balled up inside so I tried to talk to him about it, just to strike some good conversation and explain to him that nobody here hates him and the anxiety was just caused by him being in the middle of it. But he just wasn't having it and he thought we all hated him. He instantly showered me with hostility and the whole vibe got anxious again and it became really shitty. So me jesse and dean decided to go outside once again and just sit and chill. Dean is usually anxious in his day to day life, he expressed this to me a while back but I figured if he really wanted to trip I'd involve him in it too, but this wasnt a good plan. While we were sitting outside dean just kept being super anxious and it rubbed off on jesse pretty bad and at that point he got really scared and confused. I went back in the house and laid on the couch and watched futurama but jesse just kept going in and out of the house looking really worried about something.
