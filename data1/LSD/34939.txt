A lot happened, so I will just give you the most interesting details in no particular order. I very interesting experience was star gazing. Lines formed between the stars forming constellations. But the were not any constellations. They were 3-D. To add even more complexity, they were not actually 3-D, but were made of 2-D lines that gave a sense of depth, like when you draw a cube. To extenuate this perspective effect, the stars were different sizes, so that the bigger ones would be were they would be closer tho the viewer if the shape was 3-D. Another interesting effect was an invisible buffolo on a monocolor TV screen. If you think about it, an infinite variety of shapes make up any shape, because any shape can be cut out of any shape. Well I saw the silhouette of an invisible buffolo on this surface. It was not a different color than the rest of the surface or separated with a line. The screen was still monocolor, but I just saw where the buffolo would be.
