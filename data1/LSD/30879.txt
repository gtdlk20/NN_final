At that point, an RA knocked on our door. It was Sunday night, and starting 11 PM, all halls of our university force us to turn music and voices down for quiet hours. I hadnt factored time in, so I immediately jumped to the conclusion that this person clearly knew we were on LSD, so I ran to Diannas room. She saw me and smiled anxiously, Len, you cant hide! This doesnt even look suspicious... they cant know! What would they write us up for? Being fucking weirdos covered in paint? Isnt that what college is all about?. For someone on acid, that was series of very logical arguments.
