I have done a bit of searching and cannot find any explanation behind a tolerance to lsd besides dormant or active pschotic disorders.  I am pretty sure I have no psychotic disorder but I have been told I need to be checked for ADD.  I would like to find out any correlations between tolerance and biological/psychological make up.  I smoke pot every day and meditate occasionally.  If any of you guys has any info on this subject I would be happy to hear it.
