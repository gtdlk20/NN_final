Now, George had warned me previously about some type of Ether that companies were putting into their smoke machine during these times.  He'd said it was like Amyl Nitrite in that it brought everyone up in seconds without them knowing and then they'd have a really ace time and tell all their friends about the gig - thus more gigs.  He also said that it had a habit of multiplying the effects of any substances that you were on by about four times.  Looking back I think it was some urban rumours that were going around - but I still think about it.  Anyway, I remember at one point (when Eat Static were playing) at a crux of a tune the smoke machine let out loads and ingulfed everyone.  In the next few seconds I watched as if not part of my body, as EVERYONE became one moving body.  Their eyes all widened and searching forwards.  it was like a huge wave of bodies all under one control.  Then, all of a sudden I felt my left upper leg lock in intense cramp.  I dropped like a sack of spuds and then really panicked.  No-one had even noticed I was writhing in agony!  If anything, they all seemed to just dance on me.  I picked a direction and crawled through the feet of the possessed crowd until I came to a door.  Stumbling through I was in a corridor and managed to slump myself down on a chair.
