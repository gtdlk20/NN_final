T=6:30: I reflected a bit on the experience.  The visual trails were very weak now.  I felt clean and cold but rather unkempt, the way I feel when I am getting over being sick with a high fever or after throwing up repeatedly from a stomach virus.  Like I was about to be healthy again.  I reflected on the historical connection between LSD and ergot poisoning, on my own speculations about the relationship between past experiences of feverish delirium and this experience with LSD.  I was tired but I felt peaceful and satisfied.  I went to sleep for about 12 hours.  I had been up all night tripping, though I was on a late schedule anyway.
