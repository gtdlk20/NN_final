It was a relatively typical condo.  After walking in the front door, immediately in front was a kitchen, to the side, a living room.  There was a spiral staircase between the kitchen and living room that led up to the computer 'room'.  The staircase was wrought iron with grating for stairs and there was a light set below it.  It was more or less a balcony on top that overhung the den.  The bedrooms were set in the very front of the place and I was to sleep in his roommates sister's room.  I set my stuff in there, peed and came back out.
