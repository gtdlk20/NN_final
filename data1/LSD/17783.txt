The whole place was vibrating and throbbing, and howls went up from around the camp.  I howled back, eliciting more howls in return.  This went on for a long time, throughout the night.  Chair and I went into the tent and laid together.  When I touched his hair, my fingers came away dripping with the rich darkness.  I could dip my finger into the puddle of his hair and pull it away, stretching long pieces of it out like taffy, even though I wasn't actually holding his hair.  I got an image of hundreds of eyes, and purple shafts of light shot out of the pupils of each in unison, shortly before a charcoal bullet was released from the same place.  Chair was lying right next to me, and one of his eyes kept disappearing.  His face was melting into the pillow, so I tried to keep his head up, but every time he put it back down, it would start melding with the pillow.
