And then it hit me, like a bomb, like a surprising explosion of truth That if all life were to be made one, it must continuously feed upon itself to sustain its existence. Figuratively speaking, one must chew ones own arm to give ones leg the possibility of growth. I cannot blame mosquitoes for thirsting for my blood, no matter what conditions life gives us, its only natural that life wants to live, and itll move out of its way to do so, no matter the costs.
