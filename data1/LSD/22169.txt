Once we reached the top of dam I turned round and leaned back as far as I could without falling over. My vision at that point was vast I could see everything all around my, the wind stretched the tips of the trees off into the distance, everything swirly and moving, alive! At this point I felt no longer human but a part of everything around me, as green and alive as what I was seeing. Then my friend pointed to the sky a humongous cloud was above us, lit red on the edges by the rising sun, suddenly the whole cloud and many of the surrounding clouds became brightly red, shiny, smooth, then soft and organic (we all saw this so Im quite certain this beautiful sight would have been just as amazing if we werent on acid) I concentrated on the cloud as it moved slowly, with grace and purpose. Then to my astonishment a lion cub appeared atop it, proud and facing the wind, he took a giant leap and fell plunging into the green paddock before me; this is a memory that will stick with me forever, a building block of my life I am sure.
