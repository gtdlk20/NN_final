The cabin possessed a styrofoam sailboard about 10 feet long. The rudder attachment was broken, and on the day before I had crudely repaired it and taken it out in a mild breeze. Now, the Wind blew, and I took the boat out again. Not a sailor, I did not know to tie a loop in the rope which held the sail (1/4 nylon twine). I held the rudder with right hand and wrapped the rope around my left hand. The Wind took me rapidly out into the lake, sailing against the wind. The rope cut into my hand. It became very difficult to hold on, and so, I quit. I had the thought, I should go practice music some more! I turned the boat around. At this moment, embarrassing to recount, I had a sexual release and wet my pants. I could no longer control the boat, and was blown about for the entire rest of the day by the Wind. At the end of the day, at sunset, the wind died when I was 50 yards from shore near the cabin, and I paddled in.
