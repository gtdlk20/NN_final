Summer Thoughts: "The thing I always notice during the come-up is some stomach discomfort. It feels kinda like negative G forces like when youÂ’re falling on a roller coaster or suddenly cresting a hill while driving. There is also a decent amount of jaw pressure like someone is grabbing the sides of your mouth and squeezing. These feelings slowly fade as you approach the peak, and completely disappear once you hit it."
