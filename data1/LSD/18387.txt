I was born a Muslim but I am not practicing Islam. The mythologies/folklore surrounding Islam talk about entities called jinns (genies) and angels and how they can appear to someone in altered states of consciousness which is what I saw. After the trip I came to understand that there is magic, there is evil, there is a God and yes there is an entire reality with other beings different from ours hidden in plain sight.
