When we managed to arrive back at the house, which Austin was taking care of for a friend of his cousins, it was about 8:30 Â– 8:50 in the nighttime. Upon or arrival I ended up standing in the entryway, soaking wet yet not displeased with the situation, for about 20 minutes. The reason I could not remove myself from the doorway was because I literally could not think of the first step necessary to get out.
