We come to the toll road and the woman asks for $4.75.  I check to make sure she meant four dollars, then continue on towards cedar point, pissed off that I had to pay to drive.  Why do I have to pay money to pay attention, keep my car from going off the road, and not hit anything?  I think that I should be getting paid for doing it successfully.  The world doesn't make sense I decide.
