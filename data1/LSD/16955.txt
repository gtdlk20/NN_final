I closed my eyes and I was seeing some very fucking cool but scary shit. Things that looked like ancient egyption pyramids and peoples of that time along with skeletal figures and demonic looking faces. All incredible and I'd do it over any day of the week but at that point where I was at right then it was a little too much for me. I needed somebody to be there with me and help me understand and comfort me. I attempted to call my daughters mother again with no luck and became upset and realized that it had only hit 7:40a.m. and that my little brothers and sisters were gone at school. At this point I totally lost track of time up until the end.
