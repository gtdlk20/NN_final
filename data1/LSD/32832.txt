We left before the show ended and we both felt like wandering around and just watching all the people around. It felt amazing to walk and my legs felt a little rubbery. I noticed I was sweating and the water felt very strange on my skin, and I loved how slippery it felt on my forehead and between my fingers. I couldnÂ’t hold back a huge smile from my face! We started talking to some drunk girls at one point and we were both laughing because they had no idea what we were experiencing. Conversation was difficult and required a lot of thought, but I felt I could still get a point across normally with some added effort. I felt like I could walk forever. We ended up going all the way to the main stage and caught a couple songs from the band there.
