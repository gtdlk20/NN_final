Its maybe 10:00pm. Its very dark in the tent, but the visuals from the acid are making everything rainbow. I dont know what triggers it, but I leave my body and enter some kind of void. I feel like Im in the space between light and dark. I can finally breathe, and I understand that Im not Emily anymore, Ive become something else. This void feels like space because everything is so dark, but Im surrounded by twinkling lights. It all makes sense, and its very familiar.
