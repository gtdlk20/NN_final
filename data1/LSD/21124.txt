We finally left and proceeded to the river and I felt great just this body high that felt like energy we crossed the bridge over the river and stopped half way on the bridge to look at the water below us and this water looked honestly crazy it looked like the water was morphing into itself I was excited to walk down below into the trees where there are trails you can walk into. We walked down into the trees and now my visuals are at an all time high everything was moving. I could see the trail of my cigarette when I flicked it. I tried to look at my phone screen and it was all over the place the numbers of the time on my home screen were bending so crazy. Being surrounded by trees and nature was beautiful. The trees and plants were bending. The floor was moving. The still water in this puddle were moving. I sat down under a tree and just enjoyed the moment with my eyes closed and my closed eyed visuals were very strong. I had tunnel vision with my eyes closed. I felt like my head was a dark arena with this show of unexplainable designs. I can't explainâ€‹ it very well.
