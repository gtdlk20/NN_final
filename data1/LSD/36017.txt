The night I did two cubes was a crazy night, the experience was absolutely amazing. I had only done one hit befor I did these two, so it was quite a leap in dosage. In the beginning of the night I was having an amazing amount of fun, riding a bmx around, jumping off stuff, times where good. After maybe 2 hours my peak began, and it was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. The hallucinations where absolutely insane, stuff like trees swaying in the non-existent wind, and clouds forming really beautiful shapes. The most odd thing that I had experienced was what I call 'cone vision' where the middle of my sight seemed closer to me than it really was, while the outer sides of my sight was farther away than it really was.
