Eventually we all three were sitting by the water's edge, I was obsessed with the stars, rosy was looking across the lake (which is fucking huge) at a mountain-side covered with trees and deuce was looking at the surface of the water. I was breifly captivated by the water because it looked like it was moving with massive amounts of speed, yet it was realitively still. At this point I leaned back in my chair,looked up at the night sky and let out a gutteral yawp that could be heard for great distances. I just had the urge to do it, and when I did I could feel all the vibrations of my vocal chords and the air rushing out of my lungs out into the sky that I was so captivated by.
