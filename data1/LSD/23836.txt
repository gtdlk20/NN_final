We froze dead in our tracks. Had someone somehow found us out??? We awaited our fate breathlessly. Then the voice spoke again. 'Everybody Limbo!!!' Suddenly we realized it was the public address announcer and limbo music began playing throughout the arena. Here we were, doing the limbo on acid while carrying 2 feet tall ice cream cones. Once again we broke into hysterical laughter. We decided to saunter upstairs and see what the world was like up there.
