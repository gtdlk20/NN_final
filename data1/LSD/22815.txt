(T+01:30) (Note, after this, complete loss of time co-ordination) I was feeling the trip, and very intensely. I had never had acid like this, I felt very good though, and was laughing at everything. One of my friends and I had ventured to the 'Chill-out Tent' and sat in there for a while, laughing our ass off at the funny patterns on the floor, the people around us talking about what seemed completely stupid, yet they were probably in the same state of mind as us. When they dimmed the light in this tent, we proceeded to leave as quickly as possible. We greeted our other friend who was still in the car. He was querying over the fact that a parked car with it's hazard lights on near us was not in fact a car, it was a spaceship. All three of us came to the general conclusion it was a spaceship, as near it we saw several people walk past with glow-sticks covering their body. This was a very laughing matter to us, as it concluded how fucked up we really were. We decided to venture to the other musical zones at the rave, as the drum and bass stage was only playing shitty breaks music, which none of us enjoyed.
