When I went to Diannas room to change, I realized I didnt even care about being nude with the door open. I have always been very confident and at ease with being naked, but it was always with people I knew. In this case, in order to put Diannas clothes on, I needed to go full topless for some seconds, and Frey was right there in the living room, which was directly adjacent. I found myself so contented in my own skin that I wouldnt have minded being full-on naked and dancing. Still, I did realize that it wasnt an option, because of our hosts.
