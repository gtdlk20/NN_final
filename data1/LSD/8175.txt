We left the residence hall in a laughing fit, meeting two other friends on the bench in the Quad who had no idea what we were up to. My friend and I kept to ourselves, commenting on the floating skateboarders and hockey players and otherwise common pedestrians that made up campus life. We called our friends and desperately wanted to meet them but couldn't because they were tripping so hard that they couldn't tell us where they were. Eventually they appeared behind us with a group of people and we all mingled in different circles. The muddy ground in front of the bench had a lot of faces in it now, as did the pavement leading back into the residence hall, the clouds in the sky, and the bark on the great tree in the quad.
