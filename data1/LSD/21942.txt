It was around this time that everyone began to feel the beginning of what would be an insane acid trip...except me. Everyone was saying how colors were becoming more vibrant and everyone started to giggle. Fuck. A was talking about all the fractals he was seeing and thought that he might want to take another hit. I obliged because it gave me a reason to go back and take another one too. I didn't want to be the only one not having an LSD trip. So I run back to my dorm which took about 5 minutes or so and eat another tab and pocket the other. I give it to A and he began telling me he started tripping super hard and was not sure if he should take the second tab. I reassured him that it wouldn't be bad as we had both tripped multiple times in the past. After he eats his tab we rejoin the others in the woods.
