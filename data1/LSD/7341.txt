That state could better be described by moving and dancing than words. That state could better be described by moving and dancing than words. So through dance we expressed our blissfulness. We danced to psytrance beats, which felt almost ancient and eternal. We were shuffling, I was doing what I could best describe as happy-walking, while playing with my arms and hands making symbols with my fingers. We were screaming and chanting, hugging, our bodies intertwined. Until we had finally reached a point when we wanted to move/dance but were physically exhausted. I remember feeling that at that moment, the wanting to express more, the will to experience more, more and more! The way our bodies smelled, the heat, the sweat, how we were gasping for air. All of that was the psychedelic experience, that couldn't possibly be reduced to simple wording. It was at that moment were I experienced such heavy visuals that I was 'blinded' of my vision of my surroundings for some seconds, I think my eyes went a little to the back of my head. It was blissful, almost mystical. I sat right across to my boyfriend, this time I chose to close my eyes and let the visions wash over me, for a short time. Sometime we lied across the floor, music still playing, looked at the ceiling and felt as if we were in a festival, but really our house was all we needed. Ohm symbols were reportedly witnessed by the both of us.
