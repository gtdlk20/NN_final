I checked my phone again. AJ replayed your snap 26m ago. So time was really passing, apparently. I tapped his name and nothing happened. I tapped another name and a chat window opened. I dont want to talk to T, I thought, I dont want to bother him. Returning to the home screen I tapped AJs name, and still nothing happened. His name swelled to a much larger size on the screen. I was frustrated. I knew I wasnt going to send him anything, I just wanted my phone to work. My phone working means things are real, this was not real, and I became extremely afraid.
