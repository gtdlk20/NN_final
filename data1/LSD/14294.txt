I started to feel uncomfortable and attributed it to my unclean house.. Dust on the window sill, possible mold and mildew, un-fresh air.. and a tripping partner with whom I wasn't all that familiar with.. Sweet Susie, what had I got myself into?  I recall standing and looking at Sunny for what seemed like quite a long time and thinking about how to go about getting rid of him should his presence become undesirable.  Little did I know my thoughts were becoming a threat to him, and before I knew it I was pondering the best place to go to dispose of his body (just in case), and was getting a look from Sunny like, 'OK man I can read your mind and you're really scaring me silly right now...'  He had an extremely uncomfortable/nervous grin on his face.  This was unacceptable, and I realized there would be no need to resort to violence.  We were in this together and would finish this together one way or another..  What to do in the meantime was now the issue at hand.  We sat on the couch and pondered the possibilities for 'my first time on acid'.
