At the time, I did not know or did not choose to think about what had just happened. I felt only relief. I knew I was coming down, that I would be ok. I spent the rest of the walk thinking as little as possible. All this happened on my way to the freeway, I did not know if I was north or south of where I was trying to get and went the wrong way up the freeway for a good long time. I stopped at a populated exit and asked directions. I hitched a ride from a trucker just before daylight. I appreciate that immensely, the warmth of that cab was extacy after my walk in the cold. To this day I pick up hitchhikers, just to give back a little.
