My friend has recently moved to a new house. Its bigger and better than his previous apartment, so we both figured it would be a great place to come down from a trip. I spent a long time trying to make up my mind about whether or not to go to a show at 7:30 that my girlfriend and I had tickets to. At around 6:30, I called her and on the phone I decided I shouldnt go. It would be too overwhelming. I was still tripping harder than Ive been in a long time. She didnt sound too disappointed. It was unfortunate that I wouldnt end up seeing her for the rest of the day, but within half an hour I realized that was definitely the right decision.
