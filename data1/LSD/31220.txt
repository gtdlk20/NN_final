Then, it all got really dark again. The roller coaster took me to a lot of spooky sights. I saw multiple devils, and interpretations of what the word demonic meant. I saw pure evil, and all that it embodied, but I wasnt affected. All of the skulls and skeletons (which, let me tell you, Ive been terrified of in the past), and smiling crows, and dolls turning their heads... they just didnt affect or scare me, at all. They were just inevitable. It was like, oh yeah, theres bad stuff in life, but it is part of life itself, so I couldnt avoid it. Nor did I want to. I wanted to face my evils, like I knew I was supposed to everyday, in reality.
