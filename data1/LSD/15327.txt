I did call the guys who originally sold it to methey were from Chicago as I recall, and had thousands of tabs. There was no way I was going to drive from NJ to Chicago unless I could  score enough to resell, and I just didnt have the cash for that. A great disappointment, because I never found any as pure or strong after that.
