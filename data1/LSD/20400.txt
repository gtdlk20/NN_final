Literally everything around me and ideas about where I was were no longer being perceived and I wasn't aware of my surroundings only my consciousness and I entered this dreamlike state (literally) where I began to very very vividly remember a dream I kept having at that period of time in my life and it involves me in that canyon coincidentally enough and I began to really explicitly feel like I was in that dream again and not just in that dream but in the whole dream world. The whole dream mindset and the whole abstract strange unexplainable feeling of dreams I slowly started to remember. I didn't even fucking know I had this dream let alone multiple times but the LSD somehow made me remember.
