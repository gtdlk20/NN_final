The next few hours were filled with laughter and joy while watching tourists make ridiculous poses in amongst the trees. I pondered whether the tourists were also on Lucy, or if they were behaving so ridiculously on purpose as to entertain me or if perhaps this was simply their normal behaviour. I then was asked to take a photo for a couple of tourists. The fact that I spoke English and the tourists spoke Chinese make the interaction difficult enough, but the added dimension that I was tripping balls and struggling to hold my shit together made the interaction all the more outrageous. I put a lot of energy into photographing the couple and felt tremendous joy being able to provide this service. Meanwhile J had gone on a walk and had also taken photos of some tourists including a selfie with an old nanny.
