I went to the kitchen and became fascinated by Portuguese tiles on the wall! Oh my, were they beautiful! Patterns of interlocking rings of the most vivid blue, each one slowly turning, clockwise and counter-clockwise. My resting right hand melted against my forehead, and the Pink Floyd album playing on the background was my only reality. What are these weird and exquisitely beautiful noises?! I didn't even remember who they were, or that there was any way out of that sound. And that was just the first wave.
