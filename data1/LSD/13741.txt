Time was warped in a big way at this point (+6:00).  I decided I needed to go to the bathroom, so I got up and drifted across the room (am I invisible?) without disrupting anybody.  As usual (for me anyway) the routine of evacuation of bodily fluids is always interesting.  I make my way back to my seat, Sophia comes over and asks me what took me so long.  I had no clue what she was talking about, I thought I was in and out of the bathroom in about 3 minutes.  She proceeded to tell me I was in there for 50 minutes!!  I couldn't even tell her what I was doing, I had no clue.  She took my hand, led me up to the kitchen and gave me another beer.  We spoke about what I was experiencing, the intensity, the visuals, the 'out-of bodiness' feeling.  I tried as best as I could to bring her there since she was experienced, but I was having difficulty communicating.  She led me to the couch to sit for a while, she was always so good to trip with or have around when tripping, and she just started touching me, not in a sexual way but in a gentle way.  The way it felt made my head swim in acceptance.  It was such a positive, friendly, thoughtful experience to sit with her at that moment in time.
