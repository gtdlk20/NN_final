The problems seemed to arise when I let myself zone out: my intellect drifting in and out of reality, and its metaphysical formations. Whenever I retreated into my own little world, I saw what was around me as a fraud - as a metaphysical landscape which, despite striving fearlessly, was definitely not the actual truth that I was exposed to on a daily basis. I was stuck in this dream-like haze, absorbing everything else around me, and soaking it in my melted brains acid- juice. Still, Id like to stress how much mentally hampered I wasnt. I was on drugs, sure, but when drunk, or stoned, Im usually less likely to be at a complete cognitive loss. I mean, nothing goes on, as far as brain functions go, when Im on those substances. Acid was much more like there was too much going on.
