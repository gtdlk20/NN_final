Before this incident I had never done LSD before but was by no means unexperienced with hallucinogens or just about everything short of highly addictive drugs(heroin, meth, crack).  I spent my last two years in highschool stoned and taking anything I could get my hands on (now a sophomore in college).  Near the end of senior year I quit drugs all together for a while.  Even stopped drinking coffee.  I would do this on and off for a couple months going back and forth from sober and being high on something from when I woke up until bed.  Each time going back to drugs I would just get worse and worse, (most regular substances- always had marijuana, addicted to diphenhydramine and would take pseudoephedrine and drink coffee to stay awake, and drank 5 days a week or so, smoked salvia almost daily for a while) just destroying my brain (my vision had been screwed up for a while now (hppd) and whatever other damage was done).  I must mention I suffered from severe depression for many years and drugs were my escape.  I knew I had a bad problem and kept trying to stop but Â… well, you know how it works.
