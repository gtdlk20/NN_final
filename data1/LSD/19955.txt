By this time I stand up to leave the room, as I advance towards the door ivy grew into my way reaching out with leaves unfolding.  Knowing they were no arms of ivy growing at unheard of rates in my room I press on and walk right through the things.  I reach my red door which had a white cross on it with a mirror and the word 'lazy' written in small font underneath.  Below the large cross is written 'life ends sometime' also in white.  I stumble through the ivy and reach the door where I stop dead in my tracks and look on in absolute...shock.  I say 'hell with it I gotta get outa here.' And open the door.
