Once I got out of the class I felt like I was free... At times I was sitting in the same spot for so long, I would begin to wonder when the last time I had moved my body was... There were many bricks that had intense designs and patterns I really wanted to look at... But iddn't have much time to. The bike ride home was awesome, I felt like I was floating..and could bike VERY fast without it feeling like I was pedaling at all.
