My first reaction was a sense of horror -- because I had forgotten the hellish feeling of Metaphysical Emptiness I had associated with this before.. the feeling (which I tried to describe in another report) that All is an empty illusion, and the only truly existing thing was just a brain/thought process that happened to be in a particular configuration in the pre-determined cycle. Instead of seeing the world, I saw the underlying reality behind the world, namely, the amorphous tissue behind the retina -- a total deconstruction of reality into the ugly, raw input. I was a mere detail, a mere surface expression of this inevitable program. But this time it made some sense that it hadn't really made before-- I knew I didn't have to get locked into a one-dimensional thought process (in which you can only do two things... go toward the light or away from it).
