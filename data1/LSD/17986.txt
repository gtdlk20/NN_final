B took mine and Es experience to be rather funny. He approached the situation calmly, even making the observation that we had made the entire downstairs a mess. Bs presence put me at ease very quickly, and eventually the acid winded slowly down to just a good fuzzy feeling at around 11:00 pm. The three of us wrapped up the night with a fat blunt and some good music. However, this would only be the beginning of the comedown that would last until late in the afternoon the next day. I got zero sleep that night. Theres something about acid that keeps my mind racing at a hundred miles per hour. I felt deathly exhausted, like my entire body and consciousness was hurled through a jet engine, but I didnt once doze off. My legs felt stiff and sore, as did my jaw and neck, like they had been clenched for a really long time. The next morning, B had come over again. He was selling wax, and E and I bought a few grams. So a little later at around 10:00 am, I took a healthy-sized dab to see if I could remedy some of the effects from the night before. Interestingly enough, the dab triggered some of the memories I had the dab triggered some of the memories I had, and since I was occupying the same trip-space, I ended up living through flashbacks of the whole night.
