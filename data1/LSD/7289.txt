Although my trip started out frightening, I felt overall it was a rather enlightening experience.  I had many new and exciting ideas, and realizations about human perception.  In hindsight, I realized that time seemed so slow because of the sheer amount of information I had to process while on LSD.  In normal day to day life, my mind was on autopilot for the most part.  I generally do not think about each bite of food, each single sound, each step, each breath or heart beat.  But on LSD, I was aware of everything, all at once, and my analysis of each sense made me take life second by second, compared to the autopilot I usually am driven by.
