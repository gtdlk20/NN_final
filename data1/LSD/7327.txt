In fact, most of my other trips have had a tendency to 'go bad' one way or another, but not inexplicably. It's very apparent to me that all of my bad trips were mostly due to having mixed different substances together, I was in a place I didn't feel safe, I was afraid people would judge me or I would be in an already negative mindset before experiencing the drug(s). Those times really made me figure out things about my psyche and personality that until then were dark, so I really cherish them as a lesson.
