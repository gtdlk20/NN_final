Before long I desire some distance from the sweaty energy of the alcohol saturated crowd, and I also want to actually SEE the show, enjoy the colors and appreciate the artistry of the band, which my mere 51 stature wont allow.  So we zig and zag through a maze from the floor to the side balcony and find a secret vantage point where we can watch the mass below without being consumed by it.  As I allow the band to transfix me with music and lights, I surrender to the retreat into my own mind.  Sensorily, Im here, watching and hearing and feeling a Wolfmother concert at the T Theater.  But psychologically Im in my own reality  and it occurs to me that we all are, from the girl who must be crushing her poor boyfriend by perching atop his shoulders, to the crowd surfer pumping her fists as hand after hand grazes her body, to the middle-aged woman bopping cheerfully in the aisle beside me, to my dreadlocked tripper buddies nodding their appreciation of the entire spectacle.  I flow with it.
