I was curious about what that ship was, and asked about it later when I was tripping.  I saw a man wearing one of those caps that veterans wear, it was blue and it said 'USS ----------'.  I looked it up and sure enough, the USS ---------- was a ship in the Pacific Theater in WWII.  In the early 1940s there was an explosion in which men were killed.  Strangely enough, it happened on my birthday...
