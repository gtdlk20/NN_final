My hair was still in that top knot Louise had solidly pinned up in place an hour before, (I actually have no idea how much time had passed. Dianna had devised a system where she would give Mark a call every hour, in order to keep track of time, but had given it up after the first two calls, as we had decided to succumb to acid and lose ourselves in its timeless dimension), but it wasnt going to save much from the furious dorm-room nozzle sprinkling Diannas bathtub was equipped with. In the real world we could have found a way for me not to get my hair wet, but thinking systematically about real-life practical solutions seemed like a removed concept. No, I knew that if I stepped in that tub, my glorious straightened locks would have turned into the unruly lions mane I was born with.
