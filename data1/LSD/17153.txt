Sometime around daybreak, I began to come down.  I could still, however, hear the music of the melody I had been hearing all night.  Upon my arrival home, I drank roughly half a gallon of orange juice, sat down, took off my boots, and began to write down the notes to the melody.  By the time I was done, I was no longer tripping at all- just very, very tired.  My legs felt as if I had been walking all night. (I have since ascertained that this was exactly the case- I walked for about 10 hours, through back roads, main streets, around the empty parking lot of a mall, etc.)
