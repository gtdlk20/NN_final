A bit later I see this geography earth science book and on the cover is that classic picture of those sand dunes that you see geologists and geology books reference so much. I noticed how the swirly patterns on the dunes almost matched the swirls in the wood pattern of the table we were sitting at and kept looking at them and comparing the two in awe and both of them saw this and my friend was just like ya I should be feeling it anytime now.
