There are creatures here.  There are no other human beings, as far as I can tell.  The creatures are enormous, the size of a two-storey house.  It's hard to tell what they look like, because their flesh is like looking at the sun.  They best I can describe is that it was like an enormous lion with wings, but that's not really what it is.  It had eyes.  I saw its eyes.  There was more than one of the creatures. They were very benevolent.  They said something to me, to the effect of, 'You can stay here with us forever, if you like.  But we want you to go back.  We want you to reincarnate.  But you don't have to.'
