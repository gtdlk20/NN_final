When we got back to the apartment, I was still peaking. I sat around and watched K play Prince of Persia, which was amazingly interesting. This is one of the rare video games that's actually interesting to watch when you're not playing even when you are NOT on a hallucinogenic drug. Being on a hallucinogenic drug, I happily watched K play for several hours. The screen grew and shrank, got more and less purple, and I had difficulty seeing that the colored shapes moving about were anything but colored shapes.
