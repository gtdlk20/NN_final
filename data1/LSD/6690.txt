I was still afraid to look.  Finally my man says 'It's ok, it was only somebody's motion sensor light in their yard.'  Holy smokes.  My pupils were so huge, that a mere porch ligh from 200 feet away seemed like a cop spotlight.    At this time I convinced everyone to go home.  I wanted a comfortable place that I was farmiliar with.  We ventured on down the hill throught these massive sticks sticking out of the ground as tall as we were all around us.  We obviously lost track of the trail, and could not find it.  I was practically running down the hill, frightened almost like someone was chasing me.  My boyfriend kept trying to hold me back and slow me down.  This only made me feel worse.  I was still peaking really good.  I could see the end of the trail that meets the main road.  It would look like it was 10 feet in front of my face.  I would take 30 more steps, and look up, and I was still as far away from the end as I was the last time I looked.  This went on for another 10 - 15 minutes, or so I thought before we were level.
