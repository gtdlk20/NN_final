T+3.00- My friend T is tripping pretty damn hard and says he wants to get out of my friends hotboxed basement flat and get some fresh air and go buy a can of coke at around midnight. So, being on acid, Im extremely suggestible, and I agree to go with him. Of course, no shops are open, but we go for a walk around the block anyway. Back on my friends road, theres some drunk guy getting beaten up by these two guys looks like theyre robbing him. I make T aware of whats happening, and, for a second theres a look of panic on his face. That look of panic triggers something in me and I sprint to my friends door, and ring his bell over and over again. He lets me and T back in. But the buzzer disturbed his parents. They see us. They know were on acid. I go back into my friends room and am blithering and panicking away, shouting at him No-one can understand me except for T, and I cant understand anyone except for T, and I genuinely couldnt understand a word anyone said. I just heard their voices So I decided to sit down and smoke some more weed for about half an hour
