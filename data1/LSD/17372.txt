I don't know if anyone else experiences this, but when I get tickled, I laugh and squeal, but underneath there is a real feeling of fear, like someone is coming too close to a sacred or private place, physically as well as mentally. M began to tickle me on my stomach, and I got that feeling, and I used the LSD to push past that feeling of fear (or let him into it).  What I felt then made me cry, and then I would laugh again, and then push him away when I needed to rest (pushing past fear takes a lot of energy).  After a minute or so I would let him back in, and this cycle of crying and laughing and gasping continued for about half an hour, and it began to bring up all this cruddy, phlegmy stuff that had been in my lungs for weeks (I can't cough like I used to), and I could breathe much better. Then we proceeded to take the energy we had built up into our hands, and our hands danced together, pushing waves of energy back and forth between us. Then we talked about some issues in our sex life that had been festering since we got into the car accident. And after all this, I felt so completely husked clean and light.  M setteled down to go to sleep, but I was not so lucky.
