	For a very brief moment, I got the strangest, scariest feeling that I was trapped inside life, inside my body, inside this universe, and that there was nothing I could do to escape from it. It was the same feeling that people often get when they think too much about death and become afraid of the fact that death is inevitable, and that theres nothing they can do about it (except to accept it). Fortunately, this feeling lasted only for a second or two, and didnt ruin my trip.
