This may serve either as an enticement or caveat for psychedelic trippers. I've gone into an egoless oblivion twice on tryptamine psychedelics, once on mushrooms, and once again on lsd about 7 years later.  This is a report on the latter lsd experience, in which I was out of my life/body/identity for around four hours.  That's a long time when you don't know your ass from a hole in the ground and are bent over in time warped tryptamine space!
