My junior prom was located at the Disneyland Hotel Ballroom in Anaheim, California.  A large group of us got together to take photographs of our formalwear.   My date, E.T. and I, matched well, and were excited for the dance.  I was very excited to go to the prom; having taken LSD on multiple occasions prior to prom, I decided that ingesting some LSD at the prom would be a good idea.  It sounded very fun.
