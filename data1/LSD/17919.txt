I was spending my birthday alone. I recall it was going to be the world premier of Madonna's 'Erotica' video on MTV. I was at a place in my life where I very much wanted to be successful at something, but I didn't think I was accomplishing much. I can see now that I was pulled in too many directions by my naive ideas of 'success' or 'doing right.' I was in graduate school, nearing completion of a PhD in a subject I wasn't much interested in, and I was feeling very sorry for myself. I was lost and trying to get found, either by finding my self or finding my non-self. I was a Buddhist and practicing meditation and had a pretty good vocabulary to describe my experience.
