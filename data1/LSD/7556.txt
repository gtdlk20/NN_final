I explained all this to my friends, our sober visitors.  They did not take me seriously and generally did not engage with my idea.  I remember in all of my interactions with them during the trip I always felt this awkward sense of separation from them.  They didn't get the things I was trying to talk about and they didn't try to.  To them it was a joke.  It frustrated me until I let it go and focused myself internally.  We did not actually spend much time with them.  I remember Arthur specifically did not like having them around very much because they upset his mojo.  He is very zen and he likes his tranquility.
