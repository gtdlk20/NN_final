After a long period of the walking in this manner, I experienced a blip. My everything was ripped away for a split second. I recognized that reality was more my creation than I had ever realized before, I saw the death rebirth process. Everything was quiet, and I looked about the void. I saw nothing around me, and thought 'Well... What now?'. I saw a point of light in the unimaginable distance, it moved towards me with immeasurable speed. As it approached I recognized that it was immeasurably large. It approached till it engulfed me and I was slammed back to reality.
