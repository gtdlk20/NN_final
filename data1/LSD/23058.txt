I walked into the kitchen to make more tea. Im still locked into that place I realized, Im still tripping, perhaps, maybe, Im not sure. I cant help it if I am right? Its probably psychological, Im just keeping myself there because my head is still there remembering, pondering, studying. Its not intense, but just faint enough. I can slightly see the sick pale glow on certain people, but I feel like its more of my imagination. Am I pretending to be tripping? Perhaps, but lets just keep pretending until the end, just long enough to finish this, so much more to go.
