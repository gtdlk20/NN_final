After more time went by I realized it was around 2 in the morning.  I was still hallucinating too.  I decided to call my from R because I heard he had a bad acid experience the week before and I wanted someone to talk to about my experience and get some advice in case anything happened.  He calmed me down a lot by saying things like, Dont worry man, in the morning all the bad and strange thoughts in your head will be gone.  You wont be thinking the same anymore.  Just put on some good music and relax as best as you can.  I took his advice and went upstairs on my computer and started listening to some of my favorite artists.  It really did calm me down a lot.  But I soon got bored because all I was doing was just sitting and listening.  I decided to go into my room and just watch TV for a while.
