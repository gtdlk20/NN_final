At one point a felt such a profound emotional pain that I screamed at the top of my voice to try to purge the horror from me.  I was standing in front my cottage.  As I screamed I thrust my arms behind me and smashed a window out with my elbow.  the glass cut my arm open.  The pain felt magnificent.  Again I wonder how much further I could have gone hurting myself.
