When we refer to thoughts and feelings, we like to use physical terms for them... 'sinking feeling', 'really reaching', 'deep thoughts', 'preying on the mind', 'a flash of insight', 'feeling tense'... I know why now... the unconscious mind knows full well what muscular tensions and motions correspond to various kinds of thoughts and emotions, and so 'figurative' language developed in a way that represents an accurate portrayal of these muscle motions. One particularly funny moment was the occurrence of dawn. Not just any dawn (in fact it was 3 am), but the Archetypal Dawning Moment, the dawn of a new age, I had finally 'awakened', something had 'dawned' on me. I felt that each awakening was a reconstruction of self-aware consciousness, a miniature echo of creation.
