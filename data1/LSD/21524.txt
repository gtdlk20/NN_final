The idea intrigued me, and we all headed out onto a grassy lawn just outside the apartment. The sky, which should have been black from the night, was a blazing orange punctuated by small, black clouds rushing across its surface. We sat in the grass, captured by the brilliant display. Then, thinking we were coming down, we went back inside to the room, wisely flipping on the lights as we did. W somehow rolled a joint, and we smoked as we debated whether or not to take another tab. W and I were all for it, but C and J were against it, so we smoked the rest of the joint instead. Almost instantly, we peaked again. The next few hours or so are a hazy recollection of running around the apartment, laughing, staring wide-eyed at shapes that werent there, shapes that chased us, eluded us, played tag with us. W and I met up in the bathroom and stared into the mirror for a while, just to check our eyes. As we suspectedbig as dinner plates. I remember distinctly one of the funniest moments of the night. J, C, and W were in the kitchen, I was in the living room. Suddenly, the kitchen light began to strobe, and each time it did, J would cry out in momentary panic. I went in to see what was going on, and found C and W laughing their asses off as J laid on the floor, squealing every time the light flashed. Then, Js roommate, who was across the parking lot with some other friends, walked in the door.
