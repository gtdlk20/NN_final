If I hadn't had tried any tryptamines prior to this it probably would have scared the shit out of me and shocked/perplexed me too much to carry on a conversation with someone I had just met. It was very strange being around someone who doesn't know you're on acid either. Especially after lengthy first time encounters. She was smoking a cigarette and the smell was really clear and intense. Despite me tripping the hell out and the acid hitting me for the first time I still carried out a very long conversation with her. We talked for what seemed like hours about what seemed like everything. We talked about alcohol, whiskey, weed, college, music, concerts, the neighborhood, break ins and crime and a bunch of stuffit was one of the most interesting and wonderful conversations I have ever had with another human being despite the whole eerie, folkloric, Wiccan vibe I was feeling and seeing at first. This eventually changed as we changed positions and new archetypes in the trip started to show as well as the colors. At one point she walked towards the driveway so Im looking at her standing in the driveway where its considerably brighter and more lit up; no longer having delusional thoughts or fantasies still talking to her about crime in the neighborhood or whatever and I noticed that everything behind her, on the side of her and in my peripherals all the colors and everything started to look really melty and liquidy. Everything in my peripherals all the colors and objects started to just blend together and it looked like swirled melty colorful paint, it was what I would call psychedelic tunnel vision.
