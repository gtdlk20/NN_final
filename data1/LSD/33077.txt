I took my 175ug tab at 10:15 pm. I was sitting on a chair on the back porch surrounded by my old pals that I hadn't seen in months. I let the tab sit under my tongue and swallow it after about 15 minutes. I thought swallowing the tab could decrease the intensity if this were a dose I couldn't handle. (I was probably wrong but I felt safer this way).
