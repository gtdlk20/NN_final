Since we didnt bother looking at our phones much to check the time, these are estimates (2:00-3:00 since we took it). Towards the peak of our trip, we decided to lie down and relax. As soon as my back made contact with the ground, I felt a wave of relief. I had never felt so relaxed and in unison with S and everything around me. We wanted to listen to some music now so S took out her iPod Shuffle and began skipping through songs. Since she shares it with two of her sisters, nothing too appealing came on so I decided to plug in my music. After two minutes of indecisiveness, I chose Dyer Maker by Led Zeppelin. The music sounded amazing and I felt like I was transported back to the seventies. But once the song reached the point where Robert Plant starts screaming, S read my mind and asked me to change it. As we continued to listen to some tunes, we put our shades on and stared up at the clouds. The clouds moved slowly in every direction and the edges of the clouds swirled slightly, it was one of the coolest things I had ever seen. After what felt like an hour of just looking up at the sky, S needed to go to the bathroom. When I checked my phone, only twenty minutes had passed since we first lied down! We were both completely shocked by how altered our time perception was and agreed that this trip was going to feel like forever. I had no Idea where the bathrooms were but S said she saw them earlier before we went on the trail, so we made it our mission to find the bathroom. I hopped on my bike after having completely forgotten about the noise and as I took the first pedal, my bike screamed like a banshee. I felt everyones eyes on me but I laughed it out. I told S that my bike was pretty bipolar because every now and then it would be quiet for a while, but as soon as you got accustomed to the silence, it would start screeching again.
