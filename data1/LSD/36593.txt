Anyway, I popped the two hits in my mouth at around 7:30 and sucked on them for a good 5 minutes, making sure that they were soaked into my tongue, and then swallowed them. I jammed with Chris for a while, not really paying attention to anything. About an hour later, I realized that I was not experiencing any effects. Alex suggested that my onset was just slower than most people's. I didn't want to believe it, but I did and went outside to smoke a cigarette. At 9:45 I was beginning to think that Alex had fucked me over with fake acid, but I watched him cut my hits from the same blotter him and C had done the previous Friday. I kept waiting for any psychedelic effects, but they never came and I finally went to sleep around 4:30.
