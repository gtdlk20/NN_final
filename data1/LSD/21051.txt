I desperately needed to smoke some pot.  Everyone at the party was openly drinking bier despite the fact that the Mr. and Mrs. were home.  I figured it wouldnt be a problem if I smoked some grass.  You cant smoke that here, its illegal, and the smell is very obvious, I was told as I packed a bowl.  I couldnt understand why I couldnt smoke some weed.  People allow their children to drink beer and alcohol, but smoking marijuana is frowned upon, and its senseless.  I guess some things Ill never know.  My high was intensifying, engulfing me with positive energies.
