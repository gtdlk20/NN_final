I would like to preface this report with a note on the terminology of ingesting sub-perceptual doses of LSD. Technically speaking, a psychedelic microdose is a sub-threshold dose of the substance. This would lead one to believe that the effects of said amount would be unperceivable. There seems to be a contradiction here that I wish to resolve. Call me a drug nerd or a word nerd, but if a microdose is defined as sub-perceptual, then perceiving anything from a dose you took disqualifies it as a true microdose. Since my experiences with small amounts of LSD have somehow fallen between the sub-perceptual and threshold realms, I propose the term minidose. Its lower than a museum dose, (One where effects are apparent beyond threshold levels to the user, but still appropriate for a public experience) but higher than a true microdose. Heres a more appropriate word for those of us that felt something that wasnt nothing, but nothing about it was really something, ya dig? Okay, report time!
