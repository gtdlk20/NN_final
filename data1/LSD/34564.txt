Finally when I came home my dad went to bed but I was still wide awake.  The rest of the trip was in my room.  At first the ceiling fan made me trip for awhile.  Then colors in the ceiling started to appear.  But the thing that made me trip the most is when I passed in front of the mirror.  I stopped and looked at my face only to realize it wasn't my face!  And it was constantly changing. Faces of people I never seen before appeared in the mirror Faces of people I never seen before appeared in the mirror with a kaleidoscope effect.  Then my face morphed and melted.
