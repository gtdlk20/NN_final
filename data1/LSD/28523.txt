Good idea! People showed up for the party and we all ended up having a great time. But I still have goosebumps about the hour or so of hell. Because when the acid is in my head, I cannot escape it..Anywhere I go I'm still tripping, and despite my love for psychedlics I think I got my fix of the ultimate acid trip where I felt anymore would just kill me. Ive eaten 5 hits before and not tripped as hard as I did off these thick, tasteless, star branded blotters. I dont think I will trip again for at least a year, even though everything worked out ok. Setting is everything, I thought my trip was over then I switched locations and I got a mindfuck.
