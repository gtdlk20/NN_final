The few people who were sitting there as well turned out to have been in the same school I was in a few years earlier and two of them turned out to be members of a Dutch drug-related forum where I am the moderator. That led to good conversations and we smoked joint after joint there, finally having the time to do the relaxing we had been waiting for all night. Outside the sun had come up and it was quite a lovely morning. Not as cold anymore and somewhat sunny. One of the people we ran into had taken a lot of MDMA and his eyes kept rolling away but it didnt disturb me at all. The patterns by now were moving a bit less heavily but the trip hadnt come down that much yet. While talking there I could hear some good fast and psychedelic beats coming from the church so we decided it was time to dance psychedelic.
