Then I closed my eyes and the recording took me to a place where there were lots of people watching a show where some guy was breathing fire. It was fantastic since it happened because of the music which was so profoundly done and detailed that the songs completely came alive in a visual sense. As the cd evolved, my consciousness started to fall asleep further and further and the last time I looked the time it was about 09:30. I was still conscious when the cd ended but fell asleep very quickly after that. I slept about 4 hours and woke up feeling very fresh and both mentally & physically good, with a very positive attitude towards the day. All and all, this was my best psychedelic trip so far, besides LSD I have had a few with mushrooms but this was something completely different from them. But that's another story. :)
