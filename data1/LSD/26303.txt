We collected and ventured into the main processing building for rocks and stone.  As a massive building it stood 6 stories high with a solid wooden frame structure.  Walking inside I noticed dust and rocks swirling into the same fractal geometrics as the trees.  The grains on the lumber flowed like wet paint applied by an invisible brush or roller.  The lines inside of the wood shone in a brilliant iridescent green and blue.  I was continuing to get surges of psychedelic energy that told me I was still on the rise of my trip.  After walking around some more we went back to the vehicles.  My trip had only started and I knew that it was going to be a very long night.
