When we entered the dorms, I ate a second tab, and the guys who I rode with decided to go meet another guy and drive around. I later learned that they spent the night riding with someone around town, watching transformers explode with a weird green flash and seeing the wind blow away the world. I proceeded to my room to attempt injecting a hit intravenously. I entered, set up several beat-sensitive neon lights, a blacklight, the playlists for the night, and then started Winamp visualizers. I prepared the shot by folding a square and placing it in the barrel of the syringe. As, LSD is water-soluble, I drew up 60 units of sterile, isotonic water and shook the hell out of it. After letting it sit a minute, I saw the water glowing under my blacklight, and said to no one in particular, 'It's time.' I found a vein and began. I quickly learned that injecting it too quickly burns; it had to be done at a very slow pace. About halfway through the process I was in a full-blown trip - and everything went dark. Apparently a tree fell on a transformer and took out the power. With some difficulty I finished the injection and stretched out on my bed. The visions were incredible, as the IV hit brought on an immediate peak. Being a rather experienced psychonaut, I felt comfortable enough to get up and go out into the hallway. It was still lit, the backup generators just didn't power individual rooms.....cheap-ass universities. Everything around me glowed green, except certain people, who were pink. I wandered downstairs and outside to smoke a cigarette. In doing so, I ran into three other friends.
