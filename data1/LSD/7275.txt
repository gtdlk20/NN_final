During this time spent on the couch, I did experience interesting visual and auditory hallucinations.  My friends were playing the video game 'Rock Band', which can have four players playing instruments at once.  When I focused on the screen long enough, it seemed as if the virtual singer on the screen was standing next to me, and singing specifically to me.  Also, noises made by my friends eating or newly arriving friends entering the house, seemed to sync up with the songs played by the video game, creating new and wild beats.
