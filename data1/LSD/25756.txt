About 10 minutes later I found myself to be staring at a rug in the corner of the room, it seemed to be 'breathing' as if it had a life of its own, this facinated me and it took me a while to come to terms why I was looking at a rug, pete was looking at me smiling (they know all about acid) about 5.40pm we all decided to go down the chippy and get dinner, although I was in no mood for eating, we left the house and walked down the high street by this time I was for lack of a better word fucked, I felt as if I had dropped a couple of pills I had the energetic feel of beans and I noticed that my visuals were distorting, lampposts were swaying very gently as if hanging in the breeze and the pavement in front of me was a myriad of weaving lines that threatened to trip me up if I wasn't careful, goddamn! These dots are nothing like the shitty blotters I had before, this was madness and I had to take the drivers seat..by the time we got to the chippy me and dave we jabbering about getting some mdma, this was the best idea in the world and no one could tell us otherwise, 'snap out of it, you've taken microdots, you dont know whats gonna happen, give it time'.
