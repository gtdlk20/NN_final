I hadnt slept all night, the only person at the party to do so.  Around 5:15 am, rhe Mrs. peeked her head over the couch and looked into my eyes, both of which were wide open.  Youre sweating, she said.  As everyone else woke up, The Mrs. served us an amazing breakfast.  She arranged to have her housekeeper drive me home.  I returned home, and later that day, my mother and I flew to  to visit family.  I never got in trouble for it.  The Prom was on a Thursday evening.  That following Monday, I ran a 10 Kilometer race.  I had not been in peak shape, but managed to run it in one hour.  I felt tired for a few days following the Prom, but shortly thereafter, felt fine.  The aftereffects were minimal.  However, prolonged use of any drug will result in more negative after effects.
