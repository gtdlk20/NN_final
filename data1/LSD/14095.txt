T=4:44: For the briefest moment I saw something small and bright and shimmering, outside the network or between the layers or somehow transcending it.  I have no idea what it was or what it was supposed to represent.  Perhaps it was some abstraction of pure existence or a notion of divinity or the totality of the universe as perceived.  I am not sure.  There is no reason to believe that it had any particular bearing in existence or possible experiences, but I can't shake the thought of it even now.  I was reflecting on the walls of Plato's cave as my own incoming sensory stimuli in the abstract, and then there was this outside thing.  Perhaps it represented the fundamentally unknowable (per the 'cogito') nature of true reality unlimited by our perceptions.  But I am not sure.
