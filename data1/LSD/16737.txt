To set the scene, we were in a large 120 year old house, the kind with walls that are about 11Â’ft high. The walls were ordained with green wallpaper depicting flowers, and vines. The carpets are red and cream also with interesting visual patterns. We were located in one of the upstairs rooms and had moved beds and comfortable armchairs up there on a very drunken previous party. Suffice it to say there was more than enough room for the 3 of us. So there we were, the three of us, set up comfortable wise, beckoning the onset of the trip.
