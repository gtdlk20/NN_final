When we left, we walked by a small bank of sand left by a construction crew and pretended, for just a moment to be at the beach.  This is lighthearted play, and I point it out beacuse it must be said that it is not a typical activity that I engage in.  I have fun, but in my own weird ways.  But I was able to just play like a child.  It felt beautiful.  We were then headed back home.  We sat for a while on a sidealk, facing a dead end street.  A man far at the end was walking toward us.  I have never come to realize so strongly as I did in that moment, how much we disconect ourselves from other people.  I watched him walk all the way toward us and finally past us, and until he was close, he almost didn't seem real.  This made me mildly sad.  We drew a bit with chalk rocks on the concrete, and this made Entheogen want to get back and paint.  So we started back on the road.
