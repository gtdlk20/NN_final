Pot was a great way to relax or kill a lazy afternoon; alcohol was, on the whole, not worth the next day; e was loads of fun but not something I would want to do on anything approaching a regular basis; coke was one hell of a high--but something was missing. I had, in all honesty, expected more. Drugs, I had found, were mostly good fun but lacked the one quality that had sparked a ten-year-old's imagination. I didn't want a mood-enhancer or just a way to get really fucked up. I wanted the world around me to change for just a few hours. I had tried mushrooms, but they were weak and the trip was, well, barely a trip at all. Bright colors and soft, friendly towels and the feeling of being incredibly stoned were all well and good--but I wanted to SEE things.
