That's when the really bizarre thing happened.  My mind was having a hard time serializing everything into one constant flow.  Effects were sometimes happening before causes.  I soon found myself pretty much trapped in my own mind, and found that my analytical thoughts were being used to process the high levels of sensory input.  My body was running on a sort of natural autopilot (I later found out that nobody thought anything was wrong with me), but I was well lost in my own head, having conversations with archetypes of my friends and watching possible futures unfold before me...different thought patterns would naturally fizzle out and such...eventually, I'd have a window where I could act again.
