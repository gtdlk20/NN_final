Last weekend, a friend of mine calls me up and asks if anyone I know would like to test a hit of acid that night to test the potency of it. I immediately jumped on this opportunity and had him come pick me and a couple of friends up from our dorm. We're all pretty experienced in mind-altering substances. My three closest friends here had all tripped on DXM with me, we've all done shrooms, 3 of us tried LSA; in fact, between the 4 of us, there were few popular drugs out there that we hadn't tried. A week or two prior to this event I had gotten some 5meo-dipt from the same guy who was asking me to test the acid, so I trusted him and took the hit. He said his friend had just bought it off some hippie and warned that it might just be a piece of paper without any LSD on it. So I took the acid and waited.
