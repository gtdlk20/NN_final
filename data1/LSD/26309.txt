My tonal weakened and I walked back down to the house, grabbed a guitar and plucked my death song.  A patch in the grass looked comfortable to die in.  I played the slow three note song like it was my own funeral.  Another good friend of mine showed up and I embraced him with a hug.  He was shocked at such a move until he saw my eyes and facial expression.  I was mournful for myself.  I thought it would be the last time we would ever meet.
