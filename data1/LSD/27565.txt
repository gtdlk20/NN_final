Task done I headed back to the party. As I walked back my mind, which had been taken up completely by the logistics of the phone call, began to truly wander and I realised that I couldnt remember How old I was, what day it was, whether I was in school, sixth form or whatever. I couldnt recollect if it was the holidays or just a normal weekend. When I tried to think of my life up to this night it seemed like abstract templates and half notions that wouldnt stay still and definite. Through a Herculean effort I managed to sweep aside such concerns and returned to the party.
