Today has been a real eye-opener of a trip and very valuable. It shed a lot of light on some addictions and bad habits I have fallen into and the fallacy and ultimate worthless destructiveness of them. IÂ’m not saying this one trip has cured me of all my ills, but I do believe it has been a stepping stone onto a better path.
