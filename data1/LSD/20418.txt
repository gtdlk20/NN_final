 I did look in the mirror and I have done this on shrooms before so it wasnt too new, it was really only minimally different. I see myself and I have this vibrational higher dimensional alien/hybrid look to my face and my skin and I looked very detailed. I have had this alien/hybrid look to my face before on mushrooms but this felt a little less alien and more vibratory and yeajust like I popped in from some higher dimensional plane temporarily. The bathroom was very dirty but I was used to it and this feeling of looking in the mirror felt so legendary and personal that it made up for the bathroom being dirty. I felt that by looking in this mirror knee deep in my LSD trip it made me feel like I was a part of something that so many other people have been a part of as well. I felt like I was just another participant in this legendary trip or weird dimension.
