Being there for a while now and beginning to feel unwelcome it was time to go home.My brother had driven me home and the drive home was just as intense as anything.After saying good night to my mother,me and my brother decided to go in the hot tub and smoke a bowl(after smoking alot earlyer in the evening,which I had forgot to mention).When we got in the hot tub I noticed things where still tripping me out and I was still in fact tripping,because I had thought I came down before I got in the hot tub.We spent a while in the hot tub listening to music,and then I decided to go to bed.Of course before going to bed I had to listen to Tool,because,one I was one acid,Two Tool is good music,3 Tool is good music especially when you're high so why wouldnt it be great when you're on acid.After falling into tool for a while I finally made my way to bed.At first it was nice and peacfull,a nice vision of a well in the middle of forest blanketed by a purple haze with creatures strewn about.All of the sudden the vison became very bright and it was hard to sleep but I eventually fell asleep.
