I am an experienced lsd user. I don't have an exact count, but I have had many dozens of experiences, in as many different settings. I've had good, and bad trips, l; goofy and enlightening experiences. None however were as intense as my most recent, an unexpectedly high dose on an empty stomach. My usual source of the compound had dried up, and an acquaintance happened to have a different supply. I decided to give it a try. He didn't make mention of the dose, and I didn't ask. This was my mistake. I purchased two tabs, cynically expecting each tab to be dosed at 75-100 micrograms max. My usual dose is what I believe to be 200 micrograms, although one can never know for certain, and I expected this to be no different than usual course of actions.
