Jess and I both noticed light coming from behind us on occasion, but it never had a source.  There were more rainbows, in the form of strings, making up nets and grid patterns to the side.  Unseen branches hanging over the path and hitting us in the faces caused me to hallucinate fake ones in rainbow color.  It was at this point the I was the most in control of my visuals.  I got rid of the unseen crowd because it was freaking me out a little bit, and then created my own personal iridescent 3D spherical force field around myself.
