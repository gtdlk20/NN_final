From there we went to a supermarket and a diner. I have no idea, or no remembrance, of why we were at the supermarket. However, I do remember walking around feeling almost superior in a way than all the other shoppers. Not superior in a conceited way, but in that I felt I was on another level from them. A level of higher awareness, not concerned with trivial things like groceries and daily troubles. There was life to lived! We looked each person we walked past directly in the eyes with a huge smile on our faces. We were on acid and damn proud of it!
