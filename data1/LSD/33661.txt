We have boarded the ferris wheel and it is interesting gazing at the parking lot. It's crazy how this many people will all come to one place to wait in lines.  It feels like I've been at Cedar Point all my life and I'm ready to leave it behind forever.  I tell my friends my decision to never return to Cedar Point and C for the time being agrees.  I start explaining what my day has been like and C tells me we need to stop talking until the acid wears off.  We have been talking about everything for the entire day and it seems logical to take a break.  At the moment I can't even describe how my day went, and just accept the silence.
