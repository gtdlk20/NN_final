I opened my eyes to find that the walls of the room had completely disappeared into an inky black, endless darkness. The ceiling, now freed of the constraints of walls, stretched high above my head at odd angles where it typically lay flat. It looked and felt like I was in a completely new place. Left and right nauseatingly merged into a single, impossible direction, but I could still somewhat distinguish between up and down.
