We left to meet the other two just around the corner from the house. I new one of the guys and could tell by his expression that he wanted to go home, he seemed to have been dragged here by his companion who was looking for a good night spliff. Thankfully we had left almost the entire stash back at the house, this made it a lot easier to get rid of him as lying about how much we had wouldn't be a problem. I let the others take care of the situation, I couldn't handle all the noise. If I did speak to them I think I would have told the to 'fuck off', that would have led to a very painful conclusion to the evening.
