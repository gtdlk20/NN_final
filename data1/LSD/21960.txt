Headed back to my dorm we are walking up a hill and realize A doesn't have his car keys. We ask him where they are and he takes out his wallet and opens it and money starts falling out. S says dude how are you going to get home? to which A shrugs off as if unimportant. We finally get inside when A begins to come to and realizes that he left his keys in the woods. J joins us in my room because he is beginning to feel better too. They all go out to find A's keys and are trips are effectively over. However, A tells me what happened to him after S and I left the woods, and J tells me his trip after he went back to his dorm.
