I'm here to write about my third LSD experience, specifically, because it was by far the most intense trip I've had. The first time I tried it was spectacular, and three other friends were there experiencing it with me--I got some definite visuals, but that trip was still mostly mental, like the mushrooms to the tenth degree. My second trip was only on one hit, and was not very intense at all; mostly it kept me awake, and very aware of and interested in my surroudings.
