Indoors and with power on, we continued to experience massive amounts of spacetime distortion.  While talking to H in one room, I explained how strange it was upstairs and she told me I hadn't been up there yet.  I started to geek out at how confusing it was on this unprecedented level of tryptamine infusion.  We couldn't decide on what was really happening, so at some point we just chose to surrender to the hyperreal vortex of particles and energy.  My sober roommate awoke to have us turn down the music.  We just started laughing at how he floated in and out of the universe we created.  Until we saw him, no one had even considered the possibility that there were others in this place who weren't experiencing the same thing.  In my mind, there was absolutely no concept of sobriety left, and all sense of ego was dissolved.
