For example, Summer was experiencing a loop that she got stuck on for a bunch of our peak, whether she was really tripping or not, was this reality or not, was she real or not, and etc. Having to remind herself that shes just in our condo, in our office, doing acid with me and that it would eventually end. She would know this and understand it but would then have herself loop back to questioning what is happening, if she is real, if this is real, entirely forgetting again that she is just laying on the floor of our office on the carpet or sitting on the couch with me. An existential crisis. And looping like that again and again and again and again. And the thing is, and I can confirm this from my own experiences, she was at times aware she was in a loop but unable to escape. Its like being pulled along, almost as if something is forcing you to experience these thoughts over and over again. Your whole world is often time condensed down to this thought, you almost lose track of your surroundings and are consumed inside your head, even if you have your eyes open.
