What were these ideas? I couldn't be sure, but for a second I thought I had discovered some horrible truth about the situation I was in. A sleep-deprived coma became my state, but completely alert and aware, just lacking the ability to remember any of it in any real coherent sense. Two hours after the initial phone call my friend arrived. The moment I entered the car, he took one look at me and said What did you do last night? After I turned to make eye contact with him, he grinned and his question was answered. How did you know? I asked, but he merely waved his hand away and responded with Can you get more?!! Rodriguez apparently understood the desire to go sight seeing.
