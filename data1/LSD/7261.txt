I waited until the weekend, and met up with two friends, J and B, around 2 in the afternoon.  I took my first altoid hit around this time, letting it sit under my tongue and dissolve.  My friends and I sat in my room until I started to feel different, at which point I decided it would be best to distance myself from my unknowing family and go for a walk.
