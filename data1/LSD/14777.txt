While dancing I lost all track of time. Everything around me seemed faded and I kept thinking strange sentences while the music seemed to move me instead of me moving to the music. One of the sentences I thought was, I want to put the now into the everything. I had been thinking about the concept of time a lot I had been thinking about the concept of time a lot as it was slowed down and the present seemed to be a much wider concept then it usually is. After dancing for more then an hour we were finally hot instead of cold so we decided to go outside and cool down. Sitting down on the block near the gravel again I saw the same complicated colourful patterns as easily as in the night even though now the sun was shining. The visuals were only just starting to get a little less strong, this was one lengthy heavy trip. We decided, after we had cooled down, it was the perfect moment to dance so we went back into the church which was now even getting quite empty. This time dancing seemed even more amazing then the previous time we had done it. I decided for that moment LSD can be quite a party drug if you know how to party. I thought much and nothing at all in the same time. There werent many words but many visions in my mind, words didnt fit onto my thoughts at that point.
