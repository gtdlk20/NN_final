I had been daning for about 10 minutes or so, a song or 2 into the first set, when a hippie chick who had put a sticker on my face earlier walked up to me. I spent almost the entire first set making out with her, and didn't find out anything more about her than her name. I must say, that was probably the best way to come on to acid that I could ever imagine. It's difficult to say how much the LSD was really affecting me at this point, as I was rather busy, there was something odd happening. Things were starting to get WIERD.
