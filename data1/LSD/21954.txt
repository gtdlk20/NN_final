S and I decide that we should probably figure out how to get out the woods. We tell A to follow us because we need to figure out where we are. We take about 5 steps and then A forgets what we are doing and does the whole SHOUT and THANK YOU routine again and again. Eventually we get far enough that we reach a wall. Just a wall in the middle of the woods and for some reason S and I find this to be the funniest thing ever and we fall into a laughing fit. The top of the wall had a platform/ledge. A noticed this and grabs my arm and starts pulling it towards the direction of the ledge. I say to him, what are you doing? and he just points to the ledge and says up there.
