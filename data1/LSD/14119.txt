That said, I remain deeply humbled and grateful that no damage appears to have been done.  My actions were reckless; I took at least twice as much as I should have without realizing that it took so long to kick in for me, having assumed stupidly that it was just weaker or more dilute than advertised.  Reading further, this appears to be a common mistake, and apparently the time of onset simply varies widely between people.  I do not regret being solo, though -- some of the experiences that I had would have been weaker or less authentic or overpoweringly embarrassing and anxiety-provoking had someone else been there observing, and had I not had to make my own way through.  I cannot say this is right for most people; frankly it probably isn't.  But even in the depths of delirium and insanity I have always been safe with myself.
