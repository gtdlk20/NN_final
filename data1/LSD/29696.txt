It took quite a few years to 'recover' from the effects. For what seemed like a lifetime (6 years) I still saw spinning wheels in front of my eyes during my awake hours. The clouds would be full a faces at night. While affected by these persistent post trippen signs, I had to have faith and peace. I had to remember I was still in control of my life and mind. I could achieve whatever I determine to put my mind to. Since those younger years, I have married, had children, and acheived. I have still had an occasional momentary trip, but who cares.
