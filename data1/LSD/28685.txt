I suggested smoking the joint we brought and all agreed.  It was a rather large joint and I figured if nothing else I was going to get really stoned.  After the first couple rips I could really feel the effects of the LSD.  The lights started to swirl and grow very defined rays off of them.  The music kept me swaying just as everyone seemed to be.  The crowd seemed to be moving together.  I began having closed eye visuals that seemed to portray what I thought the music was trying to convey.  During what seemed to be the peak of my experience they were starting a song that I was unfamiliar with.  They got a little ways into it and a loud boom shook me.  I was very startled and the mood of the crowd seemed to go sour.  The music was off and the band didn't look very happy.  After a lot racket the band started up the same song from the beginning.  This settled me down along with the rest of the crowd.  They were getting to about the point where the catastrophie had happened before and another very similar noise shook my body once again.  I was now very confused and was wondering if I was reliving past experiences, visualizing things that had already happened.  The silence of the music lasted a lot longer this time but the crowd made up for the loss of noise.  The music finally started back up again and all was well.  They played for a really long time, I think to make up for the disturbance.
