I could see red and blue and green lines pulsating up and down my arm in rhythm with everything else.  Eventually I did get the computer on and managed to play a song.  I laid on the floor and listened to the music, which seemed to be coming from all directions at once.  As I closed my eyes, I felt my body rise off of the floor, and patterns and colors assaulted me.  I ended up listening to an Eels song over and over again.. one of the lyrics was 'my skin is melting off, i'm mopping up the sweaty drops..' This drove me nuts, it was fascinating and real.. I felt like I was connected to the earth in a way that I've never been before, as if I was not an individual anymore, but as big as the universe itself, engulfing the room with my mind and body at the same time.  For a while I got frightened, I felt like a deer with a rifle pointed at it; helpless and alone in a different dimension. Time didn't exist, and it is difficult to let go of yourself in that way.
