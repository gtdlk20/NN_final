Finish activity at 22:30. I was feeling energetic, so decided to head to a dancefloor. On the way there, had half a joint. This made me feel spaced out and relaxed. Got to the club and order 1 rum&coke; with a looooot of ice. That drink, plus one glass of water, got me dancing up until 1:30am. I was not feeling super excited but more like if IÂ’ve had a great nap and could just keep up for a long time. Decided to leave the club of a responsibility aspect of actually getting up the next day, but my energy could have kept me longer.
