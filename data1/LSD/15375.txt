I'm a 21 year old musician, chess player, and psychonaut.  I'd say I have an intermediate experience with hallucinogens having done mushrooms more times than I can count and acid a dozen times.  I have no family or personal history of mental illness, I smoke marijuana daily, and I generally have my life together.
