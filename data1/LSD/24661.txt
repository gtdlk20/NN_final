After a few near-accidents, my friends decide to stop on the side of the road and let it die down a bit before continuing. After a few minutes of disc jockeying, they decide to get out and look at the stars (interstate, middle of nowhere, 5am, no cars). They let me out and we all walk around on the interstate looking at the stars and at strange patterns made by the tar stains on the road.
