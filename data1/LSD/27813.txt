I become strangely 'inverted'... outer and inner reality were somehow reversed. I could 'see' my brain 'out there' (even though it looks like ordinary reality for the most part, I 'knew better'), and it was kind of hard to make sense of ordinary tactal input. I think there was something weird about left/right being reversed that confused me. I was lost inside the brain and didn't know where the eyeholes were. I was locked into perceiving oneself as a brain and I couldn't figure out how to turn myself back 'outside-out'. I spent many minutes trying to figure out how my cat was able to exist inside my brain there with me. I thought it was because she was actually projecting herself into my thoughts. I also was a bit concerned that I would have cat hairs in my brain.
