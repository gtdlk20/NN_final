After talking with M I was feeling tons better, but J was still floundering with the drug so he and I decided to go on a walk around the campus.  Being outside felt much better and we found a good spot to sit on campus underneath a sort of bridge that connected two halves of a building. We probably sat for an hour or more, sometimes silently sometimes talking.  Outside I finally returned to some visual effects of the trip; the bricks in the wall across from me seemed to be moving, every other row seemed to be scrolling to the left or to the right.  I talked about how I underestimated the acid, how it was completely different than I had anticipated.  He said that he too wasn't having a normal trip but had been spending most of the time thinking about his life, school, and other concerns that he had been having.  We decided that while we weren't having a normal trip it was still positive in the end.  It had put things in a new perspective for both of us.  Sitting outside there calmed us both down and put us in a sort of self-cleansing state of mind.  The total experience had left me emotionally exhausted, the way I feel after a heavy cry and something I hadn't felt in a long time.
