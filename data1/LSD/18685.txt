We made our way over to the art museum (B attends a college in the city, so everything was within walking distance). We had a friend, K, meet up with us there just to keep an eye on us as we were going to be heading inside a museum, for obvious reasons. As we entered the lobby there were about 5 employees and no other people visiting the exhibit.  Surprisingly  I didnt feel the sense of anxious awkwardness I feel on mushrooms when in the presence of people who arent tripping (or people who probably arent cool with it), instead I felt extremely upbeat as we were about to view some of the most amazing pieces of art ON ACID!  We got inside the exhibit and everyone kinda began to do their own thing and head their own way. We were probably there for almost 2 hours. Let me just say that if you have the opportunity to view amazing art like I saw on acid, definitely do it.  The exhibit was filled with Picasso's, Monet's, Van Gogh, Dali, Renoir it was an amazing experience and I will never look at art in the same light again. After the museum (this is about 6-7 hours since dosing) we headed back over to the dorms where we lit up another J and began listening to some music just enjoying ourselves and having great conversation. We headed out to a nearby diner, we were all still noticeably tripping, so this was an experience in and of itself. I have never had such trouble ordering something off of a damn menu, Im sure the waitress thought we were crazy. There were a few other kids who came in after us and began being really loud and obnoxious so we decided it was time to take off. We ended up over at Ks place and watch the newest Futurama Movie. After the movie we went back to Bs dorm where we smoked a J and all got into some pajamas and turned on The Flaming Lips:Live in Kansas City Zoo dvd, which is where I fell asleep (about 12-15 hours after dosing).
