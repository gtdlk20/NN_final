Classifications of this transcendant reality can only vaguely be compared to those of mundane life.  Good and evil were irrelevant, there was only a greater good.  Color, sound, etc. were irrelevant as well, just raw perception without limits.  The words 'purpose', 'significance', and 'will' hint at what pervaded everything.  Everything was as it should be.
