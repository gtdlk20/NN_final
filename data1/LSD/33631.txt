Waiting in line for the 3d dissapator or something, suddenly I'm given new hope for Cedar Point.  I realize that we have already rode a few rides and done a lot of drugs.  I would rather have ridden more rides but maybe people will go home and we will have the park to ourselves I think.  Once we get inside the building waiting in line isn't such a chore anymore.  Before now, me and C were completely silent in the lines and just stared at each other to make sure if anyone was staring at us, at least we wouldn't be staring back because that's how I got myself into trouble on the ferris wheel.  The acid had me very paranoid and I had to gather myself each time before getting very close to people (like waiting in line).
