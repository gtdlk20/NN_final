I left the mall in a great hurry and walked to the nearest bus stop to catch a bus home.  Had I known the story of Albert Hofmann's second (and intentional) trip, I might've described my feelings at this point as he did at the onset of his trip: 'extreme personal crisis'.  Though I waited about 5 minutes, it seemed like an eternity.  There were hundreds of people out on the streets, and every one of them seemed to be mutated or twisted in a unclear sort of way.  The bricks that made up the sidewalk sent up half-visible smokily twisting versions of themselves, and stretched and bent about people's feet as they walked by.
