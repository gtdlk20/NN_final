We are on our way again when we come across a sign. A is still forgetting where we are going every couple steps so we didn't make much progress. While A is off in his own fantasy land S and I try to decipher the map which was way more difficult than we had originally thought. We walk around a bend and sit down to smoke more weed. A is still on the other side of the bend but we can hear him talking to himself, he is no more than 40 feet away. We take a couple hits then we hear A sound super serious and explaining what he is doing. S and I look at each other realizing A has encountered other people and start walking away briskly to avoid being heard. A comes around the bend and we realize that he was still just talking to himself. We are both relieved and find it kinda hilarious.
