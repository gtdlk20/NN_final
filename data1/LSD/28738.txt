I sat down between two tree trunk roots and proceeded to sit in the same spot for the next 2-3 hours. Upon sitting down, I still had 2 more tabs in my pocket, and decided to take 1 more and split the other one with my friend. This was not a good idea, since I was already tripping I should have waited a bit longer but I didnÂ’t think I would have an opportunity like this again, so I took 1 more and split another half with my friend.
