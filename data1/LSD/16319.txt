This was not a planned trip, but it couldn't have worked out better if it had been. I'd had two hits of LSD bumming around in my freezer for 'whenever' for a while, and it was only at about 12:15 on the night in question that it even occurred to me to do them. I had some friends over, and we were sitting around, doing nothing, smoking some pot, when it occurred to me that I didn't have to work the next day--so hey, why not? At 12:30 I took my two remaining hits, quit smoking pot for the night because I figured anything I smoked would be good pot wasted on someone who wouldn't notice it, and sat back. No one else was tripping with me.
