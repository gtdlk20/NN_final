Around 2:00am, me, Jack, and Mark decided to go to our friend 'Mary's' house. We drove up the road as it swerved left and right. It was coming at me in all different directions. We got on the highway and all the lights were neon streaks. A Maryland State Trooper drove by us so we decided to go left into a parking lot to get away, even though he already drove by. It seemed like a good idea at the time. So for about 20 minutes Jack and Mark are trying to direct me out of the parking lot as were just going in circles. Eventually we exited after nearly going into oncoming traffic.
