Summer placed four different pieces of blotter paper on the table. One of them was a small 100 microgram square, which was for me, and two were tinier half pieces. There was also a little extra bit that Dianna and Summer also split. All in all, Id say they had about 50 micrograms each as their ultimate dose. (One of the reasons I was initially opposed to them splitting the other blotter was because their doses would have been significantly lower than mine, which I thought would have put me on a whole different level of experience, and I didnt want to be alone. Luckily, this didnt turn out to be an issue for any factor, besides duration of our trips, but Ill get to that later.)
