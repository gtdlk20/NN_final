For the final night of the party I had decided to eat a ten strip of Albert Hofmann blotter that I had been saving. I remember dancing. I remember the lights. The sound of fire spinning around. The smell of the earth itself as thousands stomped the ground, raising a cloud of dust. At some point (I think it was around midnight) I asked a guy on the dance floor next to me if I could have a drink out of his water bottle. He told me to help myself, that it was in his bag that was sitting under the speaker next to us. I found it and took a very long hard swig, planning on refilling it for him at one of the water spigots that were set up. Just as I was about to finish chugging his water, he ran up and grabbed my arm, asking me 'does that water bottle have a black line drawn on it'? I looked at it and told him it did. This is when he began a low maniacal laugh that I will remember for the rest of my life. I asked with some trepidation what was in the bottle. His answer: 'Man, I hope you like LSD and speed!'
