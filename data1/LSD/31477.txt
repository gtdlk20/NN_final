All in all every trip I've had has been wonderful I dont think theres a better drug out there, LSD is magical and purely spiritual...I feel so at home and at place in the world and pretty much all knowing (or at least I do)... LSD is beautiful and should be treated with respect...theres nothing better or a more incredible feeling than being on it... Me and my friends have never had any bad trips by keeping open minds and stay happy, no worries, and wel have the most beautiful, amazing, enlightening experience ever!!!
