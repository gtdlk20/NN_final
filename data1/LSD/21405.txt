I started doing serious research on psychedelics a few months before the start of 2018, eventually narrowing down on LSD, and eventually spent a week planning out the circumstances and the objectives of my first trip. Knowing the importance of set and setting; the plan was to trip alone at my house, during the day, starting at about six o'clock in the morning.
