Somehow, of course, there is a part of the mind in all this that is still just observing. Even as the panic was intensifying, there is something which is capable of noticing things, and which is capable of directing action. As I noticed this, I somehow formed the thought that, 'Yes, you might do something to hurt yourself or others. But if you notice something that doesn't seem right, just slow down a little and consider changing course.' This was not a complete relief from the looping thoughts or fantasies, but it did provide a little fresh air. Even if I had no confidence or was lost in confusion, I could just notice things as best as I could, and just try to do the reasonable thing.
