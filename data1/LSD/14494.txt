I finally finished the dishes and realized I still hadnt gotten a drink. I got all of my laughs out before going out in the dining room this time, and seriously prepared to witness the mayhem of Chuck E. Cheeses on LSD. Grabbing my cup, I stumbled out in the madness. The atmosphere was more painful than I remembered. About five times as many screaming kids had arrived, each with two arguing parents. The music playing on the PA was loud and painful; I couldnt wait to get back into the kitchen. I walked to the soda fountain staring at my feet the entire way hoping no ex-acid head from the 60s would sense what sort of influence I was under. I quickly scurried back into the kitchen after saying hello to the girl who had been in my head all morning.
