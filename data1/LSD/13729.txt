It was the end of winter, sometime in late February (not sure of actual day).  I had been on a fairly decent abstinence of psychedelics; almost 2 years, when I was invited to sample some 'green pyramids' to celebrate the birthday of someone near and dear.  I quickly accepted, looking for one last experience before jumping headlong into life (i.e. marriage, children, responsibility).
