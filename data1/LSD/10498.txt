I was frozen.  I was no longer a human being.  I was a cog in the 4th dimension.  I was the extradimensional being that existed only in the space of time.  A voice surrounded me.  It asked what my perception of time was.  I didn't know.  It explained to me the difficulty that people have with time.  He said that the reason so many people are late for so many things is that they believe in time, but are unsure if it exists.  I said that time didn't exist.  We invented it.  He said that an idea is stronger than a piece of stone.  An idea will live on forever and that stone will crumble.  Time is only as real as we make it.
