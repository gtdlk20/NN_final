After about 45 minutes I was thinking to myself, either one of my best friends ripped me off, or I must be immune to this compound.  Then, in that very second, fantasy merged with reality, as a cartoon train literally came out of one of the television sets which I was viewing.  It circled the room and returned back to the world it came from.  From that moment, everything around me was surreal.  Colors were so intense that I was in awe of how limiting visual perception is in our everyday lives.  Music acquired a life of its own, and it was a part of me.  People around me became fellow explorers in a quest to reach ultimate bliss and fulfillment.  Life was so full and wonderful at that moment, that my only wish was immortality in this beautiful state.
