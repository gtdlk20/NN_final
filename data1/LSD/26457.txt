So here I was in the center of this room staring at the wall with my favorite techno dj tape on (dan efex:protocols) and the moment it started I felt as though I was being pulled further and further away. When I finally looked at what I was seeing, I realized I was looking out of my face as if I was seeing through the holes of my eyes, nose and mouth. Eventually I was no longer there at all. The experience itself remains somewhat of a mystery, but  I do know that I attained knowledge, memories and life experiences of someone else which I knew of when it happened but the setting of this out of body experience was completely foreign to me, out of this world. I highly recommend to all those people out there who are into experience, find Hallucinogen:the lone deranger, or something known as GOA trance, and take a listen while in a good LSD/marijuana state and you will understand what I mean. Salvia is next on my list so expect to hear from me again.
