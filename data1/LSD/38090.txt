Time was also very distorted. Neither of us had a watch nor any way to keep track of what time it was. We had to go back to my house at some point to prepare ourselves to get on the train (we decided not to drive; multiple felons maybe, but responsible people). At what must have been 4:00, we had a huge discussion over what time it was. We were sure that it was nearly 7 and we had to go back soon to get ready for the show. We smoked a bowl and headed back to my house. Well, it turned out that it was 4:30 when we got back (meaning we smoked up at 4:20 - very cool, very cool; we can never make 4:20 unless it's accidental for some reason). After we realized it was early still, we headed back, but the entire rest of the day, time kept doing odd things to us.
