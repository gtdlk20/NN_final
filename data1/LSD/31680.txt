Now, this is about 11pm. This was when things took an unexpected turn. My mom had come from work. I came back from work and I was more talkative than usual. Finally while we were having dinner my mom knew something was not usual. I was also sweating. I revealed that I had taken LSD, and parents being parents, that too my mom being a doctor having an orthodox view about these substances and drugs, lost her cool. She became chaotic and we had our infamous 'fight'. I tried my level best to make her explain that I know what I am doing and I didn't take drugs without doing the prior research. But it was in vain. I also cried thinking about death and how it is approaching my grandparents. But finally I calmed her down and she went to sleep.
