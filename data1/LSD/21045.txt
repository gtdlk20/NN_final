The second thing that occurred subconsciously took place when we arrived to the after party.  I was sitting in the Limousine, and I looked to my right and realized that everyone in the Limo had exited except for three others and me.  Those who hadnt left the Limo were to my left, and were unable to get out of the Limo because I wouldnt move.  I suppose I was non-responsive because they seemed very irritated and confused as to why I wouldnt exit the Limo.  This was the second time that I had done something that I had no control over.  In both situations, it wasnt until after I did the subconscious action that I realized I even did it.
