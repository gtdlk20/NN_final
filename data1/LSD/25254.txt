Then, like a picture forming, my immediate view began to transmogrify into a thousand interlacing eyes peering intently with their piercing pupils upon my retarded, simplistic insignificant self. At this I stood and stared, with glazed eyes as my mate informed me later, trying to comprehend the meaning behind such a depiction, whilst I felt a flurry of emotion engulf my soul from interest to apathy, curiousity to fear as if each had no reasoning nor meaning behind, just a different aspect of constant motion. At fear, unfortunately, I lost myself to and all that it entails followed. As fear is one of the most integral, primal emotions or reaction that any intelligeable being posseses, its easy to lose ones self to such and when it is a result of some vision or something that is not an immediate threat to mortality, like the fear of death or whatever, flowing emotion is rendered perishable or susceptible to all things ill.
