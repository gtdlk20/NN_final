About 1 hour later the acid started to kick in. I felt a warm feeling rise through my body, it started from my feet and rose up very quickly and stopped right in the middle of my chest. I looked around myself and saw that everything was a little brighter than usual, like the colour contrast would be more intense. This was similar to the earlier trips, but in a different setting, which was my room. The only difference I noticed was that I felt the alcohol's effects covering my flow of thought which was the major difference when compared to the earlier trips.
