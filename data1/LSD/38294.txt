I sat on the couch and listened to my walkman. I felt like I was in the music. I couldn't see myself anymore, I could just hear the music all around me. Then I closed my eyes and opened them to what seemed to be a universe and all this time I could hear music playing in the backround. I lost track of time and it seemed like an eternity, but when I closed my eyes and opened them again, I was in my neighborhood walking and it was daytime. This all on the kraziest 14 hour acid trip of my life. I tell you, this really was something else. Almost like a dream in reality.
