When in my room, I loaded up a bowl of 20x salvia extract into a glass bubbler. With the assistance of my friend, I prepared to take my trip to yet another dimension. I took one massive hit, then another, and after one more the bowl was cashed out. BANG! I exploded. The sensations were indescribable. I saw bright blue laughing demons in the room, outside the window, in the walls. A few minutes later I came back to reality -- at least, the reality that was LSD. I put on headphones and lay down on my bed as my friend loaded a bong. He took the green hit, then passed it to me. I rolled over and took a hit. I was gone. I let him smoke the rest of the ganja and we chilled a while. Eventually he left and I was left on my bed, stuck, wandering through the world in my mind.
