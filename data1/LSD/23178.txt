The first 45 minutes went by and absolutely no effects were noticed. After about an hour and a half after taking the acid I began to intensely feel the effects. I began to question the nature of things for some odd reason. This led me to my 30 gallon fish tank, which I had recently purchased. I began rambling on about how these fish should be free, and what a shitty life they must be living now. This conversation brought my friend and girlfriend to the tank. They began gazing, and my girlfriend agreed with my comment. I began to hate the people that must have captured them and sent them to the pet store ultimately doomed to swim in my rectangular tank for the remainder of their lives.
