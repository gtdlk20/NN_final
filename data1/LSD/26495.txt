The hairs on the backs of my arms suddenly leapt into life, thrusting themselves upon my consciousness, growing, changing.... I felt strange as a result of this, because it was me that was changing also, not just the surroundings. I decided not to look at my arm anymore, and made a decision to save the spiritual experience until later on in the trip.
