As well as the visual hallucinations, I also had situational hallucinations. Keep in mind, that hallucinations are not dillusions. You can tell hallucination from reality. But I had a hallucination that X was my dad. I knew he wasn't, and he had no characteristics of my dad that could be detected by the five senses. It more just felt like this whole thing was a dad/son adventure. Music was also very odd. After every lick, it would end out of tune. But even though it was not in tune from a conventional standpoint, it sounded very good in its own unique way.
