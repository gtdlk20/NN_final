to begin, i am a very experienced user of acid. i recreationally use lsd to explore other dimensions and secluded mindsets which i believe the brain hides because mankind isn't civilized enough to comprehend these thoughts and feelings.  i dosed at approximately 11 am. at approximately 11:45 i began to feel the rising effects, slight disembodiment, confusion, trails, bright colors, etc.  i had a sitter, also a very experienced tripper, and he was only baked.  to make a very long and sensual trip into a beautiful universe short, the most vivid memory of the trip was the first valley after a frenzy.  i looked at my hand because i was instructed to do so by a very bright, ambient color changing figure i later found to be my lava lamp, but as i opened my hand i felt a rush of perfection and i still to this day believe that what i felt and saw in my hand, was the entire universe expanding and showing me its secrets.  each time i try to describe what i felt at that moment i almost cry.  it is to this day the most beautiful thing i have ever felt.
