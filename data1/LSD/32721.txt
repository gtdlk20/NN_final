T 0:30 - By the time I finished my test I was coming up strong.  I handed in my test, and scurried out of school.  It was strange leaving, the patterns on the floor began morphing.  I decided to walk into the bathroom to check myself and take a piss before hitting the road.  My pupils were very dilated and I had the appearance of someone high on drugs.  It was still snowing when I got out to my car, so I hopped in, popped some good tunes in my CD player, I think it was United States of America, good stuff, and proceeded to make the 30 minute drive home.
