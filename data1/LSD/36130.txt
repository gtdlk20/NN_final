Another room steel sounds rain down force from the ceiling big black bags around this guyÂ’s eyes like coal sacks all the way to the ears cap peak coming over straight darkening mechanic. Another room dusty, dark, empty time delaying. Another room he comes down on his victim heavy with a fist I see it all blood spurting out of his nose and mouth - sledgehammer - smash the huge lump of metal crashes up through the edge of his jaw shattering tooth and bone across the room man drops death gurgling head coming apart - Get out! Run! Leave the building blood from the victim splattered on my shirt mind spinning sickening turns - get away from there! Go! Darkness spinning in from all sides.
