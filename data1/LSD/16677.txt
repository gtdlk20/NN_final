By the time my friend arrived to pick us up we were tripping pretty hard.  We grabbed all our stuff and headed down to his car.  As we were packing the trunk I beat on my hand drum to listen to the echos coming of the building.  It took about 40 minutes to drive south from Flagstaff, AZ to Camp Verde, during which Jess and I sat in the back like little kids on a road trip, staring out the windows and asking non-sensical questions.  The 40 minutes felt much longer.  Just outside Camp Verde we got onto a bumpy dirt road winding around the contours of mountains through a river valley.
