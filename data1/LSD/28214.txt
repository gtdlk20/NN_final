We eventually also decided to take a trip to a dining area here. Everyone seemed to be looking at us, eating wasn't a high priority because LSD makes me lose my appetite. I had only french fries, none of which I remember eating. The others either had nothing but fruit. It was alright except we ran into an authority figure, not a cop but someone who could get us in trouble. For first time trippers, going out with lots of people is not recommended until you know how to handle it and how you will feel.
