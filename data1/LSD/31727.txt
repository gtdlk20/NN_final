The evening began with the intentions to do shrooms and go to an all night drive in with one of my best friends K. K had called her dealer and realized he could only get LSD, so I we decided to get it anyway and see where it took us. We bought 2 hits of Acid and went back to her house with some pot, the film Waking Life, and my paints and canvases. We couldn't make it to the movie so we were having a night in. I took half of my hit at 9:30 and listened to some music, waiting for our other friend to show up. He had a car and was not on anything and wanted to go in to the city to get fast food. We listened to music and waiting for our friend S to show up. It was 10:30 when I took the other hit, and just kind of forgot about it as we went for the drive in to BK.
