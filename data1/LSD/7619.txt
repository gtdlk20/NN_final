           Another interesting thing about the faces I see on acid is that a lot of the time they mimic the facial expressions  that I make at them. As I stared at the textured ceiling in my boyfriends dorm room, I made many different facial expressions  from happiness to pain to anger  and saw that the faces tended to copy these expressions by changing their mouths from open to closed or their eyes from small to large. The only expression they didnt mimic was happiness. The faces I see tend to only have an emotional range that goes from neutral to pain. However, when I looked over at my boyfriend, who has long curly hair, I saw that he had multiple faces clinging to his hair. When he smiled at me, it seemed as if all the faces did too, however the smiles werent really visible, and the faces seemed instead to be sending out a positive emotional wave, rather than giving visible smiles.
