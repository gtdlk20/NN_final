The experience opened my eyes amazingly to what the mind could do if provided with the right ingredients. I would definitely do LSD again and definitely in the company of others I trust. I think I will be waiting a while to do so though, I can tell that something like that is not good for my brain and it should be allowed a fair bit of time to recover.
