At around 5 o'clock, there was a marching band practice for the football game at 7:30 that evening. a friend of mine informed me that my pupils were still noticably dilated. This particular football game was band senior parent's night, and being that I was a senior, I got to walk down the fifty yard line escorted by my parents.  I informed them that i was feeling just fine. They never suspected a thing.
