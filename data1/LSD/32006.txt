I said 'Damn, Bruce. My life is all types of messed up. I have an alcoholic dad, we're losing our house soon and my friend just had to see all the shit that just happened.' Then Bruce looked at me in the eyes and then pointed at the river. He said, 'Your life is just like this river. There may be rocks and obstacles in the way, but it keeps on flowing just as you will. You are 17, you will be an adult soon and all will be well.' Immediately after he said that my eyes flew open and it was like a huge realization moment. It calmed me down so much and after that the rest of my trip went very well.
