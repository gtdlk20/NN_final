We have wondered around the park looking for rides with lines less than 2 hours long and have been completely unsuccessful.  Once we ended up going into a room filled with fog and no light.  There were strange people coming up to us and trying to scare us, and it was working.  After leaving that part of the park all I can do is complain that we had to walk through a ride.  Giving up we decide to leave the park.  Only problem is I'm still tripping and can't drive yet.  I know that I won't be sober in time for the park to close but I know that waiting an hour or two will help a lot.  Willing to do anything to kill time we wait in line for the ferris wheel.
