I was having kind of an emotionally difficult time (sober) at the regional burn in my area.  I was introduced to someone I sort of knew, but instinctively trusted, and they asked me if I wanted a microdose of LSD, explaining that it was 15 ug, or 1/12 strength of a regular dose diluted in some grain alcohol.   It was in a glass vial, and a small drop was placed on my hand and I licked it off.
