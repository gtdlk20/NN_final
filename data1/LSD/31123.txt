Oh wow, thank you! she said. I dont think Id make the same observation in a sober state - this girl had crooked teeth, unruly frizzy hair, and was slightly short and stubby. Yet she was perfect, naturally effortless in her harmonious self, and I couldnt hold it in from her. As she walked away, she recommended some website for...something? Like a natural-remedy doctor, I think. I didnt know, neither did I care too much. I kept watching her small feet stumble through in heavy, dark boots. How could I tell her how faultlessly she moved? Your color is green! I announced as she headed in the subway. She frowned, and was probably a little weirded out, Ah. I guess Ill keep that in mind!, she said skeptically. Maybe she thought I was stoned. Maybe she recognized my condition!
