J took us on a quick drive to a local park, where we got out and began to walk through the woods.  The first effects of the LSD manifested in how I perceived the clouds- they seemed  very flat, and I could see very defined rays of light shining down between them.  In the forest, the trees seemed to be convulsing in unison, bending in towards me against the wind.  I had experienced similar 'breathing' effects on mushrooms, and I decided that I wanted to surpass that previous experience, so I took the second hit.  At this point it was about 3:00, an hour after my first hit.
