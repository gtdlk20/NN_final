We finished off our night by listening to Pink Floyds The Dark Side of the Moon (of course) and reattempting Revolution 9 while looking at computer screen savers of objects flying towards the screen. The shape and angle of the objects (stars, for instance) was always changing and jumping from the screen in some cases. Sometimes I was looking up at rainstorm, other times down a wormhole, zipping across light-years.
