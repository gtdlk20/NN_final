Close to the end of the movie I started to feel the body effects LSD usually gives me so at 6:30pm I decided to go take a bath and use my new bath bomb I got. It was probably the best bath I had ever taken, I lifted the bath bomb out the water and watched the bubbles for a long time. By this time I was seeing small visuals and got out the bath. At 7pm I ended up laying down and watching YouTube videos of soap cutting (yes soap cutting I know) after a while I decided to ask my mom to take me to the gas station for a drink. As I got into the car the visuals and body effects kicked in a lot harder. I've never been in a car on my come up so it was really different. We got what we needed and headed home, mind you my mom has no idea I am tripping at this point. In the car for some unknown reason I wanted to laugh but I knew my mom would ask what's funny so I tried to turn the other way and hold it in but tears came to my eyes and she ended up asking what's wrong. Now me and my mom don't have the best relationship and I have been trying to mend it so all of the sudden I start thinking about that and go into full blown crying and start talking to her about our relationship.
