11:13 AM (T 1:13) I notice the classic electricity feeling of the substance in the crown region of my skull. This is a familiar sensation I get from LSD that feels like a mildly metallic energy. Its not a shock per se, but similar to the sensation you get when a very weak 9-Volt battery touches your tongue. Its not distracting or intrusive; more like a tickle.
