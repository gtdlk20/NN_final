People went out on the back porch and played some hack. Normally I'm able to play well enough but didn't quite feel up to it. :) I followed because most of the people I knew went that way. A friend kept urging me to play but I didn't quite feel up to taking my feet off the ground. A few minutes later the people in the room stopped making sense. They would talk almost constantly but with disconnected words or short phrases, I must admit it was all fairly stupid and I can only assume reflects upon my thoughts on those people.
