What would it do to you? I have always had good plugs, good friends, and a stable environment to trip in, but all of my experiences with psychedelics paled in comparison to this and it was one of my less risky endeavors.

You could secretly slip someone a pot brownie for the first time and scare the hell out of them, but what happens when you give someone drugs like this when theyre not ready? Most of the people I know going around looking for acid are average partiers just looking for some cool colors, euphoria, and whatever else might be bundled in a lower intensity trip. These people (myself included) are usually looking for more of an MDMA / Molly high, but they dont know how to describe it effectively, especially if theyve never taken any kind of psych. It got me thinking about how my brothers and I typically make fun of the old homeless men that wander aimlessly around the city covered in dark and mysterious tattoos, but now the three of us had joined them on their endless march. The only difference was that when we finally couldnt drag our bodies any further, we had a place to rest until normal life resumed.
