We had left the house before 1am (any real concept of time was lost for the next few hours). The five of us decided to head for the nearest park to make full use of the children's playground. Thankfully it was only about two minutes walk from his front door. We were delayed by the sounds of cats fighting. The noise was incredibly loud and seem to come from all around us. I remember standing in the middle of the road spinning round in a circle trying to pinpoint the source of the sound. My hands began to wave around in front of my face even though I hadn't told them too. The combination of this noise and the silhouettes of my hands became too much. I stopped just in time to stop myself from going crazy.
