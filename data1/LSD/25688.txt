i stumbled back to the car and waited for the others. When everyone came out of the party i demanded that Victor's girlfriend (Donna) drive us back to Victor's place. I proceeded to crawl into the passengers seat and lock my seatbelt. That party had scared me, and i was very small and afraid. As everyone piled into the car it was so hot that i rolled down the window and leaned out babbling 'we have to go, we have to go'. So Donna puts the car in reverse, and instead of backing out, slams on the gas and plows into a huge bush, which smacks me in the face. I cannot describe the terror i felt. I began to cry. i was so lost and afraid. I balled while Benny and Victor laughed and Donna apologized. Later on, in the car, Victor was describing how as a child he couldn't pronounce the letter R. I immediately began to laugh hysterically, completely coming out of the hole i was in. We decided that the other girl, Kim, would stay with us for the duration of the trip. We had no idea what we were getting into.
