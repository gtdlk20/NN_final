We had also obtained several types of beautiful buds (Mango, Pez, G-13, Smiley, Purple Star, and some White Russian we'd brought along) and we decided to go back to our tent and take some icy bong hits out of our new bong. We had brought a cooler full of ice for just this purpose.  Our tent was set up on top of a hill, overlooking the entire barter faire in all its glory.  The place was full of people - it looked like a temporary city had been erected in the middle of a desert.  There was a constant stream of incoming cars.  There were drums beating in the distance, and the happy cries of the delighted participants of the faire.
