Our friends weren't there and we were confused but also cold so we went into one of the springs.  It was a small rectangular pool inside a stone room painted with many images from previous visitors.  We sat in its warmth and I found that by lifting my hands from the water I could manipulate the steam that came off of them.  I sold some more mushrooms to some cool people who were there when we got there.  I smoked some pot out of a pipe that was offered to me by a cool old kinda fat guy who later bought some mushrooms.  He sang songs and told us storys from his lifetime.  I later found out that the pipe and weed had belonged to a man that he knew who was murdered in an argument fueled by speed and alcohol.  That tripped us out.  We looked in wonder at the paintings on the walls.  After quite some time our friends arrived, late, and I was surrounded by familiar people.  They were all drinking wine so I got to have some good red wine in the comfort of the spring.  Jess and I were still both very happy and I felt positive vibes from her all night.
