So, Sunny and I were now alone.  I had mixed feelings about this.  Sunny had buttloads of experience with LSD which calmed me, but he was also known to be quite immature, and a wild party animal, and I really didn't know what acid would do to two dudes cooped up alone.  These sorts of thoughts started running through my mind.  Considering all the infinite possibilities led to uncertainty, but the further along we were, the more I put my trust in Sunny to know what was good for me 'My first time on acid' (in quotations because this phrase was a repeated theme for us).  This trust would be challenged and twisted, and thoughts of betrayal caused the most unsettling times of the night.  Sunny suggested that it might not be a bad idea to relax and watch a movie.  I agreed, and started going through my collection. Nothing too complicated, sinister, or disgusting.  I could imagine with each title what I figured it would be like to watch each one.  Wild Boyz was a particularly off-putting possibility.  I knew there were certain triggers that could potentially cause a horrible experience, and just seeing Steve-O's face was probably one of those triggers.  I finally landed on 'Back to the Future' which Sunny somehow knew I wouldn't be able to handle.  Poppycock!  I put it in, started her up, and didn't make it through the first 20 minutes.  Doc's face began to bubble and warp and I thought for sure I was going to throw up or void-bowel in my pants if I had to watch the whole movie.  With a sense of urgency I took it out, and told Sunny surely he could pick the perfect movie for 'My first time on acid'.
