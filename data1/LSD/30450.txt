Anyhow onto the good stuff. I had 2 good size triangular doses of Lucy wrapped in foil in my wallet. I decided to walk the backroads to a bicycle/walking trail near my house that runs along a river. I had with me; my doses, a pack of smokes, the Daodejing, a bottle of water and my cell phone. However I forgot something crucial to this trip which was my zune. This was not a completely fatal mistake but however.
