Time just kept repeating and we saw my Russian friend who only went out a few times go out over and over and over and over and over again..It was all so strange and confusing and my tripping friend said Im so confused or This is so confusing then he said This is a weird night and the colors were just so bright and everything seemed kind of cartoonish or vibrant but surreal and arabesque. All the patterns were popping out and everything was also extremely vivid and alive. He was right though my tripping friend. This wasnt what you would call a super happy trip/night but instead a powerful and profound trip and a 'strange night man'. Not too recreational honestly. But amazing and incredible and incredibly psychedelic.
