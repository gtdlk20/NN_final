I decided that I had decided what I was going to do, so I had better just stop worrying about it or I was going have bigger problems. I decided to count 1,2,3,4loop as a way of keeping my mind occupied. After a while I noticed that I had timed my counting to my breathing, a short while later I noticed that I had timed my steps to my breathing. After that it became much easier to walk. I later learned that this is a Buddhist practice: walking meditation. A good book on walking meditation is 'The Long Road Turns to Joy', written by Thich Nhat Hanh.
