I know people who have barely anything with crazy screwed up lives...no parents, no money, barely a roof over their head, but me? Well I had everything my parents were still together, I had money, I had a roof over my head, I was spoiled. All those thoughts just clicked in my head and I started bawling my eyes out harder than I ever had before because I treated my parents like sh*t even though they did everything for me and I realized how lucky I was.

This was the life changing part in my trip because after this, I treated my parents with so much more respect and rarely ever talked back to them...they had no idea that LSD was the change to that.
