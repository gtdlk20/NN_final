So feeling heavy and odd yet smiling I go to consume the hot wings.  They tasted like something Emerill would make.  We each sit down with our plate and turn on comedy central.  It was 7 o'clock because a new episode of South Park is on.  We finish our hot wings and wait a while longer.  The sun sinks into it's western horizon.  It was an omen, a forebearer of the night to come.  As it set, so the acid set in.  Sparking of South Park characters Kenny and Kartman was proficient in their eyes.  I looked outside and saw a pink sky that began to change color to orange then to red.  My arm itched, I looked down and my hair was growing, moving, shimmying around a fly that wasn't there.  I smiled and invited my friend to go outside and enjoy a cigarette with me.
