At the time none of us realized what had trancepired [sic] that night, I hope I conveyed it into words suitably.  It was the perfect trip.  We did everything:  traveled to new worlds, met mother nature personally, talked to her trees and rocks and mountains.  Practiced telepathy.  We met new people experiencing the same things as we were.  We danced.  We discovered new ways of thinking.  We bonded.  No matter what happens many years from now, The four of us will always have that night to look back upon.  Everything was perfectly synchronized.  We got into the mountains righ as we were beggining to peak.  We had just enough lsd in us to see the sunrise and try our hand at being immortal.  When it was time to call it quits and go home God sent that park ranger out to us.  Every time I listen to Tranceport I remember the feelings of this night, although they get fainter and fainter every time.  Still, I look back on it as the best night of my life.  If i were to die tommorow it would be OK because I was there, experiencing it, having more fun than anyone should be allowed to have, and knowing that only a fraction of a percent of all life on Earth has discovered what joy is.  What it feels like to awaken from the dream that was reality.  Thank you Mother Nature and Paul Oakenfold.
