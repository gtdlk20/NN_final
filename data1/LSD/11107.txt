What I experienced last night was indeed the perfect trip. I am amazed at the power of LSD to provide such a full, complex, beautiful, and important trip. I believe LSD is indeed the holy grail of psychedelics, and I can easily see why this chemical is considered by far to be the most important psychedelic in modern history. Please do not take LSD if you are looking for eye candy and a buzz; take LSD if you are ready to have your mind blown in ways you never imagined possible.
