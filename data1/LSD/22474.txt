The following day, I had a rough and unexpected come-down as a result of the acid trip, much like the low feelings one might have after consuming MDMA. I believe this was psychological rather than physical. I believe in some ways, during the trip, I felt more normal, at peace and happy than I had in a long time. This trip has given me some insight into a state of being I would like to aspire to feel while sober. Finally, whilst this trip was overwhelmingly positive and happy, I realised how fragile the day was and how easily the trip could have gone south. I am humbled by the extraordinary power of LSD.
