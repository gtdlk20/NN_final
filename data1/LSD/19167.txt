To occupy our minds for a while J put on Wasp/ Behind the Wall of Sleep/ Bassically/ N.I.B. by Black Sabbath with the Classic iTunes visualizer on.  I'm not sure at what point during the almost ten minute song I actually began tripping, but when it finished and I pulled my eyes away from the screen the effects of the acid were definitely hitting me.  The outline of my hand specifically seemed to undulate, like it was breathing.
