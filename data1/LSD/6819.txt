I think well always be in this tent, trying to meet in the middle. We arent Ryan and Emily anymore; were also my sisters and my brother and all the other people weve tripped with before, and also some kind of gods. I feel like weve been here before. I keep telling him that: Weve been here before. Havent we been here before?
