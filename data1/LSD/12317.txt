I would normally smoke cannabis at this point or earlier to help usher in the visuals and effects but have decided to refrain this time for a more pure LSD experience, and maybe leave it for the reflective comedown portion of the trip. Although I love cannabis and it undoubtedly adds something special to any psychedelic experience I suspect it can add to the confusing and chaotic aspects to a trip so will keep it to a minimum and see if I can observe any noticeable differences in clarity of trip. Its worth noting that I am a regular cannabis smoker and dont think I have ever tripped without it so this is a novel experience for me.
