I could imagine what being high and sleepy on weed would have been like, but I was so far! I was on acid, and that sight just saddened me. Weed seemed to be dull and boring, while I was in that state. Dont get me wrong, I would have gladly smoked my way out during the come down, but all the euphoria and inspiration I was feeling on acid would have been dulled out at that point, and by then I realized that this trip wasnt about enhancing visuals (which weed would have definitely aided me in), no, this trip was me exploring the realm of feelings. A realm I dont feel incredibly comfortable with on a daily basis.
