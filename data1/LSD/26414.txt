I cannot begin to describe the overshelming nature of the rhythms on my sense of perception and self, as I had become but a small part of a larger organism, locking into the various waves of harmonic existence with the various other dancers who drew higher strength from a communal language.  I am reminded of Jung's descriptions of archetypal communion inherent in every human's collective unconscious, as shapes and forms shifted from goblins to angels to the epitome of devils themselves....and yet, throughout this planescape of imagery and feelings, there was always the inherent feeling that it was all a great and beautiful part of the whole, and within this, all I can say was that it was a strange and beautiful trip, something I would love to do again, and yet, only because it reveals the beauty and horrors of this primal nature, of unimaginable strength and candor, without the candy-coating that other ravers may seek.
