Towards the end of my junior year in high school the weather started to ease from winters embrace.  Snow melted everywhere and an unusually humid breeze whistled through tall pines.  Life slowly began to breathe and flow in my small mountain town once again.  This beautiful day gave my friend and I the itch to go hiking up in the hills.  We stopped at a friend's house along the way to see if they wanted to come.  The three of them agreed and we all decided to go to an abandoned mine and explore.  One of them offered my friend and I some acid.  I had not expected to trip that day but I was handed two hits of white blotter.  I had tripped many times previously so I threw the paper into my mouth.  I thought with only two hits I would know what to expect. I was eager to go hiking.
