A little background information; At age 15, throughout the 10th grade of High School, I dropped Lucy every other day and was able to even keep composure throughout High School while doing so. Never once did I have a bad journey or anything that felt remotely wrong at this point in my life. At this point in my life I was a worry free kid. The drought set in and my life changed drastically. I got into hard shit and became very depressed with my life. My last trip with Lucy (11 days before my daughter was born) was a rough one but I had my daughters mother who I was very close with at that point to guide me through. She had also been my chemical companion throughout various past experiences.
