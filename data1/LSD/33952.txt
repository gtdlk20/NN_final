A note on this trip. At no time was this trip actually scary. I mean it was, but it was also incredible. It was extremely enjoyable. I loved each second of insane terror that was induced. It was almost too much to comprehend. I never thought that I could feel anything to this extent, and being able to almost brought tears to my eyes. It was a trip that reminded me that life is beautiful. Beauty is within everything. Don't believe me, just look at a tree for a minute. You'll find it and wonder how you could ever miss it.
