I suddenly realized someone was knocking on my door. I was relieved to find out it was just the kid from down the hall. He instantly knew we were on acid and began to smile. We invited him to spend the night with us and he took 2 hits. Seeing this I decided to get each of us another hit. So after taking that we decided to go outside. Little did we know there was a rather large amount of snow falling in our area, which made the experience wonderful. Everything was blanketed with snow, and glistening. At first I wanted to run back upstairs to grab my jacket because it happened to be a fairly cold night. However, we began walking towards this large parking lot on the campus and the longer I walked the warmer I became. Eventually I felt perfectly fine wearing a t-shirt and jeans.
