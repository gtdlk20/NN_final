I guess this is when we probably peaked (before the real abrasive rush) but I donÂ’t know it was weird and I felt like I almost had multiple peaks and things were kind of out of order but I guess that was just the cycles of acid. Even though we both took the Acid at different times we still somehow were experiencing the same effects at the same time and having the same feelings and almost same thoughts about everything and we both experienced a peak experience at this time. So ya I guess we peaked while listening to Across the Universe and it was far too profound and spiritual and meaningful to even begin to put into words and it was just truly life changing and amazing for both of us. It was one of those you had to be there type experiences, you can never know how profound and beautiful and heavenly it was if you have never experienced it yourself this moment felt like everything and like the heavens were raining down and channeling emotional beauty and good energy onto me and my being.
