As we arrived back they invited my close friend over to make sure I was okay and to me he appeared out of nowhere or a portal or something in the night and I just started yelling his name and hugging him and laughing until everyone told me to be quiet because it was late. Instead of going straight back into my mates house I stared at some trees and saw them all swirling around and animals move around in them in the dark which didn't exist. The stars seemed to draw figures and patterns and visibly move significant distances. I eventually went back into my mates house and he put some music videos on which I listened to and enjoyed but mostly tripped out hard at how many 'layers' or visual layers I was seeing in the videos.
