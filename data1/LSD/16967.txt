At one point I tried to call Erica my daughters mother again and things were slowly coming down at this point. This time she answered and I tried to tell her where I was at but she didnt want to hear me. She started screaming nonsense at me that I couldnt understand. One thing I did understand was her last line. How often in the past year have you been here for me Matt? I was there for you last time this time you are on your own.. It made perfect sense to me and I needed to hear this from her. It helped me contemplate on many personal issues and set me back on track as to what I was doing and trying to accomplish.
