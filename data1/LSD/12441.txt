Regardless of whether my Raynauds comes back, my beloved husband comes around to having kids, or any other outcome down the line goes this way or that, I feel empowered by my acid experiences. After all, I'm the man. I have a life to live, arrows to shootand stronger, healthier, happier hands with which to shoot them.
