And they both knew psychedelics very well and the way I was looking around at everything along with my pupils they saw that I was actually tripping and my other friend my close friend got happy and started saying 'wow I guess I will feel it after all' but I was still kind of worried that my friend wasn't going to feel the acid because it was out of the foil for a bit and it could have lost some of its potency and I expressed this idea to them vocally lol but we all agreed he'll still probably feel it.
