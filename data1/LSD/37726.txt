We found a party: unfortunately, it sucked, so we left. I don't remember whether I even got out of the car or not, but we went to Wendy's and three of the five people got Frostys. We then drove back to the same party, and saw some people we knew, when some old guy told us we had to leave because we were blocking the cul-de-sac or something. Once more, we got into the car, and drove to one other place where a party was supposed to be. There was nothing there, so I was brought home at about 11:30. I talked to my mom for a while (which is always cool and scary at the same time), and then I watched some television. I had a Hotpocket and a Coke, which was the first thing I had eaten since about noon.
