I looked at Guitar, the silent assassin.  He was smart, calculating, and precise.  Singer was a noble knight, a bit loud and arrogant, his intentions to change the world were righteous.  He was our leader.  I am the biggest and strongest of the group and I felt like the muscle.  My bass was a weapon of power, I had to be careful where I put the notes because I could change the edge of our weapon altogether if I wasn't careful.  Then I looked at Drums.
