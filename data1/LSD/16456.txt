Along with this euphoria and expectation, was the amazing change in the sound of any and all music.  Music was celestail, the music of gods.  In fact for weeks after I mounred the loss of those angelic ears, to hear what I still consider the true nature of music.  But all this was only a small part of what occured that day.  During the first hour, while still in a fully euphoric state, I experienced my first, shall we say, 'Acid Epiphany'.  The music we were listening to was happy and upbeat and, feeling the music as I did, I realized how numb we become to the power of music.  I dable myself and I enjoy nearly any type of music.  But seeing how commonplace music ISN'T made me wonder why we take it for granted so much.
