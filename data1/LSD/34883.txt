I go right up to one and assert, 'Angels are real!  Angels exist!'  I don't know why I said this.  I was not raised religious and did not believe in such things. It says something to me in an aside, like it doesn't want anyone else to hear, 'Well I don't doubt it.'  And then it stands aside and lets me walk out of there.
