This in itself would have been fine, but the 10 strip was just kicking in, and I knew I was in for a bit of a ride. The next couple of hours were a bit of a blur. I remember trying to get a bottle of water at one of the bars and trying to jump over the bar. The guy running it was extremely patient with me. I think. Sometime later that evening I ended up sitting on a speaker box as the beat tore through me. BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM at 138 beats a minute was rattling my soul. The world was an infinite latticework of energy, my consciousness a tiny node on a psychedelic shimmering net that stretched from alpha to omega. Time and space itself were my playthings. I could look at some person dancing on the other side of the dance floor and with the mere will for it to be, I could see into their souls. It was too much to keep my eyes open, so I lowered my head into my lap and began to watch the light show inside.
