This fear was assuaged when a friend put on Pink Floyds The Wall. We turned off the lights and lay down on the floor, and I instantly forgot my friends were with me. I was thrown into a world only Roger Waters and I understood. The entire cd is made up of a few songs, some weird sounds, and strange, hysterical voices. I felt that if I turned the cd off, I would die. I was terrified of the strange sounds, but Roger Waters voice seemed to speak to me. I felt like he was guiding me through my trip. I felt like he was guiding me through my trip. Its like he was saying, Yes, I know these noises and voices are terrifying, but dont worry, I would never let anything bad happen to you. Just stick with me, Anne. When the cd was over and the lights were turned back on, I was shocked to discover my friends were in the room. They gave me warm smiles and hugs, and told me I was doing great. I became to happy, and a single thought kept echoing over and over again in my head: You have to take care of them. I wanted to make sure they were safe and happy, and I made them swear they would wear their seat belts on the way home. I told them that my purpose in life was to take care of them and make sure they were safe and comfortable and happy with their lives.
