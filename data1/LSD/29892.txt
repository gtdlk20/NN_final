Ally takes me over the the couch and just sits with me and we fall asleep together. I only get a few hours of sleep and am recapping all the went along the following night. I am still getting a little tracers going along and think that I might be in a perma-trip. Then I say no that can't be possible, I'm just coming down it's all good. The whole car ride back to Ally's house was weirder than hell. I wasn't hallucination, I just felt all weird and tingly. After all the of passed drugs I have done I start twitching sometimes. So now I am twitching very weirdly and Ally is wondering if I will make it to her house alright.
