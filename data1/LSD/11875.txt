03:30am - Like I said, this was my first rave.  When I first arrived, I remember that the first thing I noticed was that nothing made a damn bit of sense.  It was completely silly to an extreme I had never seen before.  Suddenly though, I looked around, and it made absolute sense.  Not that any group of people there fit together, it was just that the whole thing made sense.  It wasn't about 'PLUR' like everyone says.  There were many people there being mean or rude, and many being very nice.  There were the same ratio of nice people to jackasses that there is everywhere else I go.  The way it made sense was the same way a crowd of people walking down the street makes sense.  It was just another thing people do.  As with many acid headed thoughts, it is impossible to describe in English.  One thing I distinctly remember was laughing my ass off at the thought of massive groups of people being incredibly impressed by somebody swinging around glowsticks on a string.
