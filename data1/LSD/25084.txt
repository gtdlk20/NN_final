Most acid usually takes about 45 minutes to start getting the 'acid jitters' then I'm tripping an hour after dosing. We got the jitters and the 'seeing the glue behind the wall paper' type feelings when we were leaving, 15 minutes after dosing, thatÂ’s when I knew something was wrong, after all, we only took 1 hit. By the time we were pulling into the town of my party, 45 minutes after dosing, my friend kept saying there was no roof on the car. Sure enough I looked up and I saw the roof ripping away molocule by molocule, I could see the stars outside and feel and hear the wind blowing like crazy, I looked over to my side and the entire side of the car ripped away in the same way as the roof, I could ACTUALLY SEE the plants alongside the road and the pavement we were driving over! Keep in mind this is when most acid would normally just be taking effect.
