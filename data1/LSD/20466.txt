Meanwhile my Russian friend and his mom are arguing and bickering at each other in Russian right next to the living room while this confusing messed up situation is happening in front of the T.V. on the couch with me and my tripping friend. My friend starts agreeing with me that none of this makes sense and the fact that theyre laughing at this stuff is just..so confusing and so eventually we just started laughing too lol. We started giggling at this stupid situation while looking at this guys ridiculous face. Its almost like we were laughing in sync with him and he was there with us and my friend just goes haha hes on acid and were both just laughing even the guy on the T.V. is laughing and then my Russian friend tells us to Shut the HELL UP! That is MY mothers message to you guys.
