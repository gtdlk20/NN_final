Pleasure, enthusiasm, aggression... are various places along the forward equator -- responses that propel us forward. To the side, humor, disgust. I did see some pretty disgusting things... in fact I had my first real taste hallucinations -- I tasted bitter rue! It was in a corner of the mind along with hair (sticky matted stuff like you find in drains and sinks), bubbly purplish snot, and some octopus tentacles. Yuck! But I laughed, because it was SO bad it was funny. I quickly got out of that one by swallowing it and 'recursing' up, up and away.
