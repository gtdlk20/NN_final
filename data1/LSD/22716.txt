Shortly before arriving at the trail, we pass another sign, this one put here by the state. It says, NO PARKING SUNRISE TO SUNSET. I ponder the message and think its profound that, in order for one to understand the simple instructions, one must first understand what a sunrise and sunset are. I am in awe that such a basic traffic sign relies upon the human understanding of two beautiful, cosmic occurrences.
