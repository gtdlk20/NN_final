I was on the floor trying to coax Jojo out from beneath the couch-side table in the corner and she was on the edge of the couch by the table. After a few seconds no luck, Summer gets up to go across the room to the desk to get the laser pointer (always a good way to get a cat to go where you want) and as shes getting up Summer has this acid induced vision/hallucination of Jojo leaping at her and attacking her that then set her off in a really bad way. Was like flipping a switch. I was distracted with the cat, but as she came back with the laser point I look up at her and see her face. Her eyes have this look of absolute terrified panic, like... the look of incredible fear as if she has just seen a demon or some other mind meltingly terror inducing entity. Its hard to describe but it immediately freaked me out and she begins to frantically cling to me telling me to never let go, to please, please, please, not let go of her. I grabbed her tightly, my arms around her, telling her over and over Im not going anywhere, that I wont ever let go as long as she wants, reminding her that I love her and that shes safe with me. I made sure she was safe and somewhat calmed down and got the cat out of the room.
