On a saturday about noon, I dropped 2 hits of the blotter, I turned on the tv without sound and set the stereo to a classic rock station. After an hour of thinking maybe it was bogus blotter. I felt a tingle of excitement creeping over me. As the pattern in the carpet began to dance with the music, I felt warm all over. Like an old friend gave me a hug. I watched the tv characters fumble through their roles. I even began to understand what they were saying despite the music. Everything they did was unusually funny and I rocked with laughter. I never felt so good, I was in complete control of my mind. I never felt so good, I was in complete control of my mind. As the walls shimmered and vivid color patterns danced on the wall to the music, I wondered why I had feared returning to acid land. I was the trip master. I was at the top of the world.
