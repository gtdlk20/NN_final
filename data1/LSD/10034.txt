I continued the experiments, thrusting myself into thickets and letting all of the thorns cut my body.  It just felt liberating.  My reality had truly crumbled.  I felt that now I truly 'knew' that pain and all material was a product of the mind and I didn't need to be a slave to it.  Reality was finally peeled aside, appearing as an illusion.  It's strange that as I thought this, I didn't even know my name, but I thought in terms of vedanta philosophy.
