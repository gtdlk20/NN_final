I can't find it anywhere because it's not in the foil wrapper and I'm kind of freaking out and looking for it on the ground and shit and so is my friend and we don't see it anywhere and then eventually I reach in my flannel pocket and pull out the sugar cube. I started freaking out because it wasn't in the foil like it was supposed to be and was just thinking oh shit what if it went completely bad? But my friend takes it and then laughs saying he was looking for like a 'crack rock' looking thing. He didn't think it would be an actual legit good sized sugar cube.
