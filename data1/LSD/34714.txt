11:47 pm I thought I wasnt feeling anything but my neck feels odd. I almost feel very lightly nauseous but I know it will pass I think its because I didnt eat much before only pizza about 5 hours ago. My hand eye coordination is staring to lag as noticed from typing on the computer and talking to a friend.
