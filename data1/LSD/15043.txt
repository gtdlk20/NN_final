Eventually, around 6-6:30 am, I got back to the first gas station, bought a pack of smokes and walked back to the house, where, as my visuals had quickly been receding and my state of consciousness returning to a more and more grounded place, I smoked another cigarette (wishing I instead had a bowl) and laid on the couch to watch tv in hopes that I might be able to fall asleep.
