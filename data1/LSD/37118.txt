Overall my experience was good because I finally experienced ego death and saw that rolling energy I've always read about but it was super exhausting, I'm at the point where I've accomplished all I had ever hoped to accomplish on LSD and I think I'm gonna stop with it for now and explore the peaks of shrooms. Overall 10/10
