The Om' itself would slow down extra during the song for me and be even more vibrational than the rest of the mantra sang and this is when the colors and cosmic awareness was the most intense and when these things in my head or perception were brought into existence through this vibration. The vibrations opened my perception up or something. And what do I find out months later? That this om actually represents the vibration of the universe that allows all things to come into existence..this was a real mindfuck.
