I end up getting to sleep maybe around 7:30 or 8am finally because being physically aware of all my insides wasnt really helping me get to sleep. I wake up the next day not sure if I had an afterglow or not, I probably did but I remember right after the experience happens before your mind really processes it all and breaks the whole thing down looking back on the LSD trip right after it happened it just feels like it was a crazy and vivd rush of colors and patterns and a feeling of being reborn sort of. Thats pretty much what I hear from most people right after it happens and later down the line theyll really think about the profoundness and the small differences in their everyday life. Looking back on it like a week later or something though it will register in your mind as more of just a funky mystical ride or experience. And the peak looking back still seems very geometric and heavenly. LIKE Vibrational angelic oneness. Looking back the whole experience right after it happened felt like my consciousness became this liquidy vibrating thing that was glowing (not like how you think) and patterned and it just all flowed into a complex world.
