Me, on the other hand... I was a different story that was about to turn to its climaxing page. I am known to be moody, and it isnt unusual for my state of mind to shift rapidly from hour to hour, depending on the circumstances. Acid really didnt help with that. Its little lens zoomed in that shift, and before I could even process what my name was, I was back in the feels-dimension.
