but, about an ahour and a half into the event, I noticed a very harsh, very beautiful change in gears.  In many ways, it was overwhelming, and at times, quite frightful, particularly during the darker trance tunes.  I was intoxicated by the beauty of the acid moment, without the sugar-coated overtones of ecstasy's more appealing but less powerful vibe.  At times, the room became a huge serpent, with tribal dancers riding this huge snake in cathartic rhythms of primal angst and beauty; at other times, the room soared to heights of beauty that I cannot begin to describe, reaching spiritual if not religious heights of ecstasy and harmony, as dancers probed their deepest machinery to forge a cacophony of symbiotic magic, each feeding off each other's pure energy and giving of themselves to this higher consciousness that the whole room had achieved.
