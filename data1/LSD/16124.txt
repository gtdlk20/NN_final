We began a deep conversation about LSD and movies we thought were influenced by it, and we had wondered if Fight Club was at all involved so we decided to look for it. Strangely enough, after searching the large section of DVD's, and not finding our movie, we began to walk away from the area where we saw a small stand of mixed DVD's where the bright pink soap bar held by Brad Pitt on the cover of the movie stood out to me. We quickly snatched the last copy on this stand and made our way to the registers. Checking out was a complete disaster. I could hardly keep my composure as the old woman took our money and her face melted and her smile raged with her crooked yellow, monsterous teeth.
