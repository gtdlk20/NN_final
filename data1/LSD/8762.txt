Fast forward a week and Im in her apartment hallway staring at a tiny piece of tinfoil. She said to me So, remember, theres 4 with a bear on them and 4 with just colours on them. The one with bears on them are the really strong ones, dont give them to your friends who havent done LSD before. The one without bears are... well, strong ones, ha. Enjoy! and just like that she guided me towards the door, gave me a hug and told me to take care. So begin our LSD journey. My friend who was waiting outside had a huge grin on his face; we couldnt wait to take it anymore. But we decided to at least wait till were on the bus to our friends house to take it. We came to the bus station at about 7pm. Full of impatience, we just said fuck it and went to the bathroom. Opening up this magic piece of tinfoil, we both glared down at the tabs. I carefully picked up my tab, a colourful little smiley bear was on it. I felt nervous. He took his colourful tab and we stared at each other, having second thoughts if we should do it or not (at that present moment). We did anyways, of course, and made our way to the bus stop.
