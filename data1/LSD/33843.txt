Time was totally out of whack. I did an experiment to see how long it felt like a minute passed and I looked the clock and counted to 60 and it seemed like I was counting forever. I kept getting these weird linguistic babblings in my head (I always experience this on upper doses of LSD and it actually kind of bugs me) it's like unpronounceable sentences revolving in my brain. I figured it was some kind of distortion in the way my brain was processing language so I took the time to say the alphabet a few times to make sure I still had my language faculties. I did! Whew! No brain damage for me! (?)
