At this point I was starting to get a little scared. I went down a hall looking for the door, and talked to a young lady who I did not know. I told her about my problem, but she did not understand. I did not use the correct words, because there are no words to explain the manner in which people were talking. She asked me if I needed help, needed to talk to someone, and I replied that I did not because I had the strong feeling that she was talking about police. I decided I needed to leave the house, go outside and chill out.
