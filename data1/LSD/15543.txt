Soon after this happened my friends when home and I was extremely thankful that they came along. Then a good 2 hours after that I went out for a walk in the cool evening, the sky was clear and the fresh air was fantastic. Looking up at the stars still provided me with flashes of colour and the lights in the valley looked brighter and their colours were much more intense. I basically was myself again but was just feeling very spacey and mellow, not a bad feeling really. I pondered the days experience very deeply on the walk, I felt extremely mentally drained but very relaxed. It was a truly incredible experience but wasnt something to be taken lightly, not like have a few tokes or a couple of beers to relax, it was something pretty heavy. It was like the classic drug scene from movies, the hallucinations were unbelievable. I cant say I was having debates with posters on my walls or flying gracefully down the stairs of my house on the back of a unicorn but you catch my drift.
