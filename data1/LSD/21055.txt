Everything was crazy, people are talking about parents, and I had a vision of a man who got out of sight, then BOOM!!!  I took off sprinting through the party, weaved in and out of people extremely fast, and ran out the front door and up the street.  A chain reaction went off in my head, and I subconsciously believed that I had to get out of sight because of parents.  I did not think about it, I just did it.  Ryan, where are you going? my friend Robbie yelled, chasing after me.
