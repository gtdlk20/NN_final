The parking lot showed no sign of them and quite honestly I was scared shitless. As I walked in a circle not knowing what to do I kept hearing voices from all directions whispering gibberish in my ear. I was so scared the only thing I could think about was leaving them to wonder the town with a head full of acid as I drove to the safety of my home. But I couldn't, I knew that would be a very bad idea. All of a sudden I see them walking up to the parking lot laughing and having a good time - boy was I relieved.
