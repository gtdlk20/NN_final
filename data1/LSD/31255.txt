Acid has changed me in that sense: I canÂ’t be the nihilistic, life-is-just-a-giant-absurdist-salad thinker I used to be. Sure, I still love Camus and Nietzsche, but I regained so much more belief in human relationships and connections. Especially in terms of how much we all need each other to carry out our lives, and this assigns meaning to our actions and activities - our motivation to deepen the affinities between us, and others.
