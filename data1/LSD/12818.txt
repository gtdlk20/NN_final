2:40pm: When it started there was a feeling of being very overwhelmed. Describing it simply as muscle fatigue would be inaccurate but it did seem like it, mixed with that restless leg feeling a person sometimes gets when they are very tired and haven't yet gone to bed. Instead of being in the legs however, it was in the back of my neck and shoulders. It made me tingle a little so I'd try to stretch and yawn, even take a few deep breaths to relieve it but nothing worked. I told my friend A I had this intense feeling that I needed relief from. He seemed to understand and said that the LSD was just making me feel pains that I usually ignored.
