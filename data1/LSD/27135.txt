It was the last day of my junior year in high school. A bunch of us went to the park outside of town on the hill for a picnic. It was a lot of fun, romping around the playground equipment and picnic tables and playing in the grass. After a while, we split up into two groups. Five of us, me included, went exploring at a man-made stream at the edge of the park, where a cement wall created a little waterfall. The other half of our group, which included about six people, took a van to buy some food and drinks, and cigarettes if they could find someone who sold to kids under eighteen. They were gone for about two hours.
