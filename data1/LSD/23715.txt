Some experienced substance users may find this idiotic, but I have taken LSD alone on two occasions.  I have heard from numerous sources to always have a sitter while tripping.  Believe me, I would have loved to have someone keep an eye on me, but in my world that's not possible.  All my good friends are staunch Christians and sneer at me if I even mention Cannabis, never mind LSD. I had bought 3 hits a few months ago. Due to LSD's long duration I had difficulty finding a time to trip, as I was scared shitless of a night trip turning bad. Anyway, I dropped a blotter at around 2100 one night and had a rather disappointing 20 hour trip with none of the visuals I expected, although I enjoyed my music much like a Cannabis high. My other trip was rather different.
