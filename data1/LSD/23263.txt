I soon arrived at school and sat down in class. I was relieved to see my friend who uses soft drugs as I felt connected with him at that point. I then told him to look into my eyes, which were still dilated. I told him I was still tripping. At this point I got very scared that IÂ’d get caught on a Schedule 1 drug in school by my teachers. I avoided all eye contact. I now realised that I must have been acting a little weird but at the time, I was concentrating on not looking at anyone directly in the eye.
