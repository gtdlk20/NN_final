This next part of my trip is hard to explain but let me start off by explaining our walk through this relatively short trail through this open canyon to my lower yard which is like my naturey yard behind my backyard. It was the same place we were sitting at earlier when I told my friend that I wasnt hallucinating. Well this dirt trail we were walking on only takes about 2 or 3 minutes to walk down and I know because I walk down it pretty much everyday but tonight it feels sooo much longer. I remember halfway through the walk which was only like a minute into it it felt like fucking 8 or 10 whole minutes passed by and I laughed because it had felt like forever and I saw we were only halfway and was like This is the longest walk through the canyon ever haha and he started laughing because he felt it too. It felt like the chemical was trying so hard to trip us out and trying to get us to notice strange things. All in all this 2 minute walk felt like a damn 15 or 20 minutes no joke and eventually we get to my lower yard where we were earlier and just sit there in the darkness kind of sad that there are no stars out. However its cloudy and not super dark and black like it usually is so it looks cool in its own right. Gave an almost gloomy kind of european vibe. I also saw monty python-like faces in the trees and things and saw a HUGE very well defined one on a giant pine tree that looked hyperdimensional and very tryptamine like. Things looked and felt very tryptamine-like in this part of the trip and that giant face I still see now every time I go in my lower yard and look at that giant pine tree across the way. It was very eerie and ominous and all the other faces I was seeing was giving off such a funky tryptamine alien vibe similar to mushrooms but a little different. Still almost identical visually to shrooms though in terms of seeing all those ominous faces on all the surfaces.
