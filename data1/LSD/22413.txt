I have been interested in microdosing for a while, along with much of the psychedelic community over the past few years, but have not been too interested in LSD because I have never really had a good relationship with this molecule (I usually prefer mushrooms if I want to trip).  However given the opportunity I was excited to try it.  I was told that in about 90 minutes to 2 hours I will feel increased heart rate, a change in mood, and maybe some stimulation but that I should not feel like I am tripping.
