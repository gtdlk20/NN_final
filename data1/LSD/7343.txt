What pushed the trip into negative directions at times, was a discomfort I was feeling in my bowels, due to IBS that I was recently diagnosed with. Also the aforementioned fear that my neighbours could hear me trip and the fact that we hadn't eaten anything in several hours. We only drank stupid amounts of water (1.5 litres each). I was fearing food would worsen the cramps I was having at times, also food had never tasted good while on acid before. At around 22:00 my boyfriend could't handle the hunger and made us 2 toasted ham and cheese sandwich. The smell was amazing and toasted cheese tasted otherworldly delicious. That might seem ridiculous, but acid really made me feel 'in the moment', appreciate even the tiniest of sensations, feeling grateful for the simplest of things, in this case eating a ham and cheese sandwich. I could eat so much more but again, I was afraid I'd worsen my condition.
