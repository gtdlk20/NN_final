Something interesting and kind of crazy was happening this night as well. It was a Friday night (of course because we wanted to Fry on Friday) and the girl kind of across the street (a different street) on the right side was having a big party and we all knew her personally for different reasons. I had known her the longest out of all of us, at her house they were seriously turning up and just having the hugest loudest party ever. Me and my friend who is also tripping both kind of want to go over there because it seems sort of cool and wild and were pretty good friends with her but our Russian friend had dated that girl in the past and had a bad break up and they really hated each other. Like aggressively hated each other. She even got him jumped one time right outside his house right there, my Russian friend was just kinda like Fine just go over there if you want to and started acting like whatever forget about me but me and my tripping friend knew this was an unrealistic plan and that we should just stay there and be fair anyways. There was nothing for us at that party. It was probably just full of drunk white supremacists  anyways and my other tripping friend was Mexican so that probably would have been awkward. But this part was just bumping all night like crazy so that kind of became part of our trip in a way. It was still Friday night you know?
