I think after this; after the confusing cartoonish cyclic stage or at least when it simmered down a bit is when I think things actually got really visually abrasive. I think I said that earlier but this was the even more clean and abrasive stage where everything was just so clear and this is I believe when I was seeing the faces most clearly and reminded me of my previous mushroom adventures especially the one that was across the street just about 6 months before. I remember it felt like how I would picture Ayahuasca or something to be like even though Ive never had Ayahuasca thats just how I felt it would be like. It was like a very commune cathartic cleansing experience however this LSD cleansing wasnt cathartic at all just squeaky clean and abrasive as can be visually. I think before this trip became more well defined with the faces and cleansing I got this sort of cartoonish serious monty python headfuck type feeling. Cant explain it but felt British or foreign in some way like classic wonky British humor. Very pythonesque. Like something youd see in a Beatles movie. Things at this time were also very melty and everything seemed very far from reality and normal perception visually speaking.
