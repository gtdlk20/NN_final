T+2.5 hours: This is where I really begin to lose it. I am being very over-stimulated by how bright everything is and also how hot it is and am naturally, starting to freak out a bit. The walk is very strenuous and I swear I am being pulled to the right, now entering a faster speed road by foot I am even more scared. Finally we get to my devious 300 foot long driveway surrounded by dark woods. I skeptically make it down the driveway and we go into my house. Everything is patterns and waving back and forth and nothing is how it was when I left it. Sweating like a fucking dog I slowly stumbled up the stairs into my room with my girlfriend. I am completely incoherent and can't make complete sentences or any decisions. I check the clock, it's 3:30. My dad isn't home and neither has the cop come. So I'm semi-relieved. All of a sudden, my dad knocks on the door. Now lucky for me he is a very naive man when it comes to me on drugs so he didn't even realise the fact my pupils were enormous and I was stumbling all over the place.
