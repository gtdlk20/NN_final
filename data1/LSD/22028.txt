9:45 - 10:00pm ~ The familiar and comfortable swooning, smooth body high had began. Around this time the visuals began to follow suit, starting very subtly then gaining intensity, as they usually do for me. The television screen seemes drenched in a layer of color, seeming more vibrant than before. Tendrils of various colors like red, green and bright yellow stream along the front of the screen, seeming highly noticeable, fading in and out every few seconds. I glance to the wall that is fully covered with posters, including an old Hendrix poster along with a marilyn monroe poster. They seem to be drenched in color as well, and seeming to wave and breathe up and down while still being on the wall. My friend packs a bong load with some moderate/not great quality shake weed.
