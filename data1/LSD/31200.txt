When the album ended, I found myself at a loss of what to do. The visualizer had been entertaining, but Id had enough. In the mean time, Summer had been writing haikus and lyrics, which made a lot of poetic sense, and I felt very jealous of her ability to create things that were so beautiful. I shook it off immediately, and invited her to sponge-out with me, Have you ever heard of ODDSAC? I asked.
