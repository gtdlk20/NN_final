Soon enough a huge crowd was heading our way down the sidewalk seemingly out of nowhere. W was finally starting to trip (the 2C-I took forever to hit him completely) and he got a little freaked out by the crowd. S and I stood there exchanging nods with the people in this huge group of party-crashers as they walked by. T got distracted talking to someone in the crowd, and we lost him for a few minutes. When we found him seemed pretty disoriented, so we walked down the path to the boathouse.
