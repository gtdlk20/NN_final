'LOL this is some SUPER high-octane dose, mate, I havenÂ’t even started yet...' True enough, I surf through the universe on giant waves of energy, until I am taken to another planet. This planet is so neat, all the aliens are so different, yet the landscape is similar to ours. I stroll around (feels like a stroll, but I'm flying) this planet for a while and observe. Again though, I feel that fission sensation, and the Winds on my cells pulling me Everywhere again. It was building in waves of ecstasy, like an orgasm, until again, I diffuse into the Light... Bathing in the sun... Orgasmic ecstasy...
