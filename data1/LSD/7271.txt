I told my friend B that was I feeling very lost and that he needed to stay with me.  We moved through the line (which felt like eternity), and quickly left the store.  Out in the parking lot, J and B met up with their dealer and purchased their weed.  We drove to our friend's house and went into his basement at around 4 PM.
