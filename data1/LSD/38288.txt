I drank a big cup of orange juice to help kick in the effects (I don't know if that really works) and waited. Twenty-five minutes went by and I didn't feel a thing. I thought we got ripped off and my homie says, 'He said this shit was potent.' And I said, 'Man, we took 3 doses and I ain't feeling shit.' Five minutes went by and I realized how wrong I was. This shit had me on a 14 hour trip. In the peak I saw everything in a glittery glow and everything I looked at began to melt. My bro and T said they felt it too. They said they saw tracers and my brother said that he felt like he was melting. It was insane.
