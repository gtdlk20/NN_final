We are now wandering around completely helpless around Cedar Point hallucinating, disoriented, lost, and un-functional.  C suggests we ride a ride and I tell him we need to find S.  I try to explain that we just took someone from a different state and dropped him off at an amusement park.  C doesn't seem to grasp the idea and continues suggesting we just ride rides and don't worry about it.
