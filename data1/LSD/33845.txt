I started zoning out some more and just felt totally weird. I was thinking some very far out shit like, because I was thinking certain ways and certain things (things I can't exactly remember), the day would not end. Night would never come and it would be perpetual day forever. Time lagged on and seemed to reaffirm this notion. I somehow managed to remember that my mom and step-dad were supposed to be coming home and if they DIDN'T come home as expected and day DIDN'T end, then I would have something to worry about...until then I would just not worry about it. I also was thinking about some of my family members and all the dysfunction in my family and how I was seemingly trapped in the karmic cycles of my upbringing. For me to explain this I would have to tell my whole family history, which I'm not going to do.
