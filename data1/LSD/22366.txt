My boyfriend A tried to put on a cartoon show on my computer but dissatisfied with this turn of events, I left A and C and laid down on my mother's bed. I laid there for I don't know how long, it felt like 20 minutes, but could have been longer or shorter. I watched the shadows from the TV dance on the wall and my arm hairs tower from me. I relaxed and thought about nothing, really. And I enjoyed not thinking about anything, for usually it's that I have too many thoughts on my mind at all times.
