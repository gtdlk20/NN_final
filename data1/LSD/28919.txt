D had gotten the idea of cutting the glowsticks and throwing the liquid all on the sides of the pitch black tunnel. After he had opened about 4 of them and covering the walls with the liquid we turned off the light again. Stars... All I could think of is stars. I stared strait at 1 in particular start and it didnt move but everything around it was morphing trying to take the star I was looking at but concentrating on it was the only thing keeping it still. I close my eyes and the only thing that changed was the stars were gone.
