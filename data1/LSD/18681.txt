S decided it was time to head outdoors for a nice stroll before we went to our planned location (a local art museum was having an amazing exhibit of Modern Abstract art, Dali, Van Gogh, Etc.) When I reached the outside I was completely overwhelmed by how beautiful the world looked, I had to actually turn away from the sun. The entire sky was morphing and moving like I had never seen, the trees swaying back and forth looked so graceful and beautiful.  We began walking towards the Lagoon, a pond with willows and other trees all around it. Along the way we stopped many times to just gaze away and really take it all in. (this is about 3-4 hours into the trip) We reached the lagoon and began to stroll around. The ripples in the water seemed to literally come at you, like I could actually feel them getting closer to me. Every tree had its own face and what looked like little mouths all over them.
