This experience was also kind of sad too but so sad it was beautiful like listening to a sad but beautiful piece of music that just evokes so much emotion. This kind of gloomy sadness seems to be a characteristic of acid and even loomed over the rest of the experience but in a beautiful profound way. It was like a really profound sadness. Similar to the feelings of extreme humility than can come with mushroom trips especially when you start thinking about all of humanity and its sins. Makes you wonder if sadness is really a negative emotion or not and the feeling of sadness and joy and beauty seemed to mix or be one.
