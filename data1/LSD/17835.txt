As happened in our last trip, the effects took about an hour to really get rolling/started but once they did they were very apparent. Laying on the floor together looking at the ceiling which has a soffit running down the middle, and seeing it get wavy and pulse slowly, I knew we were well on our way. Throwing on a YouTube playlist with good music/visuals, we laid around enjoying ourselves on the floor or the couch talking about stuff and just enjoying the sights as they started to manifest.
