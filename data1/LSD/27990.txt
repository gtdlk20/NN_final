Let me just say now that most of the events of that evening are fuzzy to various degrees. Anyway, after splitting from my family, I wandered the ship, getting deeper and deeper into the A. I made my way to a cafeteria on the second highest deck, one with windows for the walls. Luckily, it wasn't very occupied. Only a few other people sat at one other table there, speaking some other language. Hell, I remember it being Spanish, but it really could have been anything, or nothing.
