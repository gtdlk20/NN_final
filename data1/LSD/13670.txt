4 hours after dosing: I went downstairs to find that Drew had gotten home from his adventure. He was tripping real hard, and told me that the cops had pulled him over, but because he was crying so much they didn't notice he was tripping. He told me that it was almost impossible to drive, that all the street lights were creating these long trails and everything was so blurry. He said that dealing with his girlfriend was really hard, and that her emotions were very strange to him, while on acid. I congratulated him on surviving the police encounter and his girlfriend, then we went upstairs into his bedroom, and smoked some marijuana with Brandon.
