The walk home was phenomenal.  Whenever I used to do acid, the whole time-era I was in went back to the 1950s as everything became black-and-white, and the streetlights gave a neon tint making the whole world be in pure technicolor.  So many mad incomprehensible occurance took place like a huge friendly Great Dane in the middle of nowhere with no owner with it.  Imagine that, walking down a country road and fields far miles from any houses and a huge Great Dane comes up to greet you.  This was obviously a stray dog but the coincidence of us tripping as well was mad!!  And we were still getting higher and higher on acid...
