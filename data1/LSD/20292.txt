Finally got my courage up and began walking around with the candy in my hand.  Taking the plunge, I popped it in my mouth and chewed it.  Tasted just like a regular candy.  Hmmm... was this good or bad?  Took some pictures for facebook while I was at it.  Since I couldn't find anyone to trip with, I figured I'd at least have my facebook friends.
