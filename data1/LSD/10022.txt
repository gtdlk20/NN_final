A very young German man I met in a small himalyan town gave me a hit of acid, and warned me 'This is VERY special acid. Maybe only take half.'  Seeing the tiny hit of blotter, I truly had my doubts that it could have much effect on me.  I've tripped many many times.  I was very wrong about the acid.  It was stronger than anything I've ever had by a long shot.  And that was from one hit!  I was also having numerous stomach problems at the time, which is a common experience in India.  I was taking some antibiotics which were very strong.  I wonder sometimes if this had a chemical reaction with the acid, strenthening it considerably.  It may just have been truly special acid.  I don't know.  I tend to think that it was because of my intense practice that month with vedanta, which relaxed me to the point where some acid thrown in the mix would trigger a full on psychedelic blow out.
