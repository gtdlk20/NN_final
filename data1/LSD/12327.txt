T+3.00: LSD is a gentle slope towards the peak, I think Im there until BAM, I reach the summit and witness the vistas bellow realising that NOW Im there. I decide to hold back on the joint for now and see where this takes me. Everything has become touched with beauty and detail. I found myself looking at a photo of the Bayon Temple in Angkor Wat, the still and smiling faces of Bodhisattva forever at stillness in the rock, there is a deep serenity to be found in just being. Humbleness, kindness, compassion and intent are the keys to happiness.
