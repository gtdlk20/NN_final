We then drove down to the lake and got out for a look see. It was 4 am and light was just starting to appear over the mountain. Nothing much was happening we sat on a bench played frisbee and walked around. At about 5 the sun started to come over the mountain and that's when it started. I kept seeing these shapes of gods in the sky and the trees but not only where they moving but they were dancing as if there was some kind of music playin. This was just the start the dancing and movement of the gods intensified and there were more of them dancing and swaying to the music. Not one single god was the same, some were smaller some took up half the sky but they danced together constantly. Then in the trees I saw purple and yellow elephants shrinking and spliting into 2 and multiplying over and over again. All I could do was sit there and watch this happen. It seemed to calm down as the sun eluminated everythign.
