After a while A gave into C's demand and took him down stairs to watch the movie while me and B chilled upstairs. Me and him were disusing that this entire situation was completely fucked and the vibe was so weird. We said that we didn't want to be there. From what I was told by A, C was being to loud downstairs so they came back upstairs and that is when things went into a spiral of horror.
