Sometime deep into the climax of my LSD intoxication I was sitting in a living riving on a wooden chair. For some reason I was looking at another chair sitting somewhere in the middle of the room. This chair was a computer desk chair, a chair with four wheels and spins. It was facing me. However, I imagine the description is not too important. So, I was looking at this chair when I noticed something very odd. Everything started to rotate. I wasn't moving, but everything I was looking at, in example the chair, was rotating in all directions from one point. This startled me a little bit because I was seeing the backside of the chair, even though the FRONT was facing me. [NO, the chair itself was not moving!] The rotation speed seemed to speed up until I realized that I was seeing the chair, and the rest of the room, at every possible three-dimensional angle at once. It is extremely hard for me to describe what seeing the chair and the rest of the room from every possible angle was like.
