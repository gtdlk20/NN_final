We reached the park and lay in the grass on a slope for who knows how long. The usual time distortion I get on trips was stronger than ever.  Deep relaxation spread through me in waves as I looked up at the sky through leafless tree branches.  Orgasmic isn't quite the word for that feeling.  Physically I melted away, and my 'less aware consciousness' melted away too.  after that I percieved what I've only percieved a handful of times in my life (with and without drugs).
