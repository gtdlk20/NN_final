I'm 15 an I live in manchester,england and I had a fucking weired experience on holiday in majorca.I was out on the beach one morning when a guy came up 2 me and asked if I wanted sum 'stuff' he then whiped out a bag of skunk and some blotters,I was aprehensive about the acid as I had never tried it before but I decided to buy a couple of trips and some skunk.Later at the hotel I met up with a friend and had a couple of joints out of the window.I then took a tab in the lift.When I got off I saw a hypnotist in the bar asking for volenteers,so naturaly I got up there.He told me I was going to give up smoking, so he sat me down and he told me to  close my eyes and let my mind drift,which was easy as I was stoned and hallucinating slightly!!! I then found my self in the most relaxed 'floaty' mood I have ever experienced in my life.The colours were drifting round my face,I wasnt sure if I was in a trance or tripping.Next thing I remember was waking up in my room 6 hours later totally awake and alert. I was told the next day that the hypnotist couldnt wake me and a doctor had been called!I have recently tried to recreate this experience with no effects near the ones I experienced before.
