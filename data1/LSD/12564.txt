I was a boy, in the garden, full of curiosity. Just like the fallen boy and so many others. Like all of them, I held potential to effect society in innumerable ways for better or worse. But again, She reminded me, I could always return to this state of innocence. So, too, She reminded me, could even have all of those I judged as having betrayed the cause. I was no better or worse than anyone else apart from the choices I made; but even then, even if I truly messed up and made a disaster of my life  something I dreaded  She would always welcome me back to this state if I was willing. I promised her I always would be.
