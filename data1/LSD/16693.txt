Once my hands warmed up I played a little guitar before laying down and cuddling with Jess until the rest of our party returned from the hot springs.  Everybody seemed set on going to sleep, so although we weren't tired Jessica and I went to my tent and got in our sleeping bags to stay warm.  After just laying there for a while we both decided that we were not going to sleep and that cuddling had been nice.  We unzipped our sleeping bags and put them together, holding eachother and carressing eachothers backs and hands all night.  It was very intimate and comforting, and turned out to keep us much warmer since the night got very cold.  I felt very close to my friend, and my feelings for her grew quite a bit over the night.
