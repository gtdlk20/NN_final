At work, I'm a cashier. So, I had to interact with people a lot. I didn't like that idea. You could tell a difference in the way a talked to people. I'd try to avoid people, customers, and employees. My manager said I looked tired. I told her that I was out late last night. The effects completely whore off over the next couple hours at work.
