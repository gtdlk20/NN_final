T 1:30-2:30 - I arrive at my house and greet my dog, a shaggy, black-haired dog who is always around me.  He has smoked with me on a lot of occasions and I believe he enjoys the habit.  Whenever I arrive home from school, I always take him outside and rip a bowl before my mom gets home.  He sits right beside me and looks up at me, eager to get a shotgun.  It is now snowing very hard, and I look outside to see that my car is completely covered, so I decide to take my bong out and box it up.  My dog is terrified of the snow, so he wouldn't come along.  I enter my car and put in some Grateful Dead to back my trip.  I proceed to smoke at least an eighth of pot, and by the time I exit my vehicle I am tripping exceedingly well.  I decide that it's such a nice day, so I should go for a walk.  I grab my iPod and go walk around my neighborhood, which is a truly gorgeous piece of land, with tall trees, nice houses, and woods surrounding it.  I walk around for about thirty minutes but decide to go back inside cause I was cold.
