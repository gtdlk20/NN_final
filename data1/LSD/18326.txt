I felt a lot more at ease with the rest of the world and felt so much better as a whole.  I dont think I could classify my experience as a bad trip but I know it wasnt good.  It was somewhere in-between.  More likely a borderline bad trip.  Ive decided though that whenever I do acid again Im not going to take the same dose as I did that night, Im going to dose myself a bit lower and Im going to take a break from it for a week or two just to give my head sometime to think and recoup.
