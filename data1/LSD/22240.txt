The next morning I awoke shaking, I got out of the tent and walked to the bathrooms. On my way a group of people stopped and asked me if I was ok, I said yes and realized I must look like absolute shit from the complete and utter mind fuck that had taken place the night before. I thought I had a bad trip, I now realize thatÂ’s completely opposite of what happened. I reached who I really am as a person and am forever changed by the first night of Bonnaroo 2009.
