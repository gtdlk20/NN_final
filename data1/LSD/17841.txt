Summer Thoughts: "The difference between 150ug and 250ug when it came to visuals and sounds was considerable. 150 had patterns manifest on surfaces and behind closed eyes, but 250 felt like visuals were overlaying your entire vision. Everywhere I looked, patterns and rainbow swirls took over, and the more I let my vision space out, the more intense it got. Meanwhile, sound was getting very distorted. Sometimes it felt like sounds were coming out of boxes, or that things were stuttering. We could feel the nature of sound change if we held a cup close to our ears. At one point, music didnt even sound like music anymore as it was so choppy, pitch shifted, warbley, and just outright chaotic. Couple this with synesthesia and suddenly I was seeing sounds, feeling smells, hearing visuals all while my brain was highly influenced by any change in mood or emotion. Every sensory input was felt throughout all of my senses and it was such a profound experience. Its one of those things you truly need to experience to understand."
