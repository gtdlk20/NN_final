I think the repeated use of acid has given me HPPD (I don't quite remember what it stands for but it means that I have some effects of acid while I'm not tripping). Basically, I see patterns all over lots of things during the day and can see a spirit that stays with me most of the time (the spirit isn't evil, but I'm not sure if it's good either) (I hope I didn't lose credibility with this statement, but it's the truth. There's an orb kind of spirit and we communicate usually at night). Also I have that thing where some things look huge and some things look small (Like I see buildings but they seem like I could crush them with my foot).
