At the time of last ingestion I was 19. A buddy and I, experienced trippers, went up to the lake for a night of chillen and trippen. The whole evening went as planned. A fire for comfort, outside for peace of mind, and acid for the show. Each hour melted into another and before the millionth thought had melded with the ten millionth it was light. Time to head back to life and town. Each hour melted into another and before the millionth thought had melded with the ten millionth it was light. Time to head back to life and town. We paused to look at the sand under the water and ponder just how all the little valleys and towns had formed below the surface...very interesting at the time. Out of nowhere,(I say nowhere because the night had gone so well), blickity blam...........the sickest feeling in the world hit me. It was despair, fear, and evil rolled into one thought and then injected into my soul. I turned and looked at my bro.....his eyes reflected the same intensness that I was feeling. Before I could ask him he said ' Something is wrong...do you feel it?'.
