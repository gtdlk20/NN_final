When we got back to my house, that's when things started getting weird.  I had forgotten that we had set up black lights and posters all over my living room to celebrate the occasion.  So when I walked into the house, I was completely weirded out.  The colors from the posters were swirling around and moving all over the ceiling and floor.  I started to get scared, and had this thought in my head that my two friends were going to kill  my cousin and I.  I guess the power of suggestion was enough to freak her out as well, because we both ended up in the bedroom trying to climb out the window.  I have never felt so terrified in my life.  At that moment, I truely belived my own insane thoughts.  My friends came in and freaked when they saw me dangling half out the window.  After fighting with them briefly, I agreed to go back out and sit in the living room.  The black lights and posters were more vivid than ever...I remember looking at one and seeing a plane flying towards me.  I got all emotional and started crying.
