LSD was never really available to me though it recently has.  I have only used it a few times and on my fourth use I took a single hit that was of moderate strength and then another approxamitely three hours later.  After tripping for a very long time and eventually coming down and passing out, I awoke to find that I still had visual 'trails'.  It is very similar to the effect that the mouse pointer is capable of doing.
