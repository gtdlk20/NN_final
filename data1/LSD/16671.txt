My first time using LSD was one of the most amazing experiences of my life time.  I have been smoking pot for quite some time and just started experimenting with halluginegens.  I had tripped on mushrooms and salvia divinorum several times and DXM once before I decided to try acid.  My friend called me to tell me he could get me some acid if I wanted it, so I bought 5 hits for myself and was planning on taking it the next day before going to the Camp Verde hot springs to camp.  When I told my friend Jessica she got very excited so I talked to my friend again and bought 5 hits for her too.
