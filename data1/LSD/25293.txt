Trip#2:  our second acid trip took place the night before last.... completely by surpise we came across someone selling acid, and along with a friend bought a few hits... we all took our hits at about 10:30pm, and the effects came on extremely quick, at about 11:30, I was steadily climbing into euphoria.  We watched the cartoon Spirited Away, and it was even more enjoyable that usual.  It was our friend's first time, and he was hilarious, pacing around speaking in a various accents (when he could force himself to speak) and puffing on a cigar.  This trip wasn't nearly as intense as the last, but that was good. it was easy to control, and alot mellower.  It was raining outside, but I went out and visited the tree anyways. it was beautiful, being pulled by the high winds of the storm..... my fiance and I had a serious god/goddess theme again this time, and it was very religious, and opened my eyes even further....  spent most of the night in the bedroom, which has been completely redone in natural decor so it was far more pleasant, and candle lit...  we painted each other with various religious symbols and laid around chilling out having a wonderful time.
