A month later I was visiting with my parents, the psychosis started slowly; little things like forgetting where I put things, deep vivid daydreaming that I almost couldn't wake up from, then the voices started. I could hear people say my thoughts, the madness of voices in my head, slowly I couldn't recognize my own family and had involuntary movements of my arms. During a lucid moment I told my parents I needed to go to the hospital. At that time the hallucinations were so intense, I'd see snakes crawling all over me, worry that I had bugs (I really didn't), the maddening voices, the constant movement of things around me, it was pure hell. Doctors put me on strong medicine that did not stop the hallucinations but weakend my ability to feel anything emotionally, shutting down all my thoughts. I started noticing if I was in a good mood the hallucinations would be silly causing me to laugh, but if I was in a bad mood I was in for a really rough time.
