We're back into town now, and I decide I would like to visit my friends party for a few minutes. Jim and Wally aren't really up to it but fuck them, I'm driving. It was a couple of days before Halloween so of course this was a Halloween Party. I park and the others decide they want to walk around while I'm at the party. That was cool with me so we parted ways for a second.
