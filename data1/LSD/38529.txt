How incredibly naive. We proceeded to break a lot of other things in his home, spit on the walls, pour beer everywhere, unleash gigantic bags of tea into the air, and cover all of the walls with psychotic gibberish in crayon. Actually, I only broke the glass door with the chair and my friend did all of the other stuff while I lay in the bottom of his shower... water blasting, curled up naked in a fetal position sucking my thumb. A baby once again...
