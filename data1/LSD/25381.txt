My second experience with acid has been, to date, my most signifigant and was a transformative event in my life.  Before that point I had a healthy respect for the drug but perhaps not to the extent I should have. At the time I was doing relatively well financially so taking a pharmacopia of drugs into a rave wasn't unusual for me.  I would bring some for myself and enough to resell at cost to several dozen of my friends.  I wasn't interested in making a profit, just in buying affection.
