My room's center table retracts its legs and begins to float into the air. The Capri Sun's drink art of a beach part turned into an alien acid drinking bath. Cars outside sound like space ships launching at hyperspeed. My speakers fill with color, flowing like a DDR step chart with 50 feet in multiple ways. My icons on my desktop float, as if bobbing on top of the water. It becomes absolutely obvious how the Beatles were influenced by psychedelics. The album art of Revolver shows just how much these guys were directly influenced by this type of thinking. As I listen to several Beatles songs (Strawberry Fields Forever, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Taxman, etc.), the pictures I am staring at literally come to life. Focus shifts in the photographs - I can see and feel the wind pushing elements of the trees in pictures. Top-down, aerial photographs of the Earth warp into 8-bit style pieces of art. I find it particularly amusing how I can transform pictures at will into cartoons / 8-bit creations. One extremely memorable hallucination was watching a picture of the coast of California turn into top-down Starcraft-style spaceships engaging in war, while transporting troops on a dynamic playing field.
