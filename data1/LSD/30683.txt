I mean, fuck... where to begin? After we each ate half a tab (cut from a long, unperforated strip) at 8:30 PM, we walked through a nearby park and watched the sunset. After that, we played basketball until 9:45. We got back to the house and each ate another half, doubling our original dose, but it still took until 10:45 or so for things to feel trippy and for a while I was disappointed that we had taken bunk acid. By 12:00 AM, I was probably as fucked up as IÂ’ve ever been.
