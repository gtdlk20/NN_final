I realized that S was no longer with us and looked up to see if I saw him.  As soon as I looked up I saw the clouds and there were rainbows everywhere in the sky.  My vision was made up of a bunch of colored diamonds that were shrinking and enlarging rapidly.  I started to hear noises from people in the park.  I could hear everyone who was in about a quarter mile range and all the voices were echoed and distorted so I couldn't make out what they were saying but it started to scare me.  I begin to worry that this could be a bad trip.  I ask C if he wants to stay at the beach with me and he's confused and says we can't waste this trip by staying at the beach.  I agree for some reason and we make our way to the sidewalk.
