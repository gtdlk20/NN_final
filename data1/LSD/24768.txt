Unfortunately, they were still talking garbage. People got into their cars and I asked one of my friends where we were going. He urged me to get into the car I had come in. I decided this was a good idea and did so. I thought that they would just drive me back to this house after driving around the block a few times. I asked them to stop the car so that I could get out. The driver said 'ok he has 15 seconds to get out or I'm taking off again'.
