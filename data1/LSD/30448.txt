I had been planning to trip for a few days but things kept coming up and ruining it. I'm fairly new to LSD, this trip being accounted was my 3rd time using the benevolent Lucy (as she will now be reffered to from here). Even tho I have only used Lucy a total of 4 times as of right now (June 25, 2008) I know her power and I respect her benevolence, teaching, and knowledge. I am currently reading the Teachings of Don Juan and as it teaches to be a Man of Knowledge you need an Ally and I have chosen Lucy as mine, or should I say she has chosen me.
