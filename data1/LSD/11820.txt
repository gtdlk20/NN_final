Lots of bad stuff happened too. I had to deal with some intense paranoia, and ride home with my dad. I also got a true feeling of who I was. It was unnerving, and I now realize that I DO have to improve myself personality wise. This can be a devestating revelation to have on LSD. Luckily the band switched tunes here, a testamant to how easily I can be swayed by external factors. I think I need to wait until I have a better grip on my world before doing this again. I am not 'unstable', but I am still not fully realized as an individual. Beautiful as they can be, mind altering chemicals should be kept to a minimum for me until I straighten myself out a bit. Also, tripping around parents is BAD. I cannot tell you the fear I felt in that car. I'm very lucky my old man wasn't tired and didn't ask me to drive. So I don't know. was this a good trip, or a bad trip. The answer: It was a trip. nuff said.
