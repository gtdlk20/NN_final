We were pretty much waiting for it to hit us while watching tv, an hour passed and nothing.....and hour and a half passed, a slight head-ache but nothing....2 hours passed which made it about 5oclock with no effects what so ever. We then began to think that nothing would happen so I remembered about some weed we had stored away for a rainy afternoon, we got it and started to roll out some joints.
