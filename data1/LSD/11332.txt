I first saw a fat woman whose car had aparently broken down. I laughed at her from a distance. She saw me an I didn't stop or even care. It was beautiful. 'That's what she gets for bringing that huge hunk of metal out here. This is no place for an automobile.', is what I was thinking. We got back to the shelter and there were people with their arms around each other's shoulders sitting on the swing near the overlook of the river. This was funny, so I laughed as hard as I have ever laughed and stumbled around in extreme amusement. I then proceded to annoy them with music. It wasn't my intention, it just played out like it was. Techno was on the menu and I was definitely craving something phat. Hard trance at first. The people soon walked to their car and drove away. And with the fat woman long gone, we noticed we were alone again. No more worry about being freaks to these people. But of course they were a lot freakier to us.
