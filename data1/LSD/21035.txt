Everything was going very well.  After dinner, my friend and I walked upstairs to use the restroom.  It was around 9p.m., an opportune time to take the LSD I planned on eating.  At once, I ate all five hits that I had folded in a piece of paper in my pocket.  Was that three? my friend asked.  No, five I said.
