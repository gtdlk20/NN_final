Another thing, associated with that, that I witnessed was that when I kept it on, it created a vortex around my computer in which colors from around my room and my computer wallpaper were being sucked into it and thrown out around my room. I vividly remember my girlfriend being enveloped in the colors from my wallpaper (purple, green, red, blue) being thrown across the room and changing the color of her hair. Another awesome and funny thing I witnessed was urinating. Every time I would pee I would watch as urine would come in a stream out of my belly button, penis, and knees. Urine would also flow (visually) over the sides of the toilet and down the walls. When I splashed water on everything, water started pouring down the walls.
