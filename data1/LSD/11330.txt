As we were staring at the sky, the nothing morphed into a huge beautiful cathedral. Pink walls and purple columns. It was mesmerizing to say the least. The peak was begining to go away so we looped around to the shelter where we had begun our adventure. Taking the back way of course. When we got back to our suprise, it was later in the day and people had showed up to enjoy themselves at the pretty park. They wern't enjoying it on the level that I was. They were there to abuse and I could smell it on them.
