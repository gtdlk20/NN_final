Like it just put me in this phenomenological trance which then put me into the dream mindset? But I remember how just by entering this mindset and this 'dream' headspace I was somehow able to know and internally confirm that I had remembered details from a REAL dream that I had had that I couldn't remember sober and I was also somehow able to understand that this dream had happened so many times before and that the dream headspace was so strange yet so familiar and so bizarre to be experiencing while supposedly wide awake in your Russian friend's kitchen. Or dining room whatever but it doesn't matter because I had completely forgotten that I was in that dining room there with them I don't even think I knew if I was awake or not. Dreams and dreaming have never been the same for me since this experience. I don't know how long that whole trance or whatever lasted but it couldn't have been that long because when I snapped back to reality in the most sudden and puzzling way ever I saw they were still having a conversation and smoking I believe I turned down the bong for a certain amount of time up to this point. I was no longer interested in anything to do with weed. Apparently my close friend was though because he really wanted to feel the LSD and he figured smoking would boost everything which he was right...
