I really wish I hadn't smoked because it blended the onset effects of the LSD.  I am not sure when the LSD started and the weed took effect, and when the weed wore off.  Within twenty minutes of administration most of my decision making capabilities were eliminated.  For nearly an hour I sat listening to music and watching music visualizations trying to experience what sound could look like and what colors could sound like.  It is a blending effect.  Needless to say if my friend didnt encourage me to take a walk I would have been content to sit on that couch for the entire trip.  I could not pick a game to do, or decide on something to watch. In fact it took every effort of my body just to read the 15 titles of my dvd collection to my friends.  Just like high doses of marijuana LSD had my mind racing uncontrollably.  I would think of one thing and then get sidetracked and think about another.  That is why I believe it is called a journey.  I got tired from all the thinking (about nothing coherant) but couldnt turn it off.  Hallucinations did presist.  I never saw anything that did not exist, but things were moving.  Doors gained a curved shape, and lights seemed to have tails.
