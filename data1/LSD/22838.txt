We drove every now and then for the rest of the night, sometimes with me standing on the roof. Even though we were only moving at around 10kph, I still knew this was a silly and immature idea, but it was still amazingly fun. My friend at one stage also lost my ipod in the middle of a massive grass paddock, and then found it (Don't ask me how). I proceeded to drive back to the rave, steering the car with my teeth. We laughed at how stupid this was, yet fun.
