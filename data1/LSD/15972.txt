This ride took me to a third planet. Here, however, gravity did apply to me, and I was quite heavy. There were these angry, shape-shifting aliens again, and this time they chase me. I start running away, only to see that I too am shape-shifting this time. My leg goes through my chest and turns into an arm, all my arms turn to legs and I run on all fours, shifting and shifting until the aliens catch me. This was Not pleasant. I could feel very malicious intentions from them. They bound me and were getting ready to do who knows what with me. At this point I felt my control of the trip being restricted, so I had to change environments into where I have more control. I convince myself that this is acid, and I can get away.
