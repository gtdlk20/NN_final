There was an intense sensation of deja vu with this trip.  There was an intense sensation of deja vu with this trip. Not like the regular deja vu when I feel like I've been here before or are re-experiencing a memory. Rather it was like I have had a very similar trip before with the same after image affects and the same distortions and emotional intensity. But I have never done 4 tabs of LSD or any similarly strong substance before. I couldn't place it nor explain it. It seems like I've watched movies or shows with these same effects in them but the references escape me, except maybe the scene in the movie Wanted where he shoots the wings off of the flies. There was no describing the level of familiarity I felt, almost like a lost memory just below the surface.
