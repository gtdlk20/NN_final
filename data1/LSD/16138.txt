Matt turned to me several times asking what was going on, and repeated the previous funny phrase of 'Am I alive, dead, or backwards?' I had found that he was still in this bad trip partially and it took me many minutes to coerse him out of his dying head trip. He was still pretty out of it when his mother announced that she wanted to use the treadmill in the basement. So I decided to remove him from this potentially disasterous situation with a breakfast invitation that he quickly took and followed me to his front door.
