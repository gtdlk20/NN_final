I began walking looking at the trees and the sky feeling refreshed and revitalized. It was a perfect day out, high 84 and the sun was shining and there was a ever so gentle cross breeze blowing. Anyways I began walking up my neighborhood and out onto the back streets. I came to some wild flowers and looked at them and was reminded of Hofmann saying that we need to come back to the roses, the plants, to mother nature. I brushed them with my fingertips and smiled. I kept walking and as I came to about 100 yards to the trail I looked at my cell fone and it was 1:07, the time I was planning to drop (military time its 13:07, my two lucky numbers :). I took out the first one, un folded the foil it was in and placed it on my tongue. I moved it around, pressed it to the roof of my mouth for a few minutes, took a small sip of water to make sure it went down. Then I repeated it with the second dose.
