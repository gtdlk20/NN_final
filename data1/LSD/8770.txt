We finally got to the house, where there was good vibes everywhere. All my friends were there, the atmosphere was good and I was on acid. It really began to take a hold now. I saw kaleidoscopes everywhere. My bodily feelings spiralled out of control. I just wanted to stretch and touch everything, my teeth felt really sharp and kind of sore. My hands numb. I didnt care, I felt completely at one with the world. I handed my friend his tab of acid. Now there was 3 of us whod be on acid. Nothing much happened for a while, me and my other tripping friend just enjoyed the patterns everywhere and kept having laugh attacks, which felt amazing by the way. Another friend arrived at the house to pick up his 2 tabs of acid. We offered him to trip with us, but he declined. Thats cool, hes got things to do and places to be. While we were all having a cigarette in the living room, the friend that arrived began to talk about the acid experience. He was somewhat experienced with it, having taken it 5+ times. He said When on acid, youre like a little school child. Anything can you make laugh, take these 2 idiots for example (referring to us) He began to smile really widely and waved his arms about. Me and my friend exploded into laughter. I just couldnt help it, he looked so silly. We begged him to do it again and again until he finally said Im not gonna be your personal clown for the night! Later guys! and like that he left.
