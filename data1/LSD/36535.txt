The drug simply made me think, for a really long time.  I was awake for hours having these seemingly in depth conversations with my friend.  At one point at about 6:30 am, we went outside to watch the sunrise and I was awe stricken and humbled by the heavens above.  At one point a jet passed by and it was so intense I fell to my knees.  I was simply humbled by the drug, and was not getting any visual affects from it.  My friend took the same dose, and he's done LSD many times before, and he tripped pretty hard, so I know the acid was good.
