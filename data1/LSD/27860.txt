At this point my already racing treadmill of a mind was blazing. It was approx. 2:00 when we had returned to the campfire. We decided to lay down and relax. From there I was taken into depths of undescribable and unforseen places. Were they places of my mind or other demensions I don't know because 'I' was not concious or attentive during the period of 2:30-6:00. The eyes simply observed as my usually racing mind apparently stopped doing and started being. No deadlines, no worries, no emotions, just existnece in as far as I have yet experienced it's purest form.
