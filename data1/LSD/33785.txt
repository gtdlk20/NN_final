I then went to talk to my other friends. The guy who took 6 hits was totally out of it. He was going nuts, in a good way. All the wall paper on my walls, and just about every surface was either breathing or moving in some sort of weird way. We were outside for a bit when it started raining, and that felt very good. I could go on countless hours about the visuals I saw, which were so amazing, but I won't. I called a sober friend of mine, just to see what she would sound like while I am tripping. That kind of kept me in a 'peaceful' state of mind since I knew that everything was not going crazy, and that I will still come down when it is over which kept me in a good mood. She stayed on the phone for nearly 4 hours with me, listening to me babble on, even putting the phone down for 20 minutes straight at 3:00 in the morning! That is truly a good friend, as I know I was probably scaring her with everything I said, but she enjoyed talking to me while I was tripping and I did too.
