The second reason comes in handy, because it also provides some backstory for some of the things that I saw, and felt, during the trip. Earlier on the month, Id began a sexual relationship with this guy called Seth. I, stupidly enough, fell head over heels for him. I think everyone around me realized that he didnt care for me... except for me. Dont get me wrong, I had reasons to believe that wasnt the case, but I was somewhat blinded by other convictions as well. When we tripped, I hadnt seen Seth for about two weeks, and we were no longer involved, as he had ditched me accidentally one night, and I had decided Id had enough, so I deleted his number and texts from my phone. Summer had run into him, and he kept claiming he was going to reach out to me, but when I contacted him and was ignored, I decided to let it go and give up. It wasnt easy, and I kept blaming myself for it, seeing Seth as a special, wasted opportunity I had thrown away. I was simply unable to move on, or realize better would have come along eventually. Because both Mark and Seth were film students, they shared a lot of classes, which brought about a certain hostility between them. Mark despised Seth, and claimed he was extremely pretentious and aloof (which is true enough, but save the aloofness, also applicable to Mark himself). That very same night we hung out, he declared ferociously Fuck Seth! to which I amicably replied, Hah, been there, done that. He was visibly irked out, and said to me, Wow, Im sorry you have to live with yourself, after that. I didnt feel particularly insulted, but rather undermined and skeptical about this guys supposed caring, gentle, spirit. I just didnt see it.
