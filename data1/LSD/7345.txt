Physical exhaustion finally got the better of us and at around 00:00 we laid in bed, trying to sleep, while still light tripping. My boyfriend didn't have trouble falling asleep, I on the other hand turned to the help of xanax (1 pill) to help me relax. The next morning I realised I should've just been a little more patient with me and not take it, as I felt my head heavier than usual, a sensation not normally felt after a day of acid use, for me.
