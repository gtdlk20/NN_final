When we started walking back, we ran into my friends brother and their other friend. They both asked me if they could have some of my acid. I told them I could give them the number of the guy I got it from but that what I had was for me. I didnt want to deal with other people coming up on what Id just had. I just wanted a nice, clean comedown. They didnt seem to have the respect that I had for it. Not to be self-righteous, I just didnt want anything negative to happen to them on my account. I was ok with taking on their karma and them taking on mine, but their karma while tripping acid was something else entirely for the state I was in.
