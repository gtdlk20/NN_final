The reality fracture that I had that night is as real as anything I have ever experienced. I was forced to choose a direction, but didn't really know it at the time. In the end I chose a very unique path. All through the time that I was at the house and with the others I felt the strong presense of other higher beings. They spoke to me through the movements and words of those around me and through my thoughts. Occasionally, I would get a reoccuring thought that was usually a statement. 'If I don't go, nothing ever happens.' etc. It seems to me that I thought clearly throughout, but that the problems remained. I am not implying that the silly and incorrect thoughts I had that night were placed in my head, but that I was able to choose to think above them... Or not.
