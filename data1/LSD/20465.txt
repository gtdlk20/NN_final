I am just completely puzzled and eventually he begins full on laughing and chuckling while explaining how many people died and all this messed up stuff about the Holocaust and then sooner or later the audience starts laughing with him as hes explaining these depressing facts and me and my friend both just look at each other and are so confused. So fucking confused and creeped out. I remember just saying Thats not funny..why are they laughing at this? What is going on?
