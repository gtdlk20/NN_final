After about 30 minutes I think, my two non-tripping friends were getting really bored of babysitting and wanted to go out to eat.  They assured us that we were acting normal enough to not screw up, so Nick and I agreed that it would be ok since they left.  They told us that we could crank up the guitars and the music.  We started peaking right about the time they left.  I felt like I was sharing thoughts with Nick - if he said he was seeing or feeling something, I would almost always see or feel it too.  I don't remember a lot, but there are lots of separate parts I do remember.
