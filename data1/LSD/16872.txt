I said, 'Don't I get what?'  It suddenly felt like she was making fun of me... She tapped another party goer on the shoulder and whispered something to him and giggled.  I began to sense the presence of Evil at the party very strongly.  She then looked at me again and said 'You really don't get it, huh?'  Then another person stopped next to her and repeated the same thing.. 'Jay, you don't get it?'  I had the sudden need to be far away from this place... The question began to travel through the party... 'DON'T YOU GET IT?'  I could hear it as I walked back into the house following me, and no, at the time, I can honestly say that I didn't get it...
