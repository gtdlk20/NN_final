I give up looking for S.  We walk into the entrance closest to us and get ready to ride a ride.  I walk through the metal thing that turns and get in line.  Suddenly I realize how long this line is and how long we have to wait.  I feel like everyone in line is staring at me.  I freak out and without saying a word to C I push about 6 people out of my way and squeeze through the metal thing and continue walking.  I realize a few people had shouted at me and suddenly consider the thought that other people have feelings too.  Up until this point I had completely forgotten the concept of the human being except for C and S.
