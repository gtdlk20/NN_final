Although lsd usually takes an hour to come on strongly with me, I was beginning to get serious teeth chatter and body shaking within 15 minutes.  The tea made me have to piss, and when I stood up from the circle I tried to walk down the hall to the bathroom.  Already quite confused, I stumbled in the hallway and landed on B's bed (fortunately).  My friends were very concerned about the noise, but I assured them that I was OK as I burst into nervous laughter.
