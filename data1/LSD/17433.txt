I missed the cool night air as soon as I set foot in the cafe.  I shot a look at P. And he seemed a bit tense.  Ordering drinks was fascinating, above all in that I was acutely aware of all the undercurrents of feeling in the cashier and other customers in line.  I desperately wished their silly masks of civility, false confidence, and comfort would be abolished.  I walked with P. to the couch, hyper-sensitive to every sensory stimulus as newly shaven skin during sex.  We sat and talked for a while about the things we percieved from the place and its patrons.  People sat around us, pretending we didn't exist, and the jukebox started playing shitty 90's alternative - it all hit me like lemon juice in a cut. Of one mind, P. and I got up, and left.  we talked about how we'd never learned our lesson that city tripping sucks, and went to a park.
