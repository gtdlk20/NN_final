A few weeks ago my GF (well call her Summer) and I (well call me Valk) did our first trip on LSD, taking 150ug. Experience was amazing for us. Visuals, mental expansion, good conversations, everything we hoped for our first time but it left us a bit hungry to go higher, expand our minds further, to see *more*. So with that in mind we decided to drop 250ug in an incremental increase of what we did our first time. And oh boy. It was a ride. Not sure if the dosage was higher than we were told or if the effects going from 150ug and 250ug are just that much more pronounced but wow. Visuals everywhere of all kinds, some ego-death like experiences reminiscent of losing a sense of self and what reality is (your place in the world, where you begin and end, losing a sense of perspective in thought, thinking from a third person view and etc), thought loops, synesthesia, moments of overwhelming euphoria, love, tears, fear, and also some panic about safety and hurting oneself (not suicidal, but just thoughts of possible injury while tripping). Was an experience. Trip lasted in total, from taking the tabs to getting in bed trying to sleep, about 12-13 hours.
