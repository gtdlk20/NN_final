I had tried lsd once before with little effect other then intense laughter and apprehencation of music. I was pretty open to trying it once again with a higher dosage and my friend 'joe' felt the same way. So one day after waiting for a time to do it we decided to go camping at a beautiful lake. We had to do things like meet his gf and pick up the acid and by the time we were on our way it was 138 am. We wanted to go up to whistler first but when we got there the highway was closed so we sat on the side of the highway toking out of my bong when we decided to drop the acid.
