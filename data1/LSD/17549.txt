About a month later, some other friends of mine who get their acid from a completely different source asked me if I wanted to get some. They had gone on camping 'trips' numerous times and told me how much fun it was. I told them that last time i got acid that it was fake, and they reassured me that what they got was 'VERY REAL'.  So i bought 2 sugar cubes with one hit of acid dropped on each.  Since i had nothing to do after work on the sunday i bought them, i decided to trip when i got home from work.  I didnt have a sitter this time, and i was actually kind of skeptical becuase of the last time i got it. But they said it would work for sure.  I dropped one cube at about 10 PM.  I called a friend who talked to me till about 5 in the morning.  By 12 in the morning, nothing seemed to be happening (although my pupils were large), so i decided to wait a little while longer before i took the other one.
