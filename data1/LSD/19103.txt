My story begins on a late July evening. I had just finished a typical night of smoking some weed with my cousin (known as T) at a friend's house. When the session was over, they had explained the night prior everyone tripped and they had a couple tabs leftover. I had done LSD before with Ecstasy and totally fried my brain, but that was months ago.  I was pretty damn bored that night, with nothing planned after my cousin would drop me off. I bought the tab for cheap and my cousin and I were on our way.
