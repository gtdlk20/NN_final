My heart chakra has opened up even more than before, and I feel true love towards my ex-girlfriend [she doesnt want me back after I told her how I really feel =( ], my friends, and even my former enemies. Forgivness and light surround me today. I am also pleased that the LSD took over my thoughts, I find myself thinking a lot less today. I am just in the groove of existence without analyzing it so much.
