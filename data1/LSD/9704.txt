I shared an apartment with a girl that was on a long trip to India at the time so I allowed a friend, let's call him B, that didn't have a flat and obviously no intentions to get one, to live with me for a month. It really eased the life of my other friend, let's call him M, because B has accomodated himself at his place for a long while now. So when I came home, tired and looking forward to my bed, these two guys were sitting on the couch watching TV with a bottle of JÃ¤germeister and a few beers - obviously in a good mood. It was the winter of the glorious Hoffmann 2000 acid papers (if you remember those :-)) and these two guys where having a nice evening with each a half of one. M had bought himself a few sheets so he was always very well equipped and taking acid was at that time for M (my closest friend back then) & me a very common thing while B was more a Cocain-guy and experienced but not used to acid.
