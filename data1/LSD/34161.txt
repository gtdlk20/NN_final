I really don't think I was in the appropriate setting for this type of extensive interfacing but there I was.  In the Moment.  Past Present and Future lined up into one and created a lattice work of moving eternity so I jumped on.  I went through many synchronicities lining up people in my life events coming into place.  At one point in the reality I was in I Birthed universes for the future or past or the infinte.  Time has a funny way of bending and contorting in this altered state.
