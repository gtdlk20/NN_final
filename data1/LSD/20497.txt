I remember this is also the stage in which things got very introspective and reflective. Things also got very emotional again but in a deeper more introspective way I remember just having absolutely no ego or sense of self importance. I was so small even smaller than I was earlier and it felt kind of exotic and very deep. It felt almost avatar and otherworldly like with shrooms but not quite. It was definitely visible mysticism though. For some reason my minds eye visuals were so strong and visual as well but in my head. It was kind of an evocative experience and I started reflecting a lot and thinking about a lot of personal things and things about the world and people I know and just life. This egoless view of life and the whole world was very striking and cut pretty deep down. I remember almost getting kind of flashbacks and extremely vivid almost tactical memories to certain events and people I know. I randomly started thinking about things like the first time I snorted cocaine several months prior to this.
