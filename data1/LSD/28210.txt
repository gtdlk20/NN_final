I then began to trip by myself. I saw the wood grain on my roommates bed grow and change, then the ceiling would form these sort of rainbow images. I then began exploring my computer, realizing how much, much better some music is. Beatles, Pink Floyd, and other artists sound amazing. I closed my eyes and lied on my bed relaxing and feeling my body sort of melt away, where the only thing left was my existence, no materials just my thoughts and mind. I then went back to my computer, watching my background morph and icons move. I attempted to go online but failed, so I just went to Itunes visualizer, the visuals were amazing, it seemed as if it would seep into our reality and become the only thing I could see.
