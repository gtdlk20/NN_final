I think Wally began to get scared too and he started to call out for Jim too. I began to think that we would have to leave him in the tree foreverÂ… -Suddenly a cry of pain came out. Jim had jumped out of the tree thinking it was only a few feet but it was really a lot more than that. Thank God I thought, we can leave now.
