We played xbox for about an hour and then my friends started asking me about the acid. I was pretty stoned at the time so I told them I wasn't sure. A few guys told me that it should take about 45 minutes to hit me, so I became skeptical of the authenticity of the tab I took. We continued to play X-box for another hour until I started to realize that I wasn't just stoned. A poster on top of the TV looked slightly distorted but I couldn't point my finger on how exactly it was distorted. And then the people in the poster started look very real, like a window into another world. The poster did not become animated but I made note of this visual and told my friends I was beginning to feel something.
