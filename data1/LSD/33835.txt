I had planned on not leaving the apartment because I have some annoyingly nosey neighbors in my apartment complex which made me nervous, but I had to go outside to see what it looked like. It was a beautiful day, sunshiny with not a cloud in the sky. I saw my landlord J*** and decided to say hi to him (I was on the 3rd floor balcony and he was down in this little courtyard on the ground floor cleaning a barbeque grill) I said hello, but he didn't hear me. I kept saying hello but he still didn't hear me (he's an old guy) and for some reason I thought something might be wrong with him the way he was standing there so I thought I'd go down and talk to him to see if he was okay. There goes my plan of not leaving my apartment.
