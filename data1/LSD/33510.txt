I have my own weed and a very strong desire to have a good blunt available while at cedar point so I tell C to take the wheel and roll a very decent blunt that will hit good, stay tight, and even a nice little mouthpiece.  After we finish rolling the blunts we have a large open space to finish driving to ohio, about 40 minutes if I had to guess.  We have a bowl and marijuana but me and C agree that bowls will ruin the very nice blunt high we have going right now and decide not to smoke bowls until after the day is over.
