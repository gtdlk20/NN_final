Upon returning to my room, I made funny faces at myself in the mirror, something I do on a daily basis just for fun. On acid it's even more fun and I chuckle at my reflection, taking care to recognize the dilated pupils that Hofmann's potion had blessed me with. Focusing on my face and ignoring the rest of what the mirror shows me, my doppleganger suddenly popped out of the mirror and I am literally face-to-face with a 3D replica of myself. I found this especially entertaining.
