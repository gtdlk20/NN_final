After a long meditative cleansing of my mind and soul I felt rejuvenated, as if I had been reborn. I then received one of the greatest feelings in my lifeÂ… I had mentally destroyed my physical depression! The rest of the trip became extremely wonderful, I saw 'happy colors' everywhere, and I even started to geek out for about 15 minutes or so [not exactly sure how long, my concept of time was severely altered]. This made acid become my favorite drug of choice, not including marijuana. My friends told me about the dangers of bad trips and I believe that bad trips can be easily prevented if you have a strong mind/will.
