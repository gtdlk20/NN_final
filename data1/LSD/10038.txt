I began to feel that there was a 'mystery'.  When my old reality slowly creeped back, there was a fear.  I knew that I knew something, but what?  Where the hell is this place?  It seems familar, but how?  Being in India, on the other side of the world, made it even more surreal, because it clearly wasn't MY world or MY familiar territory.  The setting lent itself to me feeling that I had somehow (died? entered cosmic consciousness? gone insane?) sublimated into an alien place.
