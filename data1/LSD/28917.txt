We finally get tired of walking around in the tunnel and sit down in a spot and just talk and smoke. My friends are just tripping I could tell. I look at my friend D's face and his eyes looked empty like a body with no soul. And Rob was chill he was enjoying himself laughing talking with the group. We get tired of the light and wanted to sit in pitch black for the hell of it so we turned the light off. The OEV were strong things felt like they were flying past me in weird shapes.  Out the corner of my eye I saw a light coming from the glowstick but ignored it and that made my visuals spin start moving in all directions.
