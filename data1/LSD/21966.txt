The night prior to taking LSD, J had gotten very drunk and blacked out. While I was gone getting the second tabs for A and myself, J is having a wonderful time. He questions, why can't I feel like this all the time? to which A replies because it is illegal. Saying this triggered something in J and he began to feel as if he was in a coma because he drank too much alcohol the night before. He thought that we were figments of his imagination and that the police were trying to wake him up to bring him out of his coma. J went into our friends dorm and laid on the floor saying, either nothing is real or I am dying right now. After a couple of hours he realized that it was just the acid and was able to enjoy the rest of his trip.
