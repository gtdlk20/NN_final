As we walked through our small town, I felt like we owned the streets. Everything struck me so funny still, the way we walked through the town, kind of strutting down the sidewalk like we could do whatever we wanted.  Everything Aj and our other friend were saying was so funny to me and I kept laughing at everything.  I still have no recollection of what we talked about or why it was funny. It was inexplicably hilarious at the time though.  We were going to our friend B's house, but he was at the house where a bunch of theater kids lived, playing beer pong.  He invited us to come in and I said no, but he said everyone there would be cool with us tripping.  I agreed to come in when he said there was a hookah, I wanted to smoke.  We went inside and immediately I knew it wasn't the best situation.  I saw a bunch of people I knew who I didn't want to know I was doing drugs.  I tried to act as normal as I could and ignore that I was tripping.
