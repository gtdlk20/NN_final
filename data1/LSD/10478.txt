His roommate walks in the door.  I didn't know who he was and he asked if I was the guy who was going to eat acid with Nathan.  I had forgotten I ate it until that point but said that I was.  He said it was cool and asked how much I had eaten.  I remembered it was a square and told him 9 Timothy Leary heads.  He looked at me with shock or some sort of emotion that only a head full of acid could describe.  So the roommate grew into the floor and turned into an alien and started speaking in a language I didn't know, or didn't think I did.  However, when I really concentrated I knew what he was saying.
