I told Nikki and her date that they had to come and bond with Bill the trip Gnome. We went to our comfort zone which was untouched thanks to Bill. He had a little satisfied smile on his face, and just looked at us with his blue eyes. We all agreed he was special, and magical. We were all glad I decided to bring him to the party. Most of the people had left, and the others that were still there gave us a nice vibe and we were all very comfortable. I drank some beer and took some asprin and just relaxed the rest of the nite. I said my goodbyes and went home with my friends. That nite or should I say early morning, cause it was like 4am when i got home, well I sat Bill down on the table next to my bed and just stared at him until I fell asleep. He seemed to sooth my brain and sing me to sleep.
