Walking through the sand is now a very unpleasant feeling and suddenly I am seeing everything repeat itself in time.  I am watching myself do things that I have already done yet everything else continues on.  This worries me because I can't change my actions and everyone else can.  As suddenly as this wild feeling of deja vu kicked it, it suddenly left me as though it never happened.
