When we got there we went down to his basement quickly to avoid his parents. Of course as soon as we got down there what do we see but his mom. Thankfully so was drunk so she didn't bother us. We played ping pong for a couple of minutes and I gathered up enough nerve to go home and face my mom whom I thought would yell at me like no tomorrow.
