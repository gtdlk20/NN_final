T+8.00: I spent roughly the last two hours outdoors, wandering around the local nature reserve and beach. The journey started interestingly when as I turned on to the path leading to the nature reserve I overheard two women walking by, one of them was asking the other something along the lines of Do you ever wonder what people say about you in other peoples stories? Like, if you are a part of someone elses narrative?. Now that is a fairly deep snippet of conversation to be overhearing with a head full of acid.
