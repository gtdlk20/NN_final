If reality was truly based on perspective and perspective only, life had a point- everything around me was changing its shape based solely on what I was hearing.

And though they all were so different, they were the same. I had once again managed to sink to the floor, a fluid motion that felt like an elongated second. Once down, the floor became a cloud and the faces floated around me. I couldnt feel myself sitting, which was odd, because I knew I was.
