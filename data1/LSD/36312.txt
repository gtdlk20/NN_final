I took half a tab at 3pm, and then didnt feel anything so took another half, half hour later, and then again another half, half hour after that. By 5pm I was wasted, I couldnt see properly or stand up, I ended up falling into my bed and just closing my eyes, I cant remember anything that happened, only my mind was racing so fast, I couldnt sleep, I was tossing and turning, so hot and sweaty and uncomfortable, and then finally at 4am I started to feel a little normal again. I was meant to go to work this morning but I was a right mess after no sleep. I'm feeling ok now, 24 hours post drug injestion, but I was just wondering what other peoples experience was. Did I take too much, was the environment not good? I must say I never want to take it again! I have DMT and find that a much more powerful and healing experience.
