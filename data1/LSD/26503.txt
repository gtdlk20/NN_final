I wondered what it would be like if I stopped the tape. But when I did, I felt cold, like something was missing, and one of my companions said, 'Hey, I was enjoying that!' so I resumed the tape. We stood there, slowly walking around in this new world. One of my companions asked me a question: 'Are you there?' It was as simple as that. Was I there? 'Yes,' I replied. We were all in that other place, a new realm of experience. Shit, yes, I was there!
