 I had tried to take LSD many times but none had worked and I was beginning to get very frustrated.  Most were fake blotter tabs and one was a dilute vile which messed me up but still nothing that would constitute an LSD trip (from what I have heard and read).  I finally got a hold of what I think was the real thing at a Rusted Root concert in Albany.  I had decided on the way up to the show that I was going to try and find it there and began getting very excited for the night.  I was with 3 other friends W, T, and B.  W was our driver and decided to go sober for the night.
