My perceptions of reality have changed and expanded.  In my trip I felt no spiritual connection(proablly because I am an atheist), rather the enormity and infinitnes of the universe compared to my meager self.  I pondered the struggles of mankind, the futility of war, violence, and other hippy thoughts.  Over all it was probally the best trip I ever had, as I have had a few more since:).
