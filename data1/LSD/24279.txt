I was around 17 and my friend 'Wally' and I had planned an adventure unlike any other we had experienced before. Our friend 'Jim' had gotten the acid for us and would be joining us on the trip. I work at K-Mart and got off work at 4:30, Jim came to K-Mart as soon as I got off and from there we proceeded to Wally's house.
