We went out to eat after my friend was able to drive and sat at a restaurant listening to the loud but somehow pleasant noise of the busy street nearby. I was in a blissful state when a passing car threw a beer bottle that only missed my head by inches. It could have been a diaster! But like many of my experiences, it LUCKILY turned out differently. MAY ALL OF YOU FIND INNER-PEACE AND HAVE SUCH LUCK!
