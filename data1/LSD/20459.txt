What me and my tripping friend didnt realize at this point was that this trip would somehow continue to get even stranger. We werent prepared for any of this. The next thing that happened was baffling and it still baffles us to this day. We were flipping around channels on the T.V. surrounded by foreign patterned carpets in this living room and one of the first channels we arrive on is a real life show. As it was real people. I still have NO idea to this day what the hell kind of show this was but it was just this guy, some kind of guy sort of trying to be funny in front of this live studio audience while trying to tell them and inform them about something. And it wasnt like a scam thing or religious thing just pure entertainment and I could tell he wasnt the main runner of the show or the main host because he had this guest' kind of vibe. He was kinda funny looking in a way too, kind of looked like that singer from that song Rude by 'MAGIC! or whatever and he kind of looked distorted and underwater but not really. It just looked funny and dumb once again like on shrooms, and I remember the background behind him was very blue and vivid and all the colors on the screen were more vibrant. It was weird because reality and the real world looked so hyperreal, more real than usual meanwhile anything on the T.V. seemed extra fake and blurry but still colorful so it was very odd seeing high definition real life right next to shitty T.V. picture life only separated by the border of the screen. But the strangest part was what this fucking guy started to talk about and it confused the hell out of me and my tripping friend.
