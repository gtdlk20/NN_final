2-3 hours had passed since the digestion of the blotter piece and I felt a bit unsure about myself and started to meditate on everyday problems that came up to my mind. I light up my favourite incence and a candle and set it on the floor of my room and just sat down and started to think and I found a solution to everything I had a bad feeling about at that point and had no fear anymore and just thought that everything will go as it will go.
