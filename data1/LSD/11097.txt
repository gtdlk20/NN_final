I went to use the bathroom again, and once again entered a glass and tile funhouse. I stared at my face in the mirror and watched it morph for a while. Then, somehow, the image in the mirror became another 'me'. I realized I was looking at myself in the mirror from the perspective of everyone else. Normally, I think I must seem a bit odd to other people, but I realized that I am to everyone else as they are to me.
