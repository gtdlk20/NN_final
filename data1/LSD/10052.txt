I was seeking a spiritual experience, and I got one.  I wasn't ready for it.  I haven't tripped since then, 4 years later, because I feel no need.  I want to explore that area more, but I need to find a different approach.  The potential was there in that trip to have really hurt or possibly killed myself.  I'm still gathering bits and pieces of mental debris from that mind explosion.
