At around 4-5am I decided that I should climb into bed as my brother would be home anytime. I turned the PC off and climbed into bed. I now know NEVER to sit or lie down without music on or any other thing to distract me as I start thinking about negative things. As I was laying there in bed, I started thinking about my life, where I was going, what I was currently doing etc etc. I felt like shit, I realised that I should be taking education seriously as that should be the most important thing currently in my life. But I was failing in school, so I felt very depressed, I was failing in life. I just wanted to sleep, to escape these thoughts. But I couldn't sleep, not after only 8 hours of dropping the acid. I was getting really upset that I couldn't run or hide from myself, my own thoughts, my own state of mind.
