Saturday morning we woke up late and sat around reminiscing about how cool the concert was.  We all decided we would try to get tickets to the Saturday night show.  Then my friend D pulled out a little bottle and smiled at me.  He asked me if I wanted to do some acid.  It was a very interesting thought, I had never really considered it before.  I had only smoked pot about three times before this trip.  I asked everyone what it was like and about all I could gather from them was that it was 'crazy,' 'intense,' and that I would be a different person after.  I thought for about fifteen minutes and decided to go for it.  D put two drops from the little breath freshener bottle on my tounge.  I rubbed it around my mouth and swallowed.  'That's it?' I asked.  'Thats it,' D said.  The friend I drove down from St. George also took one hit.
