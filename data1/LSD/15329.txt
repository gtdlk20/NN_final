I probably did acid over 200 times in a space of about 3 years, at one point 3-4 times a week.  I dropped out of college twicein my 8th semester. Its impossible to say how much acid contributed to or was a result of other psychological problems/pressures. The spectre of VietNam, a break up with a girl that I took very hard and hanging out with a very Rock and Roll crowd didnt help Im sure! I wouldnt blame any of it on acid really, never having a bad trip and having a couple of other very memorable experiences (fraternity hazing and the release of Abbey Road come to mind!)
