When we reached the car he had snapped out of it completely when he saw his camera. Yeah it was bad. He attempted to turn it on and it just squeeled in agony from the broken components trying to move. We drove around a bit longer where for me the visuals were still very exotic and colorful. We discussed the previous nights events and both agreed to make our way back home for some sleep and food. I spent the next several hours awake around my house where I was still having very vivid hallucinations and a hard time getting the motivation to sleep. I finally slept around 4pm and made it out until about 9pm.
