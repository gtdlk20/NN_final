After a while we settled down a bit and ventured outside again only to jump back as we realised the sun was about to rise, we once again made the same journey we'd made earlier that night but this time it was nature the surrounded and hugged us. The wind raced by, everything around us, the trees, and the grass was a mass of intense lush green movement. We paused in the middle of the paddock to look deep into the grass and admire it incredible beauty and endlessness.
