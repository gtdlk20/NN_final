I took one 160ug tab and was waiting and smoking marijuana which caused my perception of time to be slightly off. I thought it had been awhile and I wasn't feeling the LSD at all yet, I just felt pretty stoned smoking bongs almost back to back. After about 20-40 minutes, I decided to take another tab (making the total acid taken around 320ug) and sit for awhile.
