My sitter and I took a bus into my city centre and milled around while I waited to come up, I started to feel off baseline after about an hour but my impatience was getting the better of me and after an hour and a half I dropped the second tab. A trip to the local art gallery was pretty strange, we only spent about fifteen minutes in there but by the end some of the more modern abstract art was beginning to take a decidedly trippy feel. One of the unexpected effects the acid gave me was that it made my ears pop really frequently, similarly to when they do as a passenger on a plane taking off or landing. Id earlier arranged to meet some friends at a jazz gig in a student bar, so me and my sitter headed to the station to wait for our bus.
