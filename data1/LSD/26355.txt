I'll cut to the chase.  My perceptual processes were simply not ready for the rush of everything that happened, and I spent a long period of time adjusting to it all.  Part of it was the acid.  Another major part of it was being out in unfamiliar territory and not feeling so sure of myself to begin with.  Then, there were all the people yelling, the rangers, and the fireworks.  I'm talking massive overload here.  My mind's reaction was to shut down some of the sensory input by turning off different senses.  I spent a brief period of time being blind and another one being deaf.  These both shortly came back to me, however, once I was in a lower-stimulation environment.
