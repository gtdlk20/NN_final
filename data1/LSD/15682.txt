T+1 hour: Starting to feel odd, just straight out weird. A bit anxious, I can feel it in my stomach and it's really annoying, we're giggling about everything mocking the cats in the house, I don't even know why, it was just funny. We start seeing some visuals, things turning and spiraling and patterns emerging and such, nothing brilliant but hey it was entertaining. The nausia is subsiding a bit. All of a sudden my friend whose house I was at comes into the house crying, and I think 'Oh shit, tell me this isn't just a perfectly cliche event to lead us onto a bad trip.' So I go into the other room and that's when the fear starts coming, because we just started coming up fairly strong when my friend came in and I'm like damnet, so I started thinking of like all these terrible things associated with evil and death and it was just scary, and I was on the verge of freeking out when my girlfriend came in and comforted me, saying how she was okay and my friend had made her hot chocolate. So I calmed down a bit, my friend left and it was us 2 again in the house.
