A couple of weeks ago, my fiance M and I were given two Necco candies with Lsd dropped on them.  We took it the night we got it, after a nice, mellow dinner party with close friends.  It was a very impulsive move; usually he and I make preparations such as location, purpose and general feelings about taking the drug.  But that night we just decided to take them right when we got home, as it was already midnight.
