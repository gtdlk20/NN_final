The first moment that I noticed I was tripping (my own personal test- if I look at a cigarette right out of the pack and it somehow looks kind of bent, I'm probably starting the trip) about 25 minutes after eating the paper.  Soon my skin began to tingle in a familiar way, and my mind began to branch out in its thought processes.  It was to be a very strange trip indeed.
