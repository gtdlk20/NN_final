To sum it up, I had never been so scared of anything before in my life and it was truly terrifying not being able to control my thoughts and not being able to stop myself fighting my mind, but I am glad I went through some of it. I didnt really understand how powerfull a mind really is and I really do have alot more respect for LSD now, I'm not sure why it didnt take any effects after some hours and I'm sure the weed did something to set the LSD off because it was instant....
