Before taking my second hit I look over to the Lake.  (Or ocean I'm not really sure what it was, it was a large body of water).  The water goes all the way out to the horizon and merges with the blue sky, and I notice how incredible the clouds are.  I inform my friends that the clouds are moving, and I am just astounded.  I start walking towards the horizon, not knowing what it is I want to accomplish, only knowing that I want to be as close to this amazing spectacle as I can.  Before I step into the lake completely clothed my friends drag me back.  I turn to C and say guess what.  I hit the blunt and suddenly he remembers that were smoking a blunt in public and his eyes get very wide and he holds out his hand to take his turn.
