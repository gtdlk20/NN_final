This was not quite my first LSD experience but it's one of my favorite ones to date. It was my 12th trip on LSD and the first report Im translating to English on purpose because it's one of the few experienced Id like to share with more then just the Dutch. It was mostly a very interesting experience visually. I found the visuals of this experience to be extremely typical for a medium to high dose of LSD which is why I assume it might be interesting to read especially for those less experienced and maybe recognisable for the more experienced psychonauts.
