4:30 begin to peak hard. Tracers are everywhere. No matter what I look at it is morphing and tracing into multiple objects. And the colors wow was this a colorful trip. I was feeling so amazed by this drug. I feel like the acid is massaging my body, I feel so comfortable. I texted my friend and wanted to go hangout with him since I was tripping hard all by myself. The road looked like a cartoon. The trees were swaying everywhere and since it was a rainy day the rain literally was red, green, purple, and pink.
