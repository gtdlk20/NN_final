The next four hours or so were spent having conversations on a long beachfront walk. I found out many things- that the universe makes no sense. That life is meaningless. That trees and people and animals and everything follow a unique fractal pattern. That peoples personalities and facades are empty. That life revolves entirely around the sun. That humans follow a much more basic primordial clock than wed like to admit. That math is an expression of innate characteristics of the universe. That the physical universe is the only universe. That our entire thought processes, actions, and lives are governed by physical properties.
