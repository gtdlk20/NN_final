For some reason we decided to leave the rather comfortable home, possibly because I got the feeling my face was being boiled on one side by the heater in there. Im not sure what we did up to that point but by now it was around midnight and the visuals were slowly but steadily building up. We decided to go for a little walk to the dike again. This time we found a cat that decided to follow us there. Maria found the cat a little annoying but I found it good company. When arriving on the dike we came to the conclusion it was very, very dark and we couldnt even see where we were walking. I was feeling quite up for the walk even though we couldnt see where we were going but Maria was a bit anxious about the darkness and the fact she couldnt see where shed put her feet. We decided to walk a bit further but once we got to a point where there's a row of trees Maria decided she didnt want to go on walking the round. I then suggested using glowsticks as torches but that was a very stupid idea, mostly due to the fact they were far too bright and blinding us, leading to the fact we saw even less of where we were heading.
