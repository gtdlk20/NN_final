I have done many many drugs, but lsd has been my favorite so far. This is because I love ethogens, and how they make your mind work.This is what happened to me after I took lsd, how it changed me. I took 3 hits of acid, put it under my tongue, waited, took an hour and a half to kick in, but when it did, everything was alive and talking to me.  Skeletons grew out of my basement floor and we hungout for 6 hours while listened to the grateful dead. But my favorite thing about it was, I could feel love flowing through my veins, for the first time I understood the beatles. Of course, all you need is love! Since that break through, I havent been angry, I've been frustrated, I've been irritated, but not angry. Life is way better now, I used to constantly ask people about what they thought of 2012, and the end of the world, now.. Doesnt bother me. So thats my conclusion, lsd has opened my eyes, made me a new person.
