All things fell apart in the line. We tried to keep a straight face, but I honestly believe that was impossible for us in the state that we were in. As soon as it was our turn to pay we started laughing very loudly. The lady at the cash register gave us a look like she was going to kill us. (She was very pissed off.) We somehow got out of the store and into my car. We ate the apples in my car in the parking lot. We sat there for at least 10 minutes, it must have looked very strange.
