I then went inside to take some bong hits and then drove home. When I got home, I couldnt sleep at all that night. I was so anxious and begining to feel extremely depressed and thought I was loosing my mind. For the next few days I experienced intense anxiety constantly. Prior to this experience, I had never experienced anything close to this level of anxiety. I experienced a vivid flashback several weeks later where I felt like I was tripping again. The intense part lasted only a few minutes but I had a detached kind of feeling for aboout an hour.
