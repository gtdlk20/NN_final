One last funny moment was when we passed the flower bush again.  Entheogen was picking some to paint and I was telling her what I'd felt before.  She kept feeling them trying to feel it with no luck.  I saw man mowing his lawn.  I told her we should go.  She thought I was being dumb, then I uttered the line that would become a classic: '[Entheogen], we are sitting here FEELING FLOWERS!  It may not seem weird to you, but trust me, it's weird.'  From there on out it was mostly these funny typse of moments as I was coming down.
