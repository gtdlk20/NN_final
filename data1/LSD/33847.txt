Eventually, my parents did come home and I felt better about that and I just sat on the couch watching TV like a cosmic retard, trying not to look like I was on drugs, just being low key and quiet. Eventually, they both left to go do some other stuff and I was alone again, but by then I was feeling a bit more 'normal'. I was trying to remember all the stuff I was thinking about just hours before. I felt like I'd lived a whole lifetime in one afternoon. I felt energized. Shakti/Chi/Energy was coursing through my body. Moving around was effortless. I felt like I was floating. My pupils were huge and I went outside and looked at the sun going down and the moon becoming visible. My mind roared silently. Libra moon. Glorious.
