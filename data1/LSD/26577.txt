my friend kirk, who was very silly at this point, had caught himself up in the blinds on the window, and swore he was being attacked by an octopus. i vigorously tried to save him with an umbrella, and we pretended to be on a hollywood high-seas adventure, playing around like a bunch of children. it was lots of fun.
