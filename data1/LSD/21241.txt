Music sounds superb. It's like something muffling the muic when you're sober has been peeled away. Music is cleaer sounding, more fluid. Listen to Royksopp, Air, Orbital and FSOL, my favourite music for tripping. Light on people's faces is different. Strong closed eye visuals -  a carnival of light. Mad creative thoughts. My emotional strings were never plucked like with shrooms once. I am happy throughout and never feel depressed.
