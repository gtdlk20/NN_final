We got back, and decided to walk the trails with three other friends. When we started to walk I became much happier, and the visuals were unbeliveable. After what seemed to be and hour or two of intense laughter and distortions we arrived back at the site. I then walked down to this swampy pond to listen to the echos of these bullfrogs calling with another person. I think it is there that I totally lost contact with reallity.
