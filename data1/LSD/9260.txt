My partner feels the fear go through me, my body becoming rigid. There is a scared look in my eye. I try my best to explain what I am experiencing and downloading. Having indulged in fear, I am now shut out of the experience. There are no more cosmic downloads or past life regressions after this point in the trip. When my mind recoiled from what I was seeing, in shock and horror, meant that I had seen all I was ready to accept tonight. All I can do is accept these kind of experiences at face value. I dont have to believe that what I saw was true or real, but I have to at least accept that I had the experience. Ive tried denying experiences before, and it was very distressful. The monkey mind does not like having the rug pulled from under its feet.
