I had arrived significantly early on purpose to allow for it to kick in properly while racing. I didnt want to be peaking (as far as one peaks on a lower dose such as this) during the hardest slog between mile two and three but I also didnt want to finish the 5K before the acid had kicked in either. Half an hour later the first of my coworkers arrives - Im wearing shades but its June and sunny as hell. He was around in the early 70s and would probably get great satisfaction out of knowing I rolled in with his old pal Lucy but he is, after all, my coworker - I hold my tongue. We people watch for a while, Im still feeling baseline but in an excellent mood. Another friend/coworker arrives - shes slightly younger than me but generally aware of my extra-curricular activities. Despite not knowing about todays enhancements, I still feel better knowing theres a fellow psychonaut around - just in case.
