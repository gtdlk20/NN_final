It tasted strange but I was so enthralled with the surroundings that were consuming me, that I didn't really notice.  The sky was a kaleidoscopic display of stars coupling with the sunset.  It was the perfect natural ballet.  The grass was growing very tall in the very back of his yard and they seemed to be carassing the sun that had almost left the sky.  The grass grew into distant trees and I started hearing the colors, especially the greens.  They were whispering peaceful thoughts about nature.  The leaves on one tree started laughing so I asked it what it was laughing at, telepathically, and they said that the stars were fucking.  I smiled and told them to hold on.  I looked at the stars and saw them with an unknown clarity.  The sun waned further down.  Only a stark blue tinge was left.  I laid down with Nathan crown to crown and we watched the stars produce more stars.  I could command them with my thoughts.  I asked their permission to see constellations.  They bowed and whatever constellation I wanted to see, they gave way.
