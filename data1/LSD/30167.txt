My roommate and I drove half an hour to another friend's house to procure seven hits of LSD. He got two, I snagged five. We picked up yet another friend and headed back toward campus. The remnants of a recent, particularly strong hurricane were just beginning to pass over our city, and the weather was a total mess. I dropped the first hit as we were leaving the house, and tasted that familiar taste...acid. I had a good feeling going into this trip, like it would be an earthshattering experience.
