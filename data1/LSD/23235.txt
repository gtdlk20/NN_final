Prior to the time I took LSD I was strongly anti-drugs. This was no doubt because of all the people around me telling me that all drugs were bad. Of course I believed them and whenever Id hear someone around me doing drugs, I would truely be disgusted. I then found out one of my close friends was doing a few drugs. I knew he was a cool guy so I let him explain to me what he had to say, which is when he started telling me about this drug called 'LSD'. He assured me that it was one of the safest drugs known to man in terms of adverse damage to the body. He then told me that the amount of LSD required to make you trip was less toxic than Vitamin C in an Orange, I was listening. These are the things that Im not told by the people who tell me all drugs are 'bad'. I then went on the web and read hours and hours worth of info regarding LSD. At this point I had realised that LSD was not in fact a 'bad' drug and I knew I was stable enough not to worry about psychosis.
