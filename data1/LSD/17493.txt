First, a few thoughts on psychedelic drugs in general - I believe that everyone needs to experience a reality that is otherwise completely alien to the individual. There is absolutely no way to imagine the effects psychedelic drugs have on the brain without living through it. If we can exist in a completely different dimension for a few hours, we can objectively view 'normal' reality for the first time. It is freedom from the mundane, and it is a world where money, government, oppression, and all the pervasive aspects of the world can dissolve into the background completely and honestly.
