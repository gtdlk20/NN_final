Ill refer to myself as Len. Im an international student who has recently moved to New York City to attend college. I dont want to disclose too much, but Ill tell you I used to live in Europe. Im currently studying Communications, though for some time I have wanted to switch to Music Business. I am not very happy with my living arrangement within the University - I live with 11 other girls in a loft, which is always dirty, as they dont clean up after themselves. I feel disconnected with them, and I am not too comfortable in that environment.
