After that was over we went for a walk.  Me and three others split off from the huge group and went our old middle school.  We sat for there and just tripped face for about an hour, then we decided to go back to the house.  We came to a hill that led down to the road, but we were all afraid to go down.  I decided it would be best to get it over with and jumped in.  I quickly jumped right back out because I thought the tall grass was stabbing me all over.  We found a path down, and we walked the sidewalk back to the house, and on the way, me and my one friend dodged across the street right in front of a cop, but for some reason, he didnÂ’t say anything.
