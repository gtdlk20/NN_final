A week ago I had mistaken a caffeine pill for Foxy and actually sold a few hits of it, and did some of it myself. Due to our habit of being stoned all the time, the placebo effect actually had me fooled for a while. I didn't want tonight to be a repeat of my gullibility so I was determined to be as skeptical about it as possible until I totally tripped out.
