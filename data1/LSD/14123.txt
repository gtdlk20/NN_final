I may never touch this substance again.  Many ancient cultures had one-time initiation rituals into their tribal religions, often as a rite of passage.  To me, this has been similar, to say nothing of the risks of what could have been.  But if things ever get as bad for me psychologically as they had been before this trip and I am seriously contemplating suicide again, years or decades from now, then perhaps I may consider it.  I had gone into this with the attitude of 'what do I have to lose?' and come away with the conclusion that life is amazing and wonderful even in its absurdity, that most of my issues were internal and solvable, that suffering is fundamentally dictated by one's perspective on impermanence, and that society and culture themselves are incredibly subjective and malleable.  I understand why psychiatrists experimented with this substance in therapeutic settings in the past.  But as with everything, the outcomes can be rather unpredictable.  My life and perspective as they had existed needed a shot of chaos, a perturbation in the path of the optimizer before it converged to a singularity-- and I am back in pursuit of my course through life now.
