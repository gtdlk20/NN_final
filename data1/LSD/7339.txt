The more acute effects hit us simultaneously. Time at moments felt to slow down, music felt pulsing through my body, making me move in a very senseless, deliberate way. I started seeing very distinct hexagonal patterns. At some point, my boyfriend asked me if I felt euphoric, as in if the drug made me feel better and I clearly remember answering that the drug didn't really pushed me into happiness, in a way some stimulants or other psychedelics do. On the contrary, it seemed to enhance what I was already feeling, it expanded on what I was already thinking. It didn't abolish negative thinking, I just had to focus on the bright side or I had to reason my way out of them. I was very in touch with my self, my boyfriend and the world around me, I was more connected to everything than ever. It was easier to see the funny side of many concepts, even death, which I regularly struggle to deal with. It felt so easy to laugh, in fact we were smiling all the way throughout the trip, which is remarkable. I cried so much during this too, out of pure bliss, a state of being that not even the purest MDMA had ever provided. We also teared up because of the extreme pupil dilation.
