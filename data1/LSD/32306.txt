Obviously there are a million things to be said right now but what I want to talk about it the effects of yoga after having tripped pretty hard for about an hour (which included a bus ride home) I came home.  My mom is a yoga teacher and my basement is half childs playroom half yoga studio.  I asked her if we could do some yoga, I blamed it on being stiff and tight but I soon learned that muscle and your body are all finite ideas.  Anyways we go down to the studio.  All of the lights are off except for the mood lighting.  There was chill music.  What really hit me about the yoga was feeling inside my own body.  All that bullshit yoga teachers always say stuff like 'pinch your shoulderblades back and feel your spine melting' I actually feel it and the ways that the yoga teacher describe things to me make perfect sense.  Things that dont make sense to me normally like 'lengthen your spine' make sense and I can feel it.
