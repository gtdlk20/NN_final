We got to our desired T stop at 8:30 and that left us half an hour to kill. We wandered around with no particular direction, half strung out and half still tripping. Now, Boston is not a town for psychedelic drugs by any means, but I've survived peaking in Boston so there wasn't much in the town that could throw me off, or so I thought, but instead, out of the blue, two people offered to sell Tom and me two different drugs (one was e, and the other was called 'charley,' which I think is heroin but I can't be too sure). That got me extremely paranoid and anxious about going to this club, because i have spent a lot of my life in Boston and I find it incredibly hard to find anything around here. Odd.
