I saw something about Snow White the other day and it got me to thinking about my first acid trip. I was 16, and had recently just begun my venture into the world of drugs. Of course it all started with that horrible 'gateway' drug, marijuana. I always scoff any time I hear someone say that, but that's pretty much how it went down for me. I'd been smoking the dope for awhile and was ready to try something new.
