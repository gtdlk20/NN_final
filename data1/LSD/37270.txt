I woke up exactly 3 hours after I took the dose.  It was 5:30 a.m. and I realized I was tripping!  Then I remembered the kid saying something repeatedly through the night...It was that the acid took 3 hours to kick in.  I walked around the house for a while and saw some crazy things.  I also watched a movie until my cousin came into the room and said she was going to work.  Then she looked at me and asked, 'why the hell are you awake?'  I told her my crazy drunken story and she said come outside we'll smoke a cig.  We did and squirrels were everywhere.  They kind of scared me a little, but they were friendly it seemed.  Then I was looking at the trees and they seemed to be smiling at me.  It was pretty wild.
