But back to what I missed, as soon as I turned around, I noticed Dianna had written Fuck Misogyny on Summers tiny calve. I laughed very loudly, which prompted them to laugh more with me. Dianna then realized she wanted more paint!, and went to change into shorts. I started to feel a sense of extreme euphoria: I wanted to laugh, I wanted to paint, and I wanted to feel everyone around me on a deeper level. It was a strange sensation - something I thought as more akin to MDMA (which I havent tried, but am intending to soon).
