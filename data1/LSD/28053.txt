Having done my share of LSD, I spose I should add my two bits to the heap. I have had over half a dozen sessions with acid, ranging over about 5 years. I have ingested roughly 10 blotter hits in this time. The last time I dropped was Dec 15 (or friday, whichever the date was), and second last was Dec 30 1987. Most recently, I started with 1 blotter at 7:39 am, took a second at 8:45, and a third at 4:00 pm. By 9:00 am the liquid skin disease had kicked in, and the metallic sweats came and there were indications of activity. By 10am mental activities were real white-waterish, if ya know what I mean. It was very pleasant. By noon I was really riding high. After the 4:00 booster, the effect was even more profound. By this time I had taken just below 3 blotter units. Acid insights galore, along with the laughter caused by profoundly realized revelations and humorous social-cultural reflections. Asleep by 3am, my girlfriend and I had a delightful, close, 'bonding' evening such as the effects were so wonderful.
