We made our way to my living room and chilled there for a little while. My favorite cat curled herself up to me and I was amazed by her tiny little body and her beautiful, intricate white fur. We talked for some time here, though most of my sentences were never complete because I was either interrupted by my friend C who was beginning to feel his high and he was talking very much, or my mind was interrupted by a whole other thought. This or I just couldn't find it in me to care to finish the sentence. It wasn't worth trying to explain most of the time, I couldn't articulate much of anything. A recurring motif in this trip, however, was my desire for a peanut butter sandwich because of my illness. My boyfriend made me the sandwich and we spoke in a British accent about my breathing sandwich.
