At 10 PM my younger brother who is 15 came home. He knows about my drug use and I immediately told him as he came through the door that I was tripping on acid along with A. I also told him we were probably screwed because mom and dad would be home relatively soon and I was still feeling it, though it had diminished a little. He told me I didn't have to worry, I didn't look like I was tripping on acid, and gave me probably the best part of the trip: magnets. 15 little round magnets captured my attention for the rest of the trip. I swore I could see their magnetic field. My boyfriend and I played with them and giggled incessantly while my friend C tried and tried to talk to us and hold a conversation, but I was hardly interested. I mostly wanted, at this point, to relax my mind and space out for a while.
