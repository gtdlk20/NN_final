We also saw kaleidoscopes for the first time and that was a new experience for both of us. Something we had never experienced on shrooms before just like time repeating itself. Just something new that shrooms hadnt shown us yet. The kaleidoscopes and time loops were a first. By the way I dont mean we saw colorful kaleidoscopic patterns or anything like that I mean solid objects would actually turn into real kaleidoscopes and we would see multiple copies of things right next to each other. It was like everything opened up but multiplied. These were multifaceted visuals that were hard to wrap your head around. I remember seeing a bougainvillea turn into a full kaleidoscope at one point in the light that was somehow shining from somewhere and those flowers have never looked the same for me. This is before we knew what kaleidoscopes actually were and I remember my friend mumbling trying to explain it and since I was seeing it too I was able to understand him and see what he was trying to describe.
