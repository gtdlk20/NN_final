It was dark when we got back to Douglas' room.  At this point I was no longer feeling any of the effects of the drug from before.  Instead I began to feel some after-effects, most notably including an excruciating vasoconstriction in my legs which is probably one of the most uncomfortable things I have ever felt in my life.  I was also feeling very 'out of it' and disconnected from everyone else.  When I got back to my dorm, my roommate was there with some of the people from my building.  They talked while I stayed mostly silent.  I felt so different from them, so much not a part of what they were doing and talking about and their activities.  It was profound.  That night, it took me a long time to fall asleep.
