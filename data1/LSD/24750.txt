At approximately 9:00 PM I injested 3 microdots. I had taken two of the same distribution on a previous night. Call it the magical wheel of dosage, I chose to take three. :) Me and a friend who was not on anything at the time travelled over to a friends house and I parked and locked up my car, putting a note on my steering wheel reminding me not to drive until 5AM the next day. I have never had to read this type of note to avoid doing something stupid, but I write them to make myself feel better.
