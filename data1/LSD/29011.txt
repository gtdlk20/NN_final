The peak washed over me in waves, time had no meaning. The beautiful carpet patterns changed to a dark fearful pit. Paranoid I lost all sense of comfort. As the walls flashed thru colors at a maddening speed the room grew darker. My heart raced, my stomach tightened into a knot. I knew I was dying. The music faded away and seemed very distant. Visions of my life flashed thru my mind. The couch seemed hot and sticky, and I couldn't move. It seemed like hours and hours I was numb and confused. I stared at the wall unable to move, visuals of all shapes seemed to suffocate me.
