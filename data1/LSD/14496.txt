I did it! I had survived the most chaotic scene I had ever witnessed in my life. I was not prepared, however for the change of scenery in the kitchen. The music had been turned off and everyone was diligently working. Everyone was assisting everyone do everything. I had never seen so much order and perfect work structure before. It was too strange so I closed my eyes and shook my head, hoping to erase the scene like an Etch-A-Sketch. Sure enough it worked. The scene now was kind of familiar. I knew I had been a part of it before, but it was still new. Then I figured it out, I had seen this in a dream before! Not only had I dreamt it before but it was a recurring dream. And not only was it a recurring dream but it was the subconscious vision I would picture every time somebody said the word pizza. It was the typical pizza place. Everybody seemed to be on roller skates. Im not sure if its because of how they were walking or because of the queer scenery I was imagining.
