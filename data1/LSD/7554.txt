At some point  not exactly sure where in the chronology of things  we were in my dorm room and my friends came in, like I had said.  I'm not sure if this happened only one time or if it happened a few times, I think probably the latter.  The highlight of this part of the experience was when I had gotten an inspirational burst of thought, just like the one I had outside of the bench  which makes me think this might have happened after that experience.  But regardless, I had this sudden and powerful thought ('insight' is probably the better word) about how the world is made.  I conceived of everything as part of a great spectrum, between two extremes, of absolute perfection and absolute imperfection.  Absolute perfection, I realized seamlessly and without manual reflection, is God.  And absolute imperfection represents the no-essence, having no energy, no character, no qualities, no mass, nothing.  And all life, I felt, was engaged in a constant struggle to move toward perfection  everything, all the time, is moving toward a state of perfection.  And perfection is so much a part of our 'quest' as humans that it defines what we are all about, and all the things we paint, and build, and write, are attempts to capture perfection that we discover in the world around us.  Nobody paints an ugly mountain, I think I might have said literally.  They paint beautiful mountains, the ones that speak to us because of their perfect quality.  And it just made so much effortless sense to me.
