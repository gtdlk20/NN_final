On the way back to the rest of the people, we took the train tracks.  As I walked along, I started to hear the increasingly obnoxious crunching of my feet on the coal, only when I looked down, I saw piles of brightly colored glass.  I didn't want to get a flat tire, so I picked up my bike.  We got to the end of the tracks and we had to climb down a small hill.  I got to the edge and slipped.  I started to slide down on the glass, but once I reached the end, I was fine,  I never even fell.
