I am a very bored person, if that makes sense to anyone. I used to always look for ways to amuse myself, including drugs and alcohol. I had just gotten involved with this guy, he was a raver and he had done ecstasy a few times. I saw this as a chance to try a new drug. After a long talk about what it was like, he took me with him to a rave. This was my first. I was very nervous at the rave, it being something completely new to me. I immediately sat down and started smoking. My boyfriend asked me for my money, and I gave it to him knowing what it was for. He told me he was going to go dance a little bit and then try and get us some pills.
