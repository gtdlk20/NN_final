Three years ago, I had experienced 'E' more than ten times and felt that the effects were becoming weaker and weaker.  Mind you, those ten times had been very close together, and I had lost interest.  A couple of weeks ago, my sister and I (who live 2,000 miles away from each other) had the opportunity to experience the chemical together and we jumped at the chance.  None of the 'old magic' had been lost.
