C, the guy I had met, introduced me to his friends, all of whom were rolling also. There was something so incredibly beautiful about sharing in the experience with all of them. There was something so incredibly beautiful about sharing in the experience with all of them. We were all smiling wildly and I knew I loved them also, loved the whole wide world. I also knew they could feel it too, and I rejoiced that they were as happy as I was. I was also really enjoying their company, though I had the urge to stretch and meditate and was generally introverted at this point in my life. I ended up just stretching anyways, and touched me toes effortlessly, holding them for what felt like 5 minutes. This is normally pretty difficult for me and causes pain, but at this point it felt amazing. C asked me if I wanted to go rollerskating with him and I decided it would be fun, although I had never done it before. I got my skates and decided to massage my feet before I put them on. I guess I was holding up my new friends, so they offered to massage my feet for me. I ended up with a guy massaging each of my feet, and it was the best-feeling massage of my life. H and D came up to us after awhile, they informed us that they had finished skating and we had been sitting on the floor for an hour. I couldnÂ’t believe it, it had only felt like 15 minutes max.
