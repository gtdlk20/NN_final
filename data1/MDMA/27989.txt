I was downstairs in the basement with a few friends just chilling for a bit. There was loud techno music going on, and for some reason, I kept trying to go to sleep. Everytime I tried sleeping, I would see these incredibly scary visuals. One of them involved Miss Piggy's face being blown out by a gun to her head. There was blood drooling from her mouth, and eyes wide open. These visuals got so random that I couldn't even close my eyes and stayed awake until I went home at 11 in the morning.
