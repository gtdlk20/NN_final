Anyways, everyone was sitting outside, idly smoking and sharing stories/trying to piece together what had happened the night before. To give some brief background, my friend G is an experienced MDMA user and always sings its praises.  He was telling me about how my other friend B had tried to score some Molly (that is, pure MDMA) from him last night but he didnt want to wake his dealer.
