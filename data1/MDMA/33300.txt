2:30am - I was stopped by C.  He was leaving and wanted to know If I wanted to be blown up one more time before he left.  Of course I agreed.  He told me to stand in front of the couch.  He now took a white flower oil soaked wash cloth.  I took one big inhale, he told me to hold it, he picked me up and wraped both arms around the bottom of my back, and rolled his intwined fists up my spine, cracking every bone in my back.  Away I went, into my place, almost as hard as before.  I awhile, chris was gone, and I spotted my glow sticks.
