1:55 AM - I felt an intensely striking sense of passion, clear connection, and pure appreciation for the natural state of the environment. I felt so deeply joyful and gracious to be experiencing the cool embrace of the night air, and gazing up into the cosmic darkness surrounding me. This wonderful euphoric peak lasted about another hour and a half before the gentle comedown period set in. I fell asleep peacefully around 4:00 AM.
