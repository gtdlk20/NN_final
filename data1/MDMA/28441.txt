T+260min   -  around  9-10ish, and it seems that it has worn off for the most part, I'm very happy and cant stop thinking about my experience, but my mood seems to be enhanced.  The comedown was VERY smooth , so smooth, I didnt really even feel like I came down until the next morning. Speaking of which, the next morning I felt great! Not shitty, like my friend told me.  I was happy to be alive, and had a knewfound  insight to the world and its various beautiful chemicals that were put here to give us an escape to reality, and explore our mind. I think we all need that sometimes.
