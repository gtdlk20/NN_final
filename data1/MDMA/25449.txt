E. Ecstacy.  You hear about it used in reference to clubbing or raving, and the reason behind this is because really, if you are thinking about rolling, or have done so only at your house, you need to roll n' rave. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and am taking cylert (a CNA stimulant) regularly.  I am not really an introverted person, rather I perceive myself as one of those intellectuals, that feels that they are better than everyone.
