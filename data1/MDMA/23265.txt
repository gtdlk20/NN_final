I was kinda upset because I realized that I probably wasted my money on a bunch of weak pills. I knew they were real because I was rolling very nicely from 2 of the same pills a few days prior, and I was getting some onset effects from the 1 pill, but how am I going to give them to my friends for the price I paid for them if I know they will need 2 to get the desired effects? Looks like I got screwed on this one. I feel incredibly ignorant for buying 20 pills withoug even considering that it took 2 pills the first time to get the effects I wanted.
