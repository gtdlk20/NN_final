The first feeling I get is a kind of jittery, unemotional soulful beat that pounds from the tips of my toes to the top of my head. I generally can be caught staring upward to the strobe light. My friend C equates coming on with a skinniness in her hands especially, skinny fingers is a fair sign that were in for a good roll. This night it took about 40 minutes to come on, and it came on strong. First thing I needed to do was move, and keep moving. Left, right, jump up, crouch down, two step, one step, pause, begin again. Its rhythmic, the essence of the music rolls over me, through my heart which beats in time, and to put it crassly I feel beautiful. More beautiful then I could ever normally feel. Like everything about me is perfect. My mouth is dry but I still talk about how good I feel. About how good the lighting is. I close my eyes, and my other senses take over. The way my shirt feels on my skin soft and flowing. The way the sweat and smoke and people smell sweet and damp, the way the chewy in my mouth is cold. Dance. Dance with strangers, dance with friends. Stand alone in the middle of the dance floor, completely still and marvel in the beauty, in the very creation of the people there.
