Im a gardener at heart and by nature (no pun intended). I walked over to the florist section. We were both awestruck by the colors and smells and the /purity/ of the scene. We went from flower to flower, smelling and touching and just bursting with happiness and just incredible good feelings. Im growing gladiolas and some red morning glories and other plants. it felt so good to see other plants that were babied as much as mine. We were just completely taken by it.
