The next day, as we were setting out for a hike, G told us that he was going to bring his E with him, because he felt that it would be a better experience to drop out in nature, near the water, and somewhere besides our campsite.  At this point, I had rethought my hesitancy from the night before, and decided that I was going to join him while I had this opportunity.  Things all fell into place and next thing I knew, everyone was wanting to drop.  We packed up ALOT of water, some candy we had lying around and some pacifiers(for the hardcore jawclenchers)and went off on our hike.
