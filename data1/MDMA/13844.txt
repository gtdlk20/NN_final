Im not rolling though.  Perhaps Ive gone past that.  I really dont feel stimulated at all actually.  My eyes are wide open, I can feel that: there is no need to check a mirror to know my pupils are extremely dilated.  Even so, I feel more like curling up and relaxing with a vinyl playing than I do dancing or partying.
