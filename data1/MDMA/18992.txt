Jen told me that she just never thought that James had wanted her.  James being a secretive and shy guy had even told Sarah when she had asked him at one point, that he didn't like jen.  I turned to Jen and said to her 'You really should bring this up' she said that she was scared and didn't want to risk it.  I then told her that she 'REALLY should bring this up because while I can't say waht I want to say becuase it wouldn't be what a good friend does, I happen to KNOW that it is a sure thing if you bring it up.'  The two of them got together and now are still together.  Everyone who knows the two of them thinks that they are THE perfect couple.
