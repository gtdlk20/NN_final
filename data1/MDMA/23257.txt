After I had peaked I got into a conversation with my friend about a lot of different issues in our lives. I felt very open to talk about anything with him. We stayed up the entire night talking. At about 8PM I left for work while my friend tryed to fall asleep. As a result, I was extremely tired since I didn't sleep and because of obvious reasons from rolling. After I at lunch at around 1PM I was feeling like I had some of my energy back, but I was still a little drained from not sleeping.
