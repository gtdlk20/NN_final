My history with drugs is slightly dense, and confuses me sometimes, but this is something I should talk about in relation to the effects of *real* MDMA. I started smoking pot and trying out pharmecutical stimulants before my first year of high school. I became interested in trying many new things, but never had the access to any of them. Eventually, throughout my high school career, I ended up trying speed, oxycodone and hydrocodone, methadone, salvia, DXM, Mushrooms, meperidine and hydromorphone, valium, morphine, cocaine, alprazolam, various muscle relaxants, peyote, and finally MDMA, almost in that order. My realest and truest experiences with psychoactives started once I ended high school, now able to control where I was and how much I wanted to do (aided by the money from my then-new job). Nothing rivals the feeling I got from real MDMA, and is something I can't even explain well to this day. The effects come up, and then they taper off, making one think that the drug's effects are done. Then they come right back up again, and this action is repeated several times, while the effects increase each time it comes up until I finally peak (which happens around 1 - 3 hours after taking it). This is what 'rolling' is. I had heard my friends talking about rolling, and the term meant nothing to me. It really is 'rolling' and I understand that now.
