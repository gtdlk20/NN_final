   As interesting as my high was, the comedown was shit, just utter shit.  Not like after a night on X.  My pupils were dilated, sometimes painfully, until I woke up Sunday morning (I dropped on Fri.)  I didn't even sleep until 5AM Saturday night, even then I had to force myself.  I spent all Saturday in bed, dizzy, sick, headache, everything.  I knew I was hungry and thirsty, but I couldn't hold anything down.  I tried to sleep it off but my eyelids refused to stay shut.  M___ felt the same, so did everyone I've talked to since who tried the same stuff.
