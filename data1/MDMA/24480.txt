As we walked back to our campground, we all walked, hand in hand, holding each other, each encouraging the other to drink, and to have a lollipop to make sure their jaw wouldn't hurt the next day.  We all cared for each other and watched out for each other.  As we got back to our campground, we were all content just sitting down on the cold ground in a circle and spilling our emotions.  I don't think I have ever talked this deeply with my friends in my life.  We talked about relationships with lovers, with each other, past relationships, feelings about our futures, feelings about family problems...everything!  It was such a feeling of relief to finally talk to people about things going on in my head that concerned me, and have them smile at me, and accept them as part of me....then lean over and give me a hug, or drop some lotion on my hands and begin to knead them tenderly.  It was an awesome feeling.  After the campfire was started up, it began to produce shadows that flickered off of the person next to us, and the trailers it was producing, especially when looking through our holographic glasses made me feel so aware of everything that was going around me....the shadows, the sound of the crickets, the sound of wood snapping under someone's foot.  I have never felt this emotionally attached to any group of people or any place as I did that night.
