Right before we entered the club, I took my first pill. After about an hour, I was dissapointed. I felt nothing. I ran outside to my car and downed the second pill. As soon as I finished swallowing the second pill, the first pill over took me like a huge wave. The street lights were enormous with huge rainbow halos surrounding them. I started laughing. I went back inside and my friends looked frightened by my appearance. They kept asking me if I was okay. I just laughed and laughed. The warmth was surging through my body, I had to dance.
