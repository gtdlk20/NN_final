I lost sight of what was happening around this point, not as though I didnt know the plan, I just didnt care what we were doing.  I had already lost sight of going to Scarborough earlier on that night, however I still wanted to go.  The car headed into an abyss of people as we neared our destination.  I looked out the window with ore as hundreds of attractive women wearing close to nothing dashed past.   I didnt even realize we had stopped before my mates were pushing me out of the car.
