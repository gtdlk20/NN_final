For starters, know that I've always loved dancing and have been to raves before (yeh, I was the one of the FEW who was not on any drug at raves). So I'm not new to the scene, just new to the drug. I had a chance to see Oakenfold one night and I was told if I was going to do X, this was the time. Unfortunately, my X-experienced friends were unable to go, but I really wanted to do this, and I was going to go there with some acquaintance friends of mine. I ended up meeting them there but they were not rolling, just sitting at the bar and drinking. Not quite what I was expecting, as I was told X was something you needed to do with friends (and one of these friend TOLD me I should do the X, so I ~thought~ they would be rolling too). While they were content to sit at the bar, once I was rolling I had to hit the dance floor, so I was pretty much by myself, at a club, doing my very first 'real' drug. Needless to say, I was very anxious about what was going to happen.
