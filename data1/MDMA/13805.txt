Eager to kick off the weekend I sat at my desk rifling through a container of substances.  I already knew what the choice would be; who was I kidding.  MDMA has been the material of choice lately.  I have had the idea of a very large MDMA experience in the back of my mind for a while now.  Through all my recent usage the substance has not lost its magic, but it has certainly lost some of its sparkle and shine.  I decide to mix ROAs at high dosage levels to try and get a real rush and liftoff to a heavy roll despite my current tolerances.  A euphoric fun time is the extent of what I hope to achieve.  My attention is drawn to round numbers, and I elect 1000 mg oral, 500 mg insufflated and 250 mg intravenous as my target intake.  I analyze the safety of this dosage using several harm reduction websites as well as consulting my recent experience journal entries.  I discuss my intentions with a knowledgeable friend.  We specifically examine the potential physical risks I might be opening myself up to.  Although tolerance is a bit of a mystery factor, I decide I am comfortable to proceed as planned.  My recent dosages (including the day before) have been increasing drastically in recent weeks, from what I would consider my normal comfortable amounts (0  250 mg).  I take comfort in knowing that someone is aware of my plan in case things go south and they are prepared to act as necessary to assist in my safety.
