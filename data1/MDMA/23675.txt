By this point in time, it was quite dark outside, but it was a lovely evening with a full moon and low clouds (with Colorado's Rocky Mountain range as a backdrop.)  During a smoke break outside, I melded with a deck chair, absolutely content to just look up at the sky, and try to focus on the (now overly bright) full moon among the clouds. Focusing on such a bright object at the time was quite impossible, but I was content with losing myself in the expansive night sky.
