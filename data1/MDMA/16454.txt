Â• I was also able to go through 1.06 g in total over around a 12 hour period. I wouldn't recommend redosing more than once, as I am set for a really low couple of days. And besides, I've heard there's a ceiling effect dose which is relatively low, depending on the consumer's constitution. Maybe I will do the bare minimum next time, and go out to a dance venue rather than staying in and attempting to melt my mental faculties.
