I decided that I had to use the bathroom and tried to get up only to find that I fell right back into the bed. I made it to the bathroom after what seemed like hours. The light in the bathroom was blinding but I did what I had to do and got back to the bedroom. Brian then left the room for what seemed like hours and when her returned he told me that he puked. I had been getting that feeling all night, but had forced myself not to. I think I slept that night unless I was just in a hole. I guess I will never know.
