After a few minutes my body starts to unlock and I proceed to dry off then it hits me, all the water/Gatorade I've been drinking to stay hydrated comes, the toilet bowl literally overflows with my puke. I flush by I puke for a few good solid minutes thinking I will die from not being able to breath. I lay on my side so if I did puke again I wouldnt choke on my puke.
