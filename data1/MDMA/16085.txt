We were both happy and euphoric, smiling and laughing a lot when we finally reached the beach. We took off our shoes and started walking on the sand. The tactile sensation on my foot was awesome, the sand seemed like a very soft thing, like walking in velvet. I was feeling quite floaty at the time as well, but the real high began when we both sat down on the sand and begun to talk about our lives. I told all my life problems to a girl I had met a couple days before, and so did she. I wouldn't do this at all if I was sober, I am a pretty reservated person, but at that time, it didn't matters, I trusted her more than I would trust my best friend if I was sober. She also told me her problems, and I hugged her and said 'não te preocupes, não importa o que aconteça, estarei sempre ao teu lado, para sempre' ('don't worry, no matter what happens I will always be on your side, forever' in portuguese :) ). That was intended by both of us as a declaration of love, and we kissed.
