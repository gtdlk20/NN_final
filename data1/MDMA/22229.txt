At approximately 1AM, I remember noticing that the cannabis was wearing off. Suddenly, I realized that my fingers were hurting. I looked at my hands to discover I was gripped the armrests of the chair I was in as hard as I could. The onset was extremely quick and unnerving, as it had been more than 2 and 1/2 hours since ingestion, I was not expected the Ecstasy to really do anything for me, especially since it hit my friend only 40 minutes after ingestion. I left the room, and my friend followed. Looking in the mirror, I noticed my pupils were dilated, but not to the amount that my friends were. Having a bit of an anxiety attack, my friend suggested that I lie down. I relaxed after talking with him for a bit, and he left the room after a few minutes. At this point I was able to focus on what I was feeling.
