I started raving after breaking up with a girl. I don't want to say this, but it was probably the e that got me out of my slump. When I first rolled, I saw the world in a whole new light. I just remember feeling sooo loved and euphoric. I soon forgot about my worries and sadness. That night changed me forever. I had never felt like I belonged anywhere as much as I did at the rave. This incredible techno music was tingling my bones and brain. People all around me were dancing, smiling, and hugging. It was beautiful. I became a party kid.
