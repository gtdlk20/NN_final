After 30 minutes, I felt a slight buzz, not totally rolling. I checked my pulse and I was at a normal rate.  I decided after 2 hours that I'd go ahead and take my other 1/4.  15 minutes later, I was rolling out of my mind.  I was actually kind of scared how hard I was rolling.  I could barely stand up.  Totally a better experience than my last.  My heart rate stayed at a normal rate and I experienced no irregular beats.
