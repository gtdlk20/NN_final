After walking into the house, it seemed so gorgeous to me. The orange and purple walls seemed like they were radiating. The house was very cool, which felt nice because it was so hot outside. I messed around on her computer for a bit while the guy that was with us decided to make a ouija board. While he was making that, I decided to sit and talk with my friends. There were brand new leather couches in the living room and they felt AMAZING to touch. They were so soft, it felt like I was touching leather for the first time.
