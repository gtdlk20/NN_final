A while later he brought out some glow-sticks he has attached to some shoe-strings. Being an experienced 'raver', he proceeded to perform a light show for me. The glow-sticks were no longer sticks attached to shoestrings. They became this pulsating, ever-changing, living body of light. Above, below, side-to-side, light. A moving stick of light became a long infinite swril of color. What I found even more thrilling was when I took over and moved the lights around for him. I could move the the music, listen, watch the lights, and do something that amazed him. I got great satisfaction knowing it was me who was 'tripping' him out.
