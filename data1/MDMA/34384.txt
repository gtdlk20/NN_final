i chilled and listened to music for a long time. then i looked up at my other friend and all of a sudden her face morphed into mine. it was very strange looking at my face on someone else's body and the other me started to talk even though i couldnt hear what i was saying. i kept closing my eyes and reopening them to see my friends real face but her face would not stop morphing. this was the coolest e i have had. i used to be able to morph peoples faces when i first started rolling but now its hard to even fall into an e hole because i have done it so much.
