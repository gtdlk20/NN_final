I was a rockstar! I played air guitar on the back porch for upwards of 10 minutes, singing to myself. At this point I had closed eye visuals of beautiful crystal lattice patterns melding into whatever I wanted them too. The most enjoyable however, was the physical movement. If I had had a Djembe drum or something at one point, I would've been in heaven, but I had to make do with imagining I was in a dream world. I used my body to slowly cut through the air. Anyone watching would have thought I was doing some funky Tai Chi or similar.
