I lie back down and look out towards the Oak Tree once again.  The beauty of the monochromatic nature scene is astounding.  The blacks are as pure as the depths of a midnight sky and the whites as crisp and bright as newly fallen snow shining with the suns glare.  I peer around, inspecting the view outside my window top to bottom and left to right.  As I shift my gaze around I have the surreal sensation that I am in a black and white photograph.  Nothing seems to be moving or changing besides the focus point of my vision.  It is hard to place my finger on the proper words to describe how I feel but I feel like I am not a being in the world any longer.  I seem to be a piece of this new world that feels almost two-dimensional and three-dimensional at the same time.  Shifting my gaze around seems to move my physical body around the scene it is taking in.  My physical position doesnt necessarily feel as though it is maneuvering or changing position, but I seem to gain a new perspective or vantage point as I shift the focus of my eyes.
