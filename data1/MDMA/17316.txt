OK.  I feel FANTASTIC.  Simply everything and everyone just looks and feels amazing.  I am just inhaling the night air deeply through my mouth alternating with my very much opened up nasal passages. Everything feels super crisp and fantastic and the sweatshirt I was wearing felt very soft.  I smoked my first bowl of the night as this point (I wanted to gather some of the effects from baseline first) and it very much intensified the whole experience and made it have an almost trippy feel. I was having some minor difficulties walking due to my legs doing a very slight wobble. I was also clenching my jaw heavily and we all chewed many pieces of some kind of very fruity bubblicious gum and it just tasted and felt so good in my mouth.  I kept just walking around and then sitting down at random places and just feeling patches of grass while staring at the massive bonfire. Then I would, within 5 minutes, get up a stagger to another spot and sit down there instead, with no real reason for doing it.  I guess I wanted to see the fire from every angle. I was great entertainment for everyone there, as they had all rolled many times previously and knew exactly what I was feeling.  I was bobbing my head enthusiastically to the county music and rock that they had playing, and I will just say I normally NEVER listen to country music.  Everything just felt fantastic and I was having very entertaining, humorous conversations with everyone there, while normally I am sort of anxious and reserved, especially with strangers, but all of these people felt like they all just wanted me to have a great time with my first roll, and they gave me random advice, like jumping around a bit to get blood flowing, etc.
