However, its become more and more evident on my mind, more like a fetish almost. I love philosophy and theories/concept of thing to think of while high. Death, has prominently became a interest now. Not in I want to die, actually far from it; the subject just interest me. This is the one thing I have solidly muster from my trips, 'Death itself is not a entity, its like a shadow. Where a shadow only exist with the lack of photons, Death merely exist with the lack of life. When life stops, there will be no death, for there is no life. In order to have one you must have both.'
