Enter hour four, it Peaks and plateaus for a bit, say fuck it and I light up a couple cowboy killers (Marlboro reds) and chain smoke three. This is where it starts to go down hill quickly. After I finish smoking I try to stand and my body starts to lock up. My arms and legs can't move. I try to stand and my body starts to lock up. My arms and legs can't move. However I watch in the scariest way my fingers, tightening side by side into a death grip lock down. I couldn't move my wrist or finger, with my seal hands (for lack of a better term) I open my door and run to the bathroom and somehow manage to get a cold water shower going before I completely lock up. This is Boston in January and my oil heaters arent on in the house except my room to let you know how cold this water was.
