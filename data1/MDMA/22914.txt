T+3h: A mild, gentle roll.  But I'm still not across that 'threshold' where the serotonin dam bursts.  Frustrating.  Very slow onset.  Body temperature all over the place.  Red glow from the bottom of my optical mouse in the dark room very nice!  Make more than the usual number of typos writing this, but can easily pass for straight (I think!).  None of the coming-up feeling or anxiety from oral administration -- just a gentle creeping upon you.  Music is nice but 'normal'.  But then Royksopp is pretty chill when sober too.  Could go to sleep if I wanted to, I think.
