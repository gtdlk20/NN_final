The second half of the roll was pretty wierd, considering everybody was coming down off of their doses. I could actually see the energy decreasing in the room gradually, even though mine was still up. When everybody got up three or four hours later, they all were drinking Coronas with limes stuck in the top. It was pretty funny because they were still partying... I really hadn't experienced this kinda stuff before, considering it was only my second time rolling on MDMA.
