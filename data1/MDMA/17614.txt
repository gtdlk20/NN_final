Around 10 45 ~ 11: I feel that air is sliding and melting against me; at times, in fact, even into me. It is a beautiful symbiotic reaction that occurs everyday that we are alive, but I know it is very much more defined in a clear and not overwhelming way. I feel entirely comfortable moving and grooving to my environment, and verbally transcending into the vibe of my brother's conversation. Intentionally stumbling feels quite gleeful, and adds a different more intense influence to the body sensations.
