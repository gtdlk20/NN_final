The Set: I'm always a little anxious when using any drugs. Practice has given me the strength of will to cope with any mental quirks during the experience. I did not have any particular feelings for or against taking Ecstasy that night. I knew I would be in a controlled situation, A get-together of about 12-15 people. I was with a trusted friend who was also taking Ecstasty.
