I did experience minor hallucinations, especially while looking up at the night sky. (A stuffed teddy bear spent a few moments hopping inbetween clouds and waving, and then was gone for the remainder of the evening.) Although nowhere near the severity of those experienced while under the influence of psilocibin, colours were intensified and sound was amplified internally.
