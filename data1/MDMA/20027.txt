At 4:20 am we decided it would be a nice moment to light up a joint of the bunch we had prepared for the occasion. We usually like to elongate our psychedelic LSD, MDMA or DMT experiences with a bonus cannabis trip.

The result was exactly as expected: like in previous trips, we felt as if we were navigating through reality in a close environment. This time, the room became some sort of spaceship for us. Outside, it was gradually beginning to dawn. The only window, which was covered by an orange curtain, was our only way to peek into the world. The room, which I have known for years and is totally familiar to me, became deformed, its strange 5-wall geometry appeared even more ridiculous, really resembling the front part of a spaceship. Later on, we discussed about this episode and thought that it might in some way be an out-of body experience, in the sense that it involves a feeling of peeking into reality from a neutral, observant position (the spaceship in this case). These sort of curious experience, feeling part of a spaceship or some sort of video game, had also happened to us in a previous MDMA+cannabis trip. We talked about our bizarre thoughts, and smoked about 4 joints. I didnÂ’t feel glitchy like I sometime do when I roll. We finally fell asleep, music still on.
