I felt a little depressed as the effects slowly diminished. I was losing the feeling of confidence and love I had felt just hours earlier. I slowly began to withdraw from the group socially, and by the end of the night I was sitting on the couch again in which I had sat earlier that day before the pill. Back to my shy, normal self. My friends could see it too. The funny fast talking leader I had been had faded. I was once again a listener, not a leader, as I chuckled at my friends jokes, trying to hide the fact that I was slowly slipping back to the drab normality. This drug is truely intense.
