We tried to sleep in the car, but that was impossible.  I made a decision to drive home, which was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.  I was definitely not all there psychologically, but nevertheless...  The drive was incredibly tough because my vision was so altered and my mind a bowl of jello.  It was a two and a half hour drive that seemed an eternity.  To top it off, most of the road was single laned...next to a cliff.  Oh god...and to top it off, halfway home, I saw a bunch of people waving cars to continue on past them.  I slowed down to avoid hitting them and saw, in slow motion, a woman crushed in a car that had toppled over.  Horrible...and image I will never forget.
