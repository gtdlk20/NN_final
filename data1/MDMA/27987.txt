About three and a half hours after I initially came up, I took the second one and felt the effects of it after only half an hour. I walked into the bathroom and noticed this incredibly blood-red colored moth. I tried grabbing it, but it fluttered around. I was convinced I was seeing this moth and the hallucination was making it fly all around. I saw another moth in the corner of the bathroom and grabbed it... this time, somehow actually catching it and holding it between my fingers with it fluttering violently to escape. I walked into the living room where one of the only sober people were there and asked him 'HEY IS THIS REAL?' He replied with 'Yes, too many people are coming in and out of this house, so we're getting a lot of bugs in here... it's kinda annoying'. For some reason, I didn't take this well, because I thought I was totally hallucinating these things. This is where the trip started getting pretty bad...
