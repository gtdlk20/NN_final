My past drug experience has been limited to occasional marijuana usage and hydrocodone. I had wanted to try ecstasy and decided tonight was the night. It was Saturday and M, A, P, F, and I had been trick  r' treating for about an hour. We met up with some friends of M's who really wanted some pot so we all smoked a few bowls in one of M's friends' backyard. We were all really cold and went to M's house where we could smoke more and be warm. We packed the bowls again and smoked a bit more. Now that P and I were high we were a lot less nervous about doing the triple stack of ecstasy that I brought. It was late and we didn't want it to last too long, plus it was both of our first times doing MDMA so we crushed up the pill and snorted a quarter of the pill each.
