The third and final day, I did a full tab of acid but had fewer effects and visuals than the previous day, as often happens with hallucinogens the second day in a row. I was also drinking alcohol moderately throughout the day. Although I was having a really good time partying and hanging out with my friends, by this time I was definitely feeling a bit disappointed in the highs (or lack thereof) I had been experiencing so far that weekend, and decided to basically go all in on the last night.
