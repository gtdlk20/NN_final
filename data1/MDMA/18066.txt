After a weekend of actually partying sober and trying to stay up with friends who were on speed, mdma, and weed I was totally exhausted. We just got back from another run to the store and my friends were spinning records in the living room. I was thinking about heading to bed because I simply didn't have the strength to be up any longer. My friend A offered a hit of a joint before I headed to bed and I was happy to take it. Just as I was making my way to a room to crash in our friend L showed up with a new batch of tabs called Blue Armanis. L was feeling generous and asked if anyone wanted to try the new stuff. In the back of my mind I knew I should have just gone to sleep, in the back of my mind I knew the better thing to do would be just to get the tab and save it for later. It's funny how excitement can override common sense isn't it?
