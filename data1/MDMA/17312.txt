Another 15-20 minutes pass with everyone there just burning stuff, talking and having fun.  The marjority of the people there were already -very- drunk at this point and continued on for the whole night. We are all most definitely feeling pretty nice already.  We are all three very smiley and enthusiastic about things and everyone is getting along good.  Everyone is starting to get a body and head high, and breathing deep and walking around on the poofy, soft grass felt very good. I was especially enjoying it as I had never had such quick and powerful sensations.  I was talking freely to everyone and walking around wide-eyed, feeling like I was on the edge of something. This carries on for about 30 minutes after initial dosing and just gets better and better. Around this time I am feeling very nice, very friendly an just generous all around.  I still had 2 pills left but I had NO need or desire to take them myself.  At this point B came up to me and asked if he could purchase a tab off me and I quickly said yes.  He then told me he didn't have any money, but that if I gave him my cell number he would call me in a day or two when he got payed and give me 30 dollars for one 20 dollar pill.
