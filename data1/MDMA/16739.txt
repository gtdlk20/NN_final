I did not hallucinate the way one would on psychedelics, but I did experience visual effects.  However, we did not take this until after dinnertime and we were camping, so it was very dark.  We had a lantern though and there were some reflective signs nearby, which had a halo/glowing effect.  From the lantern light I could see my surroundings enough to notice an extreme 3-dimensionality, much like watching a 3-d movie.  It really reminded me of looking at one of the magic-eye pictures- not at all the texture of those images, but just how 3-dimensional they look.  It was really intriguing, like there was so much physical space I wasn't seeing before, almost like there could be whole other dimensions folding back on themselves behind the trees, and that I just had to walk around them to see it.  There was just so much more depth to everything.  It also appeared as though I was at the center of everything.  By this I mean that it looked very very slightly as though the ground and trees and sky around me encircled me and ever so slightly folded in over me, if viewed from the side almost like a heart shape.  This was a very mild visual effect, but it gave me a pleasant sensation of being at the center of the entire world.  I also saw tracers on quickly moving objects.  Due to the darkness, I was unable to see if there was any effect on colors, and next time I plan to take Molly during the day so I don't miss this (as I anticipate there would be more intense colors).
