My whole body was limp. It felt like I was tranquilized. I crawled from the bathroom into the living room and laid on the floor in a fetal position with a blanket. After about 10 minutes, I was able to sit up and lay my head on the sofa while sitting on the floor. My arms just dangling from my shoulders like they werent attached. I stayed in that position, moving only to changes sides, for around 2 hours. I enjoyed a warm feeling and the vibrant colors of everything around me as long as I was perfectly still. My head and body felt extremely heavy. It was an overwhelming effort to make the slightest move. Even moving my eyes would bring on the nauseous feeling again. I felt appreciation for things I usually take for granted. I felt like my family issues had workable solutions. The introspection over the following days was much deeper than Ive ever felt. My system simply cannot handle the jolt of coming up on a single dose of 100 mg. Perhaps its dangerous for me to force it by taking a whole dose at one time. I feel there is therapeutic benefit for me in doing this again. I will try graduated dosing the next time.
