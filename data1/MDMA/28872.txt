I'll start off with a little background about myself, I'm a 21 year old healthy male.  My previous experience includes daily cannabis use, I've done mushrooms twice, LSD once, DXM twice, and what was supposed to be MDMA once before (it didnt really count in my mind as I had obtained some tablets that were garbage only lasting about 30 min and just leaving me with an amphetamine tension thereafter), and experimentation with a myriad of pharmaceuticals.
