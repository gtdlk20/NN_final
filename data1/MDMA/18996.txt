The final minor point is that James and I decided that while we were best friends, our relationship was really that of him being the younger brother I never had and my being the older brother he never had.  We now call each other our brothers, and I consider him like a brother, the same way I consider Sarah to be the person who I would have been friends with from age two until forever if she had only moved before senior year.  We are going to forever be friends.  This was another thing we said when we were talking about our friendship.  That even if we lose touch with each other, or fight, or something happens,  one can always trust the other to be there for them if they need it.
