Conclusion: Methylone may downregulate the receptors used for the MDMA high, or it may deplete similar neurotransmitters as MDMA.  Five days is not enough recovery time.  Overall, the MDMA experience was not worth it Â– it was pretty much wasted.  However, the whole point of the experiment was to determine if there was cross-tolerance with methylone, and it appears there is, to quite a large extent!  I hope this information will be passed on to those interested.
