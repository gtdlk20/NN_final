As usual I was excited and got home immediatly and was so anxious that I took the pills without plans.  I was hoping I could get out the house before they hit with my parents around.  I called around, surely I could go somewhere, but no luck, I tried for 30 min and began to get really worried that I would be stuck at home.  This is what scared me, I was in a real bad mind-set, which has never happened before in my 40+  times rolling, I have never had a bad roll in my life.  I figured I could just listen to music and have fun, but I was just so lonely, and was sitting waiting for the pills to kick in and make me 'happy'.
