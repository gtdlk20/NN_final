   I also felt more talkative than ever in my lifetime.  I debated/talked about a myriad different things (worthwhile or not) with everyone who came by, my level of understanding was huge.  I tried dancing for a while and had a seemingly endless energy supply.  But I wanted to talk too much.  I spent the rest of the night in nearly the same place talking to whomever wandered by.
