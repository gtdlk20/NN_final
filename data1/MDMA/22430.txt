We wander around for a bit, admiring the awe-inspiring beauty of nature, and finally decide to go back to the house to see how everyone else is doing. We all convene on my back porch and sit at the table and have a smoke. I notice Rob is missing, and ask Lyle where he went. He said 'I think he went to his room, but I know he's rolling.' 'How do you know that,' I asked. 'Look at the beer Rob couldn't finish,' Lyle said. About that time Rob steps outside with the biggest smile I've ever seen a man have. He sits down and joins us in smoking.
