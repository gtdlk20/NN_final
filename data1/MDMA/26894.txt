This was seriously one of the best conversations of my life. S had told me before that if I had ever tried E, she wouldnt speak to me (her sister is a drug addict and she doesent want me to go down that path), but once I told her I had done it before, she seemed ok with it. Until now; she told me what she really felt. She said that she has seen so many ppl fuck up their lives over drugs and she cared too much about me to let me do it too. I began to cry (this wouldnt be the last time I cried during this conversation). I told her that I wouldnt do it again, I felt happy that she told me this, because I didnt want to ruin our friendship. We also talked about our relationship, and how it hasnt been all that good lately. We talked about trust, and our futures... this made me cry again. It was like I couldnt control my emotions, everything that we talked about just made me burst into tears, I think this is because I have been holding so much back and now that I could let it all out, it was just emotional overload.
