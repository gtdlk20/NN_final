We found a highlighter pen on the floor and began to draw patterns all over each other.  Highlighter in black light on skin is the most beautiful thing ever.  The lines and patterns winked and wiggled at me.  Soon we were all covered with highlighter over every exposed part of our bodies.  We danced together in a circle of beauty.  We got a ride home to our friends apartment around 5 am.  We smoked tons of weed and danced some more.  At 7am we went for a walk to starbucks for coffee.  We were covered in highlighter that had turned a yucky yellow in the daylight.  My hair was dyed bright blue and styled into two buns with glow sticks sticking out to them.  We all had beads and braclets and glowy thingys and we walk into the starbucks and there is like Mozart playing in the starbucks and me and this girl start rave dancing to Mozart.  The atmosphere was just so good, we had all bonded during that night and felt more comfortable in each other presents than we probably are with our families.
