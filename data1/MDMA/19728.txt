T+ 0:40  We leave Wendys and J searches for a gas station. Im starting to have trouble concentrating on whats going on and find myself gazing at the late afternoon sky, not really responding to whatever J is saying to me. I am thinking to myself, okay so I'm feeling it, but it isnt that intense. I probably didnt take very much, I could totally go home after this and no one would be able to tell the difference.
