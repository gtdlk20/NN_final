Alright this has been pretty trippy I know. I just wanted to end of this long ass experience with a little bit about who I am. I was born pretty damn poor and have worked my ass off such that I'm set to graduate from one of the top ten medical schools in america next year. I'm the type of person who worked a second job to sent money to humanitain causes every month. I am utterly repulsed by the fact that I am considered 'a drugie' and someone who engages in felonies every now and then when I want to get a rush and dance for a night. As much as I love X its definetely not the end all in life - like everything its just one part - and it hasn't hurt me in my career. I don't intend to treat patients high no more than I would treat them drunk. I wish this society wouldn't force me to hide and be ashamed of the fact that yes I use some drugs. I know they do or might have certain damaging side effects I have read the research just like drugs I will be prescribing every day have risks and side effects. I am ... peeved ... and I want change God Damn it.
