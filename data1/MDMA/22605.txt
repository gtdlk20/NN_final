I went out with this girl for nearly 3 years, it took me a whole year of emotional and physical energy to get over our breakup. The E brought back feelings that were dormant, feelings that I preferred remain buried and gone. I had her next to me the entire night, holding her, and talking to her with an articulateness I can't usually pull off. I had my head next to hers, and every time I breathed in, it filled me with energy, euphoria ,and a familiar calm and conviction that everything was okay. When she left at 7 in the morning, I was overcome with a strong hangover and slight depression, my after glow was destroyed.
