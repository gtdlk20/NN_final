I had hoped for and expected a heavy roll when I set out weighing and ingesting this dosage of MDMA.  Instead, I received a slower paced and far more meaningful experience.  The visual effects at the beginning of my afternoon were some of the most unique I have experienced on any substance.  The mental condition I found myself in for the duration of the experience was equally special.  Years later I reflect on this day and observe pangs of desire to feel this way again.
