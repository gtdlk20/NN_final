But instead of doing the drug again, I need to find a way to reach this point within myself. That is true happiness. Feel free and open. Crazy people are probably the happiest people alive. Especially if they dont care what other people think of them. If you are insane, in you are narcissistic, in your mind, you have it all and that is plain beautiful. Then again, worrying about other people, it makes other people comfortable. Its so complex to help other people and yourself and the same time. I have trouble finding a balance. I feel bad that I dont open the door between me and my roommate. I dont want her to feel bad or like I am shutting her out. I am not used to being so close to a person, I dont like having to think of things to say to people all the time. I like to think with feelings and abstract ideas. I like to analyze, I like to enjoy my own being without conforming to what is socially acceptable.
