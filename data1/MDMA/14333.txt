Before I had to worry about what other people thought of me and worrying about expressing myself without hurting their feelings. Wait I didnt care at the time, but now I really know I dont have to care about the after effects. I am soooo glad I did this . I was afraid of being stupid when I bought the pills but this is the best thing ever. Drugs are good every once in awhile. Why must people look down on them? If you are the right person, you should really do them every once in awhile to connect with yourself. I really changed my life after the first time doing ecstasy
