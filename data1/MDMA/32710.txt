The latter was by far the most pleasant experience any of us had ever had.  My experience with the substance is pretty much what I see mentioned elsewhere.  However there was one difference.  All of us experienced painful backaches the next day in addition to the 'wiped-out' feeling normally experienced.  The backaches were centered in the lower portion of our backs, and lasted for approx 18 hours.  After about a year of this, we concluded that MDMA was simply too dangerous and we gave it up.
