I got about half way there and I saw like 20 of my friends all sitting in cars on my friends front lawn,  I went up to them and they all started hugging me and rubbing my head and this girl gave me this spinning light show for the ride there,  I was ridding down the rode listening to the gorrilaz and staring at the light show, and it was the most intense ride of my life,  I loved everything, I didnt care about one thing, all I cared about was my music.  I finally get there and we go to this fort in the woods,  theres about 10 kids there all just hanging out, smoking,  having a good time, I just got up and went out side the first and danced and ran around for an hour and it was so much fun,  I hugged a lot of people and it made me really happy.  Its now about 11 and we go back to my friends house to meet up with him,  I'm still rolling pretty hard.  We get there and I give him a hug and he says'Fuck you! I'm so jelous!' and we just laughed.  He turns off the lights and puts on an amazing playlist for the night,  and I just take my spinning light show and start dancing, I didnt care who was looking or how dumb I looked, all I knew was I was having an amazing time.
