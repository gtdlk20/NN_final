I continue to soak up the present.  I dont care about checking the time, as this relates to future and past thoughts  something I still dont have desire for, but am more capable of now, should it be required.  Euphoria is ever so slightly leaking back into my mind.  This is my first measurable awareness of my physical and mental body reconnecting since things went colorless.  Its not overpowering, or even intense, but it is powerful.  This is one of the most spectacularly pleasurable moments of my life.  Certainly ranking near the top among the chemically induced experiences.  The simplicity, cleanliness, and purity of my happy contentedness are ineffable and immeasurable in their endlessness.
