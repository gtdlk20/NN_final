While we were inside there were not many visuals just a few visuals of things creeping around while the lights were off. It was really hard to tell if some of them were real or not. When we went out to the balcony is when it really got weird. We were looking over into the ocean where the land meets the sea and there were sea monsters all over in the water close to land. The sea monsters looked like the sea monsters that were on medieval maps of the ocean. They seemed to be traveling along the shore as if it was a parade. The water was flowing in unnatural ways and there were spouts of water traveling in spirals into the air. I told Sam I felt like we were looking at the land between the living and dead. There were also horses playing in the water galloping into the waves and people walking along the shore. I saw a man with a head of long hair and a long beard with a carriage and horses and pointed him out to Sam. At the time I thought he was Santa clause and exclaimed to Sam Is that Santa Clause?. Sam saw him as well and we watched him travel along the parade with his horses and carriage. We were just in awe of the parade and sat in silence for a long time watching it.
