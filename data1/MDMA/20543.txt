Then I had to get up and walk out of the crowd.  Luckily for me I had two friends with me at the time, they took such good care of me.  All I kept saying to them was 'I love you' 'I love you guys'.  They were my favorite people in the world ever.  They helped me out of the crowd; I went and sat on the wall away from the crowd.  I had some water and relaxed for about 20 minutes.  Then I found me an empty chair and sat for another 15 minutes while my dizziness left me.  As I sat there, my sense of hearing suddenly exploded.  It was as if I could hear every single sound in that club.  I heard every single individual voice as it spoke.  I couldn't tell what they were saying, but I knew from what direction they were coming from.  If I wanted to find one, I could.  My sense of hearing multiplied itself by a thousand.
