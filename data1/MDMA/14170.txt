LSD: August 16, 2015 - Dose 2/3 of 100 mg blotter. Also, two cannabis caramel candies and ¼ of a cannabis brownie. An experience for separate report. Very bad trip that lasted for 12 hours. Extremely dizzy for a week. It took 2 weeks for complete normalcy. Introspection later in the month revealed new perceptions for me. In a nutshell, a trip to hell launched my journey to healing my life.
