I tried to think of what could make the experience better, and the only thing I could think of was Cannabis.  I went downstairs and took three large hits of high grade Cannabis, and I walked back inside.  This intensified the visuals so much that I couldnt concentrate on anything.  I stared off of Ps porch into hallucinogenic space for nearly half an hour.  I felt beyond awesome.  The twitching of my eyes continued and the visuals flickered about.  I was still rolling my eyes in the back of my head, and I was having a true, inner experience.  There was movement about the air and I had what I can only describe as closed-eye movies.  Though there was generally less connection, empathy, and social enhancement than with MDMA, the sheer euphoria was far more intense.  This was what I vaguely pictured MDMA to be like when I first tried it.  With my use of Methylone, I started to realize some of the things that drew me away from these types of entactogens.  There was something feminine that I found about them.
