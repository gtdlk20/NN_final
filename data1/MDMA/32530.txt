I started to talk about things and people. Gabriel told me that I was talking about everything so beautifully. I put on Stereolab and felt the music flow though my body entering my fingers and caressing my face. I kept rubbing my knees and singing the songs. I thought about my world, my family, my friends, my ex. I felt happy and safe. I never wanted to leave the state I wanted to stay in my small xA and talk with Gabriel and Sebra. We brought orange juice at 7-11 and decided where to go at 3:30am in Los Angeles. I recommended Griffith Park so we went. I knew of a back trail and in the night we walked high up the mountain to a spectacular view of the city and its neighboring hills. The lights glittered like a million candles glimmering in a dark room. The tall homes under us were so close we could see the backyards. I felt at peace up there in the high sky looking down at the city I called my home. I though about my ex-boyfriend and how it took X for me to feel the feeling of let go for him. I was so happy and although I know the next day would be another challenge it was worth it. Worth it so that I can live and be awake to witness the beauty of the world and all it has to give to me as I to her.
