Ecstasy has always been a weak spot for me, I never turn down a pill.  I have rolled on multiple occasions, mostly with my long-term boyfriend. When we are under the influence of MDMA together, we tend to open up to many of our problems and things get resolved, and stay resolved after our trip.  The particular experience I would like to write about, however, is the first time I consumed ecstasy with a group of friends.
