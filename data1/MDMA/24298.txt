        But...and this is the real meat of it...from this trip I think I finally have a good grasp of the drug's psychological effects.   At first I thought of it as removing your fears, but that's not quite it:   The sense of self preservation is still perfectly intact.    Now, I would rather confidently describe the effect as a dissabling of ego-defense mechanisms.   On MDMA I was very open about the things that I really wanted to talk about but was afraid to share, while still having no trouble holding my tounge about other personal information (which fits government research that determined MDMA wasn't usefull as a 'truth serum'.)    I would theorize that when bad things happen to people we tend to try to supress them, denying the importance of the injuries we have suffered ('I'm not that weak!  I don't care!) or the harm we have done to others ('Hey, I wasn't that bad a person!)   The strange, extraordinary effect of the MDMA was that, for a few precious hours, I was able to face it all without evasion:  Yes, people really HAD hurt me that badly, and yes, I had really hurt other people that badly and there was no good excuse.   And in that moment of absolute, unblinking emotional honesty comes the chance to forgive.   To forgive yourself for the rotten things you've done out of pain or fear.   To forgive the rotten things that have been done to you by people suffering from their own pain and fear, because, having let yourself understand their motivations, you no longer hate them.     Facing your inner feelings without fear, you begin to understand.   As you begin to understand, you become able to forgive and embrace yourself and others without resentment of what's past and gone.   It's been weeks since this experience, and I still feel like singing in public (and believe me, I'm no Pavoratti.)  A weight on my soul has been lifted.   MDMA is not an answer--but it may give the chance to find the answers to your problems yourself.
