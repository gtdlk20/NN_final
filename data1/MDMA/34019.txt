After that experience I always get paranoid and I am never able to dance. Until this weekend when I went to a club in New York City where I live (the club will remain nameless) and I took one pill and I was back to old self. I did not leave the dance floor once. I just danced and hugged and kissed everybody that I was with.  I think that my Cancun experience has finally left my mind and I can finally enjoy the feeling of complete XTC again.
