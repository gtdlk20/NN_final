I dont want the effects to go away. I really hope they stay. Time to call my friend yet? No idea, checks phone of when he called me. I dont know if I want to call him or keep typing. I really want to work on school too. I want to do 3 things at once, and yes I feel like I can. Thinking of putting this on erowid. I hope it can stay on there. Most people just have the clean dry effects and what they feel. But I think if I put this up, I could really put someone in my shoes. Isnt that what browzing drugs on erowid is about? Why havent more people done this? Do they get deleted off? Do people just not care about hearing peoples personal lives? I think in order to truly understand a persons experience is to understand the life that it is linked to, because other wise?
