T+ 0:50  I sit there on the SkyTrain, with my entire body shaking uncontrollably and my eyes flicking around so fast that I can hardly see. I try for several minutes to set my eyes still for long enough to see my reflection in the back of my ipod. When I finally do, I see that my pupils have swallowed my irises. And my face is meaningless and unfamiliar. This is definitely the highest Ive ever been. I dont know what to do with myself so I call a friend, Z. It feels good talking to someone although I can hardly communicate.
