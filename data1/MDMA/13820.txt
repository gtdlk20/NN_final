I take a moment to wipe down my desk with a cleaning agent.  I retrieve a piece of Thera-Band (my tourniquet), a new packaged syringe, some bio-stat water, several cotton balls, and rubbing alcohol.  I lay out these items on the desk neatly.  Intravenous dosing is something I do not do often, but have leveraged recently to combat the cost of stimulant material required to achieve my desired level of effects as my tolerance increases.  I also have used this method to explore compounds I know well, and wish to know more completely.  The process still feels intimidating to me.
