 We had come down quite a bit, but we were still feeling considerably good, because the last pill and a half were still working their magic. This was when we began to drink some beer. It really eases the shitty feelings that you get when you comedown. And it makes sense  look at anyone that drinks out their sorrows, its the same thing. But I try to be very careful when drinking alcohol to ease a comedown, because the next day the hangover is ridiculously amplified from the comedown. Anyways, around this point, somebody knocked on our door. It was startling. I realized that it was past 3AM and we were still blasting music in a small hotel. I quickly got up and turned down the music to a low level and put on some Radiohead and kicked back. We never answered the door though. I began to get cold so I threw my robe on me, and fell asleep next to C. A couple hours later C woke me up and requested that we switch beds to sleep more. We were simply laying on top of the bed, in our robes. I turned out out the lights, switched beds, and fell back asleep.
