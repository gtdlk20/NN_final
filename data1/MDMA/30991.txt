I don't know if there are 'better' pills than others when it comes to ecstacy. However, when the pills finally kicked in, I was in a very euphoric state. I found myself experiencing a lot of the stereotypical events that are experienced when taking ecstacy: chills, jaw clenching, increased alertness and sensitivity to touch. My friend and I got to the point where we were annoying other friends, we would touch each other's hands and exclaim 'you're so soft!!' 'Nooo...you're so soft!!' It was a fun experience. My heart was racing, I felt like I was at the top of the world. The euphoria spread throughout my entire body, however, the chills were unimaginable for me. It was a cooler night, around 50 degrees, and we had a fire going. I was so cold I couldn't get away from the fire. I would walk 20 feet and had to get right back because I was like ice. I had on jeans, shoes, socks, t-shirt, sweatshirt, and a jacket, none of that protected against the cold feeling caused by the drug.
