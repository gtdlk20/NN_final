   M___ and I left the party and were back at my place by 8 AM.  When we stopped the car I started talking again, in the driveway, for another hour and a half...  Common sense more than anything told us we SHOULD be tired so went went to bed.  In bed we talked...  And talked...  By this point we were obviously suspicious that there was a little (a lot?) more in our X than MDMA or MDA.
