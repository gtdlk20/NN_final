3:00 - 5:00 PM: Got back home, still very much so rolling.  Immediately put on my live DJ Tiesto DVD and blasted it, danced around some more, ate laffy taffy, drank Powerade.  Then we cuddled on the couch for the next 2 hrs, as the roll began to wear off.  Sat there cuddled up, in a completely content, amazingly comfortable state.  Everything felt right, everything felt perfect in our lives.  Nothing but smiles and hugs. Everything felt right, everything felt perfect in our lives.  Nothing but smiles and hugs.  Could not stop listening to music, even though we were beginning to get sleepy.
