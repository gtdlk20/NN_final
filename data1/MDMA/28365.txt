Well I want to start off with that I took X for the first time last decembet about 5 months ago.  I used to be an anti-drug person until about a year ago when I tried pot for the first time and I fell in love with it and now I am a full time smoker. I have my fun with aderall, X, alachol, shrooms, DXM, DMT and nitrous. Considering I'm 17 I know that I'm not going to be doing near as many drugs when I'm older so I figure have my fun, now with the story.
