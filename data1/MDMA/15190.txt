I've taken MDMA about 6-8 times spread out over a period of four years (age 21-25). Lowest dose was probably 40mgs, highest dose around 185 mgs (125 + 60mg booster).  My last dose was ~125 mgs, six months ago.  I smoked pot regularly throughout college, quitting completely around 6 months ago.  I take adderall around exam time, usually a low dose regimen of 10-15 mgs a day for two to three weeks.  I've also experimented with LSD, Mushrooms, and had one terrible experience with DOC.  As the months of complete sobriety pass by, I've noticed the sort of slight sharpening up of my faculties that one would expert.  But this word recall problem has stuck with me, and at month six, is not getting any better, even with the rigorous mental exercise that graduate school puts you through.
