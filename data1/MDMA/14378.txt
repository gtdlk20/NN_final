Sometimes conversations [on ecstasy] can get so deep with friends that you dont feel bad about what you were talking about at the time, but you feel so bad later. They opened up what they think of you and what drives them crazy and that just leads to hurt feelings. Talking with people you dont know can get rid of that fear and do what we need to do everyday.feel connected with people we dont even know. Just walking down the street, were all in this together. Everyone has their own life story, yet we only think of them as the person who delivers our pizza, the person who does nothing but deliver mail, the person who is a genius at math and has this godly ability to solve any problem in the universe in front of the classroom. But you never think of their personal lives. Imagine, if you could put a number to events, an have every person in the world and anyone that ever existed, into one comprehendable thing, and could count HOW many experiences there are. Okay, you cant  count experiences, but if there was some way to measure it, imagine just HOW intense that would be!!
