Around 12am my brother approached Sebra and I with a bottle of water and placed a tablet in our palms. I looked at Sebra and almost wanted to cry. I had not even taken it yet and I was already happy. I looked at the light blue tablet; it had a crescent engraved in it. I placed it on my tongue and gulped the water down. Sebra did the same and then we hugged each other so tight and told each other that this was going to be a good night.
