About hangover. I have no depression or bad mood or loss of magic. Its the opposite actually what I feel the next day, even though I had a lot of depressive symptoms in the past before trying drugs and family history is also filled with my mum depressive mood. Although the next day after mdma I feel super excited. I open my eyes and I want to get up and start my day. Actually I am never that motivated in the mornings as after mdma. I am a heavy weed smoker and after smoking weed in the mornings I usually have no energy to do something. I am a heavy weed smoker and after smoking weed in the mornings I usually have no energy to do something. But on mdma its totally different. Thats why I guess I liked its so much. No hangover!!!!
