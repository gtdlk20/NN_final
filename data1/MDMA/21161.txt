The next morning we smoked 2 bowls of pot together before we left. I then walked home. As the day began my mood was relatively normal, but as noon approached it had changed dramatically. I sank into a severe depression. I cried all day not knowing exactly why I was crying. I was overwhelmed with sadness for no apparent reason, and spent the day moping around the house in a horrible mood. Everything upset me, small things such as chores became huge tasks. I felt hopeless and just emotionally wrecked. This depression lasted 2 days. Yep. Two days of awfulness.
