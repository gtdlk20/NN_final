6:30pm: It hit me like a ton of bricks, my scalp and my skin tingled, I was getting warm rushes through my body, and one thing too add it was a little to intense at times, I got really dizzy and paranoid I was going to have a heart attack, but that subsided, I was in the car with my dad on the way to an NA meeting, I remember hearing the music on the radio and it was the greatest feeling ever, I felt so content and happy and I felt connected with the music.
