At about the 3.5 hour mark, I hit ++.  There was speculation that this was potentiated by the alcohol.  There were no open-eye visuals during the experience, aside from the sense of vividness.  For a while, I could see some very faint closed-eye visuals - tightly interlaced patterns that slowly shifted.  Around this time I started to feel excessively mellow - at any point I sat or lay down, I had no urge to move at all.  It was as if my inertia had increased: when I sat, I did not want to stop sitting, and when I moved around or was standing, I didn't want to sit.
