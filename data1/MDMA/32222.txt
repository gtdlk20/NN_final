My parent's house is great when your fucked up: there are 3000 cd's from aphex twin to buena vista social club, from the Wu to Bob Marley, there's a fire place with a matrass in front of it and I am allowed to smoke weed inside. The last pill we dropped was at two and we were still high as ever. So naturally(...) we took another half, rolled a joint, aphex twin in the cd player and kicked back on the matrass in the centre of the living room(we didn't lit the fire place) and just started talking. This was really difficult because every 10 minutes we forgot what we were talking about. I had really clear visuals like red stripes on a cd cover wich I looked at for a minute and after looking again disapeared. Also the ceiling had a zebra type of pattern wich was very similair to what the pattern on my exes shirt looked like. So now my question is: who's had green 2000 tabs or white ferrari's and what was in them?!  Could be a combo between MDA and MDMA or maybe it possible to get visuals from just MDMA.
