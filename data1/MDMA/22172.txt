We drive back to our designated meeting spot to hang out for a few hours before Samuel and I crash.  Everyone is extremely happy.  This night has made me strongly believe in the existence of 'contact-highs', for if I had walked into the group without knowing we weren't all rolling, I would have sworn up and down that each one of us had taken ecstasy.
