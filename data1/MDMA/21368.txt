The first time I experienced ecstasy was with some friends  not my very best friends - in a nightclub that was playing only deep/techno music. I was completely sober before taking it and didnt mix it with alcohol or another drug during the effect. I took just one pill (full, not dividing by half), chewed and swallowed it.
