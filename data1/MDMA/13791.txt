This report is unique from most of my other experience reports in two ways.  The first large difference is that tolerance is a factor.  When planning on fully documenting an experience I generally ensure tolerance will not affect my dosages in order to provide more useful data to readers.  I will discuss tolerance in more detail shortly.  The second difference is that I am formalizing notes into this report long after the experience occurred (more than seven years after the event).  Generally, I begin the writing process in the days directly following an experience in order to have things fresh in my mind.
