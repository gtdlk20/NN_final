I started to feel the effects as we walked threw the gates and past the boys in blue. It really did hit me hard, I walked with my friends and my one mate who I had tripped with before guide me into the festival, I remember a lot of things going ' klaidescope ' of whatever the spelling. It was really intense, everything was wobbly, and morphing like good acid should be, for a good 2 or so hours we walked around, meeting new people gathering supply's and just exploring, in that time I was just a mess, I don't remember much in that time. I don't remember much in that time.
