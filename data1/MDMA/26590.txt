I want to write this experience report as like many other I had a weird experience on MDMA and I am still not sure of what really happened that night I am still not sure of what really happened that night I call it a weird experience as it was definitely not a bad trip, I had a couple of those in the past and they were pretty spooky, long and involving 3-4 more people.
