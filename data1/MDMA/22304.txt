I also remember walking down one road and saying 'We can't go down this street, it's too shady.'  I was told there was no one on the street but us.  I tried to ignore the tree people, but peered hard at all the people lining the streets in benches, none of them happy, all staring into space, waiting for something.  As we passed them they would vanish in my peripheral vision.  That was the only time I got a little freaked out.
