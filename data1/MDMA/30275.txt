Ive been smoking chronic since I was 16. Ive been experimenting with stronger drugs since the first time I tried mushrooms. X to me is like a wonder drug.  The reason I say that is every time Im down or the stress that life brings can sometimes be overwhelming, and X has always guided me out of life's troubles. I first time I tried x, I took two pills and had a blast! The second time I tried x, was about two weeks ago.
