I walked all the way around downtown, eventually purely in the interest of finding something to drink. I found nothing, but it didn't bother me until I was about 3 blocks from home. I felt dehydrated, my throat was dry, and I felt like if I did anything else without drinking something I would throw up, or maybe collapse. The feeling did not worsen, and I got home and let the dogs out with no problem.
