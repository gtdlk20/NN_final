00:50 - I am finding it increasingly hard to stay still and instead am beginning to pace, jump, and jog around my apartment instead of moving normally. I am compulsively feeling lots of different surfaces because each new thing is incredibly exciting. At one point I touched my entertainment center which had not been dusted in a while, and when I went to go wash my hands, the water shocked me because it felt like it was flooding deep into my pores. Out loud I could not help myself from saying, whoa. It was strong.
