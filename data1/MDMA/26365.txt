I was surprisingly feeling very relaxed. I personally actually dont define e as a party drug or anything, but more of a spiritually euphoric experience type of drug. But thats just me. Somehow I didnt even feel the need to be around other people and I was able to enjoy it alone. I decided to write my thoughts on paper; I ended up writing 33 pages full of texts about life, philosophy, and everything that I couldve possibly thought of.
