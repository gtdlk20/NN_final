Rolls (E, beans, whatever you call them) lost their magic for me REAL fast.  the first time I took one, I was in heaven.  Like it says on the effects page, I wanted nothing more than to come off and eat another one.  I thought 'this is how i want to feel ALL the time.'  I was super confident, funnier than usual, very open, sweet, and of course, the 'I love you, man...'   It was sweet.
