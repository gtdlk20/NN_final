Not too long ago my sister and I attended a big event (a rave, if you will) in Los Angeles. We picked up the pills (two blue Mercedes) at a hotel about a mile away. I already had one molly (pure mdma powder) and a pink gun. The rave started at 7:00pm, and my sister and I decided to start walking there around 5:15 to get in line since it was such a big event. As we were walking, we already saw plenty of ravers walking there too, wearing the big baggy pants, beads, and giving light shows while walking down Figueroa. We finally arrive, and we saw much less people standing in line than expected. Id say there were about 200 people in front of us, give or take. So I thought to myself, Sweet, well get in super early. So we patiently waited in line, smoking cigarettes, while people watching.
