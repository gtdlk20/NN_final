Every time I've done E I have had a horribly excruciating headache the day (and sometimes several days) after. I decided it was worth it anyway, after a couple times of use because I can only be open and honest when I'm rolling. About the fourth time I did E, everything was great until I started to come down (I was about two hours behind everyone else, so they were already asleep). I felt like I could never be happy again and I hated myself. I felt so lonely and hopeless that I just sobbed and cried for about two hours until I finally fell asleep. It was horrible. I still plan to use E again, and I am hoping that was just a one time experience, but it's not something I wish to repeat. I cried on and off for the next couple days for no good reason, too.
