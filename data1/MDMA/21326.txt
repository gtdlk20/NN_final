I did notice that when I would have individual moments with my wife (hugs, kisses, looking into each other's eyes) I would feel the rush of positivity and euphoria just course through my veins and warm my face.   It was nice to have the magic back.   I think if it had been just the two of us in our apartment with some great music, it would have been near a peak experience.   My wife, who had lost more of the magic than I had, reported similar results.
