+2hrs still high feeling really energetic and was told my pupils look huge. I was talking heaps which I realised but couldnt seem to stop. My short term memory was getting really bad and I was frequently going from one conversation to another losing interest. Had two more bottles of water I just sipped regularly. My temperature was crazy, when I went outside I was instantly cold and my arm hairs stood up, when I went back inside I then got warm again very quickly.
