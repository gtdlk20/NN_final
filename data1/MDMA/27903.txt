Then my vision went black and white, I was floating up to the ceiling with my arms out wide, smiling beautifully.  There were other dancers up there with me, in the same position, arms wide and smiling too.  The music had faded away into the distance.   This continued for a few minutes and just faded out and I was back in the club, the music coming back and I simply carryed on dancing like before.
