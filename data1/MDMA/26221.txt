After that, a lot of depressing stuff happened. A lot of stress came on. Ever since I felt like something has been changed in my mind. Ever since I felt like something has been changed in my mind. I've had about 10 - 15 panic attacks in the past 3 - 4 months following. I never want to do anything, I'm hot and cold, I'm very irritable, I get really scared and nervous. At first I just felt off then I got the panic attacks out of the blue like a month after. Now I have depression, I have random bouts of emotion and crying and nothing feels right anymore. All I know is that it really wasn't worth it if this is the price I pay. I don't know now if the pills may have been dirty, I hear a lot of shit about stars having DXM in them. All I know is that when I talk or think about it I get really antsy, I can't focus on a lot I feel emotionally drained. I haven't done that much E, but I'm scared I fucked my head for good. I'm trying to get past it slowly, but I feel so dull now. Marijuana makes me freak out, EVERYTHING makes me freak out and have a anxiety attack. This isn't who I want to be.
