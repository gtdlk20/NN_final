Open-eye hallucinations began early in the trip and persisted throughout the entire thing. The things I saw were mostly amusing - Es face composed of tiny jigsaw puzzles, red dots floating across his hair, etc. All patterns contained themselves to one discrete area, and never changed or repeated themselves in other places. We talked for many, many hours about things we normally would never think to share, or wouldnt feel comfortable with. E told me his entire life story, and I spent a lot of time playing with his limp dick (in large part out of tactile fascination) and, when prompted, gave my own life history, broken into pieces that my diminished short term memory could handle.
