I awoke the next day happier than usual. Its a bright sunny summer day I thought, I felt It held limitless potential and value. I met T and W at our friends house were we helped clean up. We filled an entire wheelie bin with cans and bottles and pronounced His Australia day party a resounding success. We went to have a cone in the park and after a few set backs, A lost lighter, our preferred spot being taken and some run ins from some less than liked classmates I enjoyed a fat waterfall hit. We sat around on a park bench for a while, absorbing nature. We got back on our bikes to ride around the park after about 15 minutes of sitting. That was a very good bike ride indeed. I was truly free letting the breeze blow through me. I laughed like a maniac and sighed with content. Well, that was my Australia day for 2006.
