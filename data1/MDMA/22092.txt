Junkie style in a spoon after a thorough crushing. No heat applied. I ran them through several 18 gauge filter needles. The result was a cloudy mixture of sterile water and what I only assume is MDMA (and most likely leftover pill matter). I snorted a few of the pills several days prior to the experience and that is my subjective analysis. Note this isn't a chemical analysis, and I put myself at appreciable personal risk trying it.
