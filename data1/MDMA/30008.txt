I took 1 tab of MDMA about 1:00am on December 24th.  The effect of the pill took about 40 minutes to kick in.  At first I had a sick feeling in my entire body, followed by a sudden rush of energy.  A feeling like I would expect from Crystal Meth.  Within 20 minutes of these first effects, I experienced an awareness of touch and sound.  Everything had a softer side to it.
