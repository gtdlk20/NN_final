I had purchased one tablet of ecstasy a couple of hours before I was supposed to go to my sorority's semi-formal. It was a rather small tablet, with faint spots, and no imprint to give me a clue to its possible name. (Its effects, I would later find out, were almost identical to another ecstasy pill I had taken a few months earlier named 'Kangaroo'.) I dropped just about 15 minutes before arriving at the dance's location in SOBE (at about 10:00 p.m.), and by the time we arrived, it had already begun to kick in a little. I waited a while and then, with the help of a cig, the roll kicked in full force.
