About a week later me and my buddy walked to the supplier after school. He had bought one pill and I had saved my pill from the last time. But still being very cautious I only took half of it and gave the other half to my other first-timer friend. I have to admit even though the effects were very faint I still felt very alive and real for once. And in the 4 hours that I had been rolling, I had felt a nice warm feeling of happiness in the world and felt alot more able to talk to people and get into conversations like never before. I felt like most of the people I was with had been rolling too, and that we were all feeling the same feeling in perfect harmony. I would even ask the question 'ya feel me?' almost every scentance... And they always said 'yes'... As if we were on the same page throughout the whole night. It was a very experiencial night and afterwards I felt like doing it again, only now I am ready to experiance the full effects of what we call 'thizz'.
