In conclusion this was the perfect MDMA experience in my mind and I had a hell of a time, as did everyone else.  We really enjoyed seeing one of our favorite artist in the mind set that trance was made to be listened to in.  I've had nothing but positive enlightening and uplifting experiences with this substance, but I remember to treat all psychedelics with great respect they are powerful tools that can be great if used properly (in other words use, dont ab-use).  All I have to say is thank you Dr. Shulgin, if it werent for him we would not have this wonderful chemical.
