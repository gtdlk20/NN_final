I take the pill as the sun is setting. An hour later I had the worst experience of my life. Pacing around the concert hall trying to fight my body from having a seizure or a heart attack. Never have I felt this physically sick. It was absolute psychosis...So I ditch the place and end up walking around downtown Miami for 3 hours until this crap wears off.
