Alright so I peaked right, well I don't think my 'crash' is like most people's ya know?  It doesn't actually hit me until the day after the day.  I think it's because I roll late at night since I work until about 11.30 or sometimes 1.30.  So I roll late then the next morning (about 6) I'm starting to come down.  So it doesn't set in until a day after that.  My crash isn't as much of a crash as it is a numbness.  It's not that I feel bad, I don't feel anything.  I guess I appear to be in a bad mood since I don't really feel like talking to anyone.  The truth is that I'm not in a bad mood, I have zero mood....no good emotions no bad ones.  It's the most severe case of indifference ever...and it's really not all that bad.  I would say a hangover on alcohol is way worse...
