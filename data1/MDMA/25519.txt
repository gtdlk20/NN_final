About an hour later, I was sitting in my friends room getting ready to go out, and I began to turn on. The first feelings were weird and disorienting. I did not have trouble focusing on things when I kept my head still, but when I moved it, things went a little blurry (if you have ever seen Go, the part when the guy first starts turning on the apartment illustrates this feeling well). We then went out to go walk to a party. As we walked, the cool winter air felt good on my skin, like a hot summer day when you open the freezer. I lit up a cigarette, and the smoke felt good going down and back up my throat. I could barely even feel the smoke, but the motion of the air was nice.
