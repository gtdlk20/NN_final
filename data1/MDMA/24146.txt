The thoughts that went through my head starting on the comedown from the 'pure loves' are indescribable to this day.  It falls somewhere between evil and deathlike.  I'm sure it was the entire situation that intensified the comedown, but boy...it was tough either way.  The acid comedown kicked in right where the e-ish effects left off.  Not a good sequence of timing if you ask me.
