So anyway, I finally find the OJ, and was at the counter to pay when I saw her, the most perfect thing I had ever seen. She was a friend of a friend of mine, but all that I knew then was her name (from her name tag) and that my friend said that she liked X, so I invited her to the party when she got off work. I never actually thought that she would actually come over, but at the time I was glad that she did. *I want the reader to understand that if I wasn't on x at the time, I wouldn't of even spoken to her. I would have gotten the OJ asap and gone back to the party.
