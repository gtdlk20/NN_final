9:18 - Well, I think I'm definitely feeling it. I'm pretty fucking happy, and considering recent events, that's saying something. (I had recently gotten in a car accident and gotten arrested for my part in setting a forest fire.) I'm also getting some weird perspective changes. I find myself looking around, cause everything looks new and different. Getting some dry mouth, but I'm staying hydrated. (I had a 20 oz. Pop bottle that I filled with water. I would eventually drink 30-35 oz. Over the course of the night.) It's probably kicking in so fast cause I haven't eaten much of anything in the past couple days. Nothing else is in my system. (Except for the weed, but I have such a tolerance to it by this point that a bowl, smoked by myself, will only get me high for a half-hour or so.)
