Many people who buy MDMA these days buy it in crystals, no longer in caps or pills, so the notion of snorting the stuff probably came pretty naturally when the crystals themselves started being sold in grams and half-grams, rather than individualized doses. I've seen people snort crushed "Ecstasy" pills back in the day, but one never knew what was in those, and I never had the gall to snort it.
