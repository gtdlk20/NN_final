Maybe 20 minutes later, I was feeling something different, some energy and a willing to dance, and I wondered myself: is it the effect that everybody says it is wonderful and magic? It was good, but nothing like they said. 10 minutes later, the drug effect kicked in in fact and I realized that the previously was just placebo. This new effect is unmistakable, nothing in common life can be compared and, when my friends said it was going to be the best experience in my life, they were right. The key word for the ecstasy experience for me is euphoria, I felt an enormously joy, way bigger than ever felt before, it was overflowing, and I couldnt stop smiling. The temperature of the body was a little bit higher but that made it very cozy. Then, the love declaration started, everyone started hugging and feeling emotional in a good way, we felt like brothers and I thanked very much them for this. I was feeling a lot the music, every drop, and transposing this to dancing, sometimes I closed my eyes and felt I was in my own world just enjoying and dancing. I didnt even like deep music, always found it boring, but during the effect it was magic, and after the experience I consider way more cool than before.
