I never did go to sleep.  Eventually I got out of bed and my friend and I spent the day relaxing in the hot tub and trying to eat a little something, although I had no appetite at all for three days to come.  Every time I looked at a reflective surface, such as a window, a black and white movie would play and I would see things that I cannot explain, but very strong and powerful visions.  That night I finally was able to sleep, at least my body was able to sleep.  My mind was still very much working, and when I got up 16 hours later, I felt refreshed, but as if I had been traveling all night.
