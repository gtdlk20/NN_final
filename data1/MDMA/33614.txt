Before, ecstasy took me over.  I couldn't control myself.  Now, after the 10 times I have rolled, I'm not overwhelmed anymore.  Its nothing special now.  Another factor is the crash.  I feel SO AWFUL after a night on ecstasy that I think I would be better off not even taking it.  As soon as the peek ends, I feel drained of all energy.  I am usually depressed for the next 3 days.  Ecstasy isn't even worth taking for me anymore.
