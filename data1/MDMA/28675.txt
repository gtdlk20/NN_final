All in all, I think the MDMA formed a special bond between me and the friends that I went with. We're never going to forget this in our lives and are planning our next roll. I would definitely recommend. Take a testing kit (which we were too stupid to do) and do some research, even though it definitely won't prepare you for it. I also fell in love with the trance scene, and the raving community as a whole much more than I previously did. You could say I made 10,000 best friends that night.
