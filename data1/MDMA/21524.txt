T+ 18:00:  I never ever sleep in.  I wake up today at 12:30pm, which is fine with me.  Last time I ate 1& 1/2 beans and slept only 4 hours, but had the best time of my life, only feeling slightly uneasy the next day.  It's nearing 8:30pm and I am still not feeling great.  After self-proclaiming E the 'best drug ever', my second experience has altered my view slightly.  Although I will not let this be my last experience, I am extremely disappointed that I did not get the experience I had hoped for.
