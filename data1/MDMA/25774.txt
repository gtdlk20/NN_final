So the trip was great, but the after affects suck. The pill I took was called a Jawbreaker, and I guess I was gnashing my teeth a lot (but I don't remember doing so). The next morning my jaw hurt sooo much, and I had chewed up the insides of my cheeks. So my cheeks were all raw and aching, and so were my teeth and jaw. It still hurts, 5 days after I took it. Some other pills I have taken are Stardust, which isn't that great, and Tiny Tarts, which are really good. Jawbreakers have been the best roll, but like I said the pain is hard to handle.
