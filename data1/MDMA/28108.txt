When the MDMA started hitting us I was able to communicate so clearly with Sam about all the relationship problems we have been having. I was finally able to talk about traumatic events in my life that I wasnÂ’t able to communicate before. I was weeping and it was like this flood of built up emotions poured out about this man that I lived with and was unsure if he raped me or not because he would drug me with Ambien when I was a child. We talked about both our problems how we could help each other work on them and apologized for all the awful things we had done to each other in the past.
