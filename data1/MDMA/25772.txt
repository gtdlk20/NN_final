So we drove to our final destination, a hot tub in a private dorm on our college campus. A note about driving: people say that it doesn't impair your ability to drive, but I don't think its a very good idea. It was an extremely short drive, and I felt like speeding all the way there. There were some people in the tub, but it was cool b/c we all got along fine. The water felt GREAT and so did rubbing up against my friend. Everyone thought we were lesbians, but we aren't. It's just that when you are on X, you want to, you have to, touch things. And when you are touching your friends, it's not sexual at all.
