The day of the rave arrived and the MDMA had not yet, arrived, so I was frantically scrounging for an alternative up to the last minute. I promised myself I wasnt going to settle for rolls, having a few pretty mundane experiences on them and being ripped off several different times. I got off of work at 8:00 pm and waited for my friends, H, S, and J to come over so we could all leave in my car. J and S were trying to get some other rolls but there didnt seem to be much hope. H came over, and ended up waiting for S and J for 2 hours, but they were stoned and had gotten in trouble with Ss parents so they ended up not being able to go at all. I started out my journey pissed off I started out my journey pissed off because of their unreliability and the fact that we werent going to be able to get some molly.
