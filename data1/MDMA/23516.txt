The first time that I tried ecstasy, there was nothing. I just finished fighting with my girlfriend and I wanted to use Ecstasy as a way of analyzing my feelings. On ecstasy, I felt a slight rush that quickly lost its novelty. To my disappointment, I quickly found myself wanting to sleep, but unable to. Later that night, I went to my girlfriend's dorm and I cuddled up next to her. The next day, I told her about my roll despite anticipating her disapproval. I didn't regret the roll, but it didn't do very much for me. She was upset over my experience and I felt bad for not talking with her first.
