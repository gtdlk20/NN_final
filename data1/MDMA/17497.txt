7:00 The girls are peaking and valleying (what I call going up and coming down...)  We end up spending the majority of our time in the Mall. Then ... back to the Park!...This goes on until 8:00, we go back home talking about our feelings, they smoke a little pot and then decide they want to go listen to jazz. They mix up some vodka drinks, I drive home and then type this up.
