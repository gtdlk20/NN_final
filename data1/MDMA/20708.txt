I grab a random guy that appeared to be rolling to dance with me. All of a sudden, my legs turned to jello. My body melted into the air. The strobes started going off. My eyes jigged back and forth furiously. I had to sit down. With each step I took my legs sunk deep into the ground. I could not look straight. My eyes were deep in the back of my skull. I tried to close my eyes. Bright swirls of rainbows danced before me. I couldn't breathe. I tried to look around me, and people were staring at me. I felt that they were plotting against me. They did this to me, I thought to myself. I started swinging my arms and yelling at people. A girl came up to me to give me a hug. I couldn't stop crying. She told me that I had to follow her to the bathroom. I clung to her, it felt that I had no legs, they had melted off. I tried to pee, but no luck. This only made me cry more. The lights in the bathroom burned my eyes. It felt like needles. My body started shaking. I sat on the floor.
