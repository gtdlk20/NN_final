That was easily the most memorable part of the night, the night that took my experience with ecstasy to a whole new level.  The rest of the night... After I finished talking to my 'new best friends,' my friend and I went to buy water, and I remember going up to random people saying 'this is my first rave. I'm so happy' and I remember this one raver chick who looked down about something, put on a fake smile and said enthusiastically 'omg me too!' and I believed her and all was still right in the world.  Not a worry in me.  I then proceeded to call my sister and tell her that I was having the best night of my life. And then bought water, and went back into the venue, chewing gum nonstop the whole night (my jaw was a little sore the next day).  The music sounded good and everything, and I slowly started to come down.
