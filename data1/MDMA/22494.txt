I laid down with one of my friends and I began to touch her everywhere again, and she liked it, but she wasn't blowing up like I was, and so she was just relaxing and enjoying it. It was now 3AM, and I still was going really strong 2.5 hours after first taking my tab. I got up and put in a cd by underground trance producer/DJ San Martin that I bought in a little store in Miami. Real underground trancey tribal stuff. And OH MY GOD, it intensified my rush. That night is the night I learned how to dance to trance. Before, I only listened to it, now for whatever reason, I know how to move my body to it. And move it good. For two hours, I danced, not heavy dancing, but wavy, rythmic, slow movements with glowsticks in my hands. The glowsticks were amazing to look at. Even though I was moving them, the trails they made almost made me fall down a couple times. This with the strobe light in combination and then watching the other dude glowstring, I was in heaven. I was in ecstacy. AMAZING amazing feeling. I did this for two hours.
