Time passed and it was about 3:00am and I still was not feeling anything, if anything I was becoming tired.  I was waiting for my brother to go upstairs to bed before I would say anything about it though. Around 3:10 my brother went upstairs to bed and I told Stoner that I still wasn't feeling any effects.  He offered to cut the last pill in half and split it.  I took the half and sat down and played counter-strike for about 15 minutes, around then I noticed myself rubbing the top of my legs and thinking it felt good.  I looked in the mirror and noticed my pupils were huge.  Stoner had noticed and suggested that we go for a walk because we were both getting very talkative and antsy.  This was around 3:30 and it took us about 10 minutes to get out of my basement because we both kept feeling stuff and the stimulation it gave us.
