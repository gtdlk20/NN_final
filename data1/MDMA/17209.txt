The molly snorts easier than coke, but burns much more.  Being a tad bit of a masochist, I love the burn and am disappointed when it subsides after a few minutes.  I then take the capsule with a can of soda.  We sit and talk for a while longer, then G asks B for a ride home to shower.  I eagerly agree to accompany them, hoping to be near G when I start to come up.  I placebo a lot on the ride to GÂ’s house, trying to convince myself I am coming up when really I am not.  We drop G off and I climb into the front seat.
