It was about 11:00 at that time, and Tom was still sitting in his chair motionless.  His hand placed on his chin as if deep in intellectual thought.  Me and KB were already starting to bounce around a little bit.  I was feeling good guys... actually I was feeling fucking great.  My head was clear, not like alchohol that everyone can tell you were drunk.  I was just happy.  Kathy Lee happy, which was just incomprehensible to me.  I had never been that happy.
