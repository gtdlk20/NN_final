THE EXPERIENCE: T+3 to T+8 All soft things feel good, Dr.pepper tastes so good I refuse to believe its only soda. Must rub and move and squeeze own body and soft things. Hot bath is so good I could not speak, Cold water on head was angel annointing me. Music is divine and I bonded with it- use pretty stuff w/choir vocals, Talked about anything, no one was offended, wanted for everything to be well, violence and hate doesn't exist, me and my rolling kin are the only thing in the world.Happier than I've ever thought I could be. I bonded with rolling friends, objects have a message of love for you, you can speak to them, and they send you a message back sometimes.Others are evil, like am aztec skull decoration I saw. Not hallucinating but you feel like you can see heaven.  Literally you writhe in pure euphoric pleasure that is so wonderful I cannot begin to describe it. It lasts longer than it really does.
