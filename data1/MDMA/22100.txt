It wasnÂ’t worth the damage to my veins. I had a little more trouble getting to sleep than with previous ecstasy experiences. Intranasal and oral administration have given me better experiences in the past. Duration of peak was not noticeably increased with dose. Unnecessarily dangerous. After trying it twice, I have no desire to inject ecstasy again. Additionally, my desire to use the drug again has waned since then.
