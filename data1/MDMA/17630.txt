1:46 AM: We saunter out of the sliding glass door of the apartment, leading into the grassy court yard with a swing set in the middle. The dense mass of giant fur trees in the distance swayed and flopped against each other in the embrace of the wind. My body felt like it was naturally swaying in a very similar manner upon seeing the tree's motions. The ghostly white, thin clouds drifted above them in the starry dark blue sky, accentuated by diamond - like color patters of purple and magenta. We sat in the grass and glared wide eyed into the massive dome of the clear night sky above us as we smoked a cigar close to one another.
