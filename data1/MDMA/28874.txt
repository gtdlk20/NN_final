The event had been planned out well in advance as we were going to see the king of trance, Tiesto.  I was stoked as he only does a handful of shows in the U.S. Every year and one of those locations was my city.  The concert was to take place at a fairly upscale club in the downtown of our city.  Being sort an experienced psychonaut and having read all there is to know about a vast number of psychedelic substances.  I wanted to have the best experience for myself and my partner in mind expansion research, the Dr. Gonzo to my Raoul Duke, well call him M.  I had acquired a hook up of some supposed high quality tablets of MDMA that were known around here as orange maseratis, as they were orange and had the Maserati symbol (a trident) stamped on them.  We were going to be going with some female companions, well call them J and L.  I had advised everyone to, that morning, start drinking plenty of water and gave them one multivitamin and one 100mg 5-HTP capsule to be taken that morning.
