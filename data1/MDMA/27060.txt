I was pretty excited, but kept my cool as I parked at a beautiful outdoor venue in Colorado for a rave. I drank a 24 oz can of a flavored malted beverage, and half of a shot of flavored vodka, a bottle of water. I smoked one large hit of marijuana to ensure I was calm enough to allow the effects of the MDMA that I was about to ingest would hit me.
