I'm a 44 year old mom of two college students, (daughters), aged 22 and soon to be 21.  A couple of weeks ago my oldest daughter decided she wanted to try shrooms, acid, MDMA, in any order.  She got a gram of MDMA so that we could all do it together, but instead of waiting, she went ahead and tried it. Of course I didn't get to help with her preload or postload.  My youngest daughter and her friend wanted to try it, so I set aside a Saturday afternoon, went and got 5-HTP, melatonin, magnesium, ginger, the works.
