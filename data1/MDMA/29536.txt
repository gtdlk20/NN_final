The spill over of powers from the dream world into the real world is the most intriguing experience of my life and as a philosophy student it has positively realigned my perceptions. I am now doing a dissertation based on some of the ideas I took from my trip.   As a final note I would like to express my hope that anyone who reads this has similar experiences on their favourite hallucinogens and to say never underestimate the power of the human brain.
