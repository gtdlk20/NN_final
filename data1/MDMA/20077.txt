When we began coming down, E asked if I wanted to extend the trip, and I was a bit apprehensive about overdoing it, especially in light of a recent mood episode, and the uncertainty of comedown effects, but I said IÂ’d do more if he would. We split one of the 200 mg doses evenly and went again, and I felt a slight bump but had no extreme climb like the beginning. Some time later we decided to extend it one more time, but to do full doses this time to see if we could get a full effect. As I recall, I had a slight bump without feeling too different, but remained in a state of connectedness and tranquility for a long time.
