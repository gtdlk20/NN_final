The drive is very relaxing and my high continues to shift into a more philosophical mode.  The landscape is achingly beautiful and I am aware of every little detail that would normally escape my attention.  Trees ripple in the breeze and the sight sparks feelings of divinity.  The three of us begin talking about life and purposes, about energy and matter and vibrations.  God and light and the shadow of the human psyche.  The conversation is deeply fulfilling, and I feel incredibly in-tune with those around me.
