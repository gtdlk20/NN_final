I found out that my friend was going to be getting some ecstacy. I had never tried it, and I was a little hesitant about trying it at first. I had previously just stuck to weed, and this seemed to be a bit more of a hardcore drug. I eventually decided to drop, and drank it down with some orange juice. One of my friends had dropped an hour before me, so he was beginning to turn on when I dropped.
