I wanted my g/f to try it with me, but she was paranoid, so i took it by myself. I was just sitting in our place with her, just hanging out, when about after 45mins after i took my pill i started to feel this beautiful europhic feeling come over me. I just felt so good, and i wanted to listen to music, so we played some cd's. about an hour and 1/2 had past and i was feeling better and better as the minutes went on. I had to get up and dance, so we started to dance to the music that was playing, it didn;t matter what was playing, it sounded so good. And the feelings i had towards my g/f were growing out of control. I started to get really close and feeling her up as we were dancing, everytime she touched me it felt so wonderful. And once we started to kiss, it felt so good, like nothing ever felt this good before. I kept telling her this is the best time i've ever had in my life. I tried to explain how great i was feeling, but just couldn;t find the words. it was so amazing. After dancing for a couple of hrs, we laid down on the couch and started making out.
