The Experience: My friend and I approach drugs from a direction of experimentation, experience, and respect for their power. He has taken Ecstasy twice, I had never used it. We wanted a way to remain fairly lucid so we could guide the first time smokers, and make sure everyone felt comfortable, yet still have fun. After taking the Ecstasy about 10:30PM, we proceeded to go outside and set up the gravity bong. We both had a small taste of the marijuana (1 small hit off a pipe), but we wanted to make sure our experience was not tainted, so we could tell what the Ecstasy was doing. The Ecstasy hit my friend about 40 minutes after ingestion, he is a much lighter bodyweight, and he hadn't eaten prior to taking MDMA. His pupils were greatly enlarged, and he pursued conversation with great enthusiasm. Aware of his intoxication, he remained lucid the entire time.
