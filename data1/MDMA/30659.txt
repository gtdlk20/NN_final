My friend started to feel sick to his stomach about 20 minutes after we took it, and almost vomited. But the nausea went away and he started feeling it. After about 1 hour and 20 minutes I suddenly got really nauseous and went to the bathroom and vomited quite a bit. I didn't see any of the blue pill in my vomit so I figured the pill had absorbed. I really didn't feel it like I thought but I think I still was rolling a bit. But all I wanted to do was sit in my room for the rest of the night. My friend who had taken the same pill as me rolled and felt great the entire night.
