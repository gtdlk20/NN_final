We got to the festival at about 8PM, and given that it ended at 10AM, we had about 14 hours to rave. We were all in amazing spirits (despite not yet getting molly) and decided to get into the vibe and start dancing before we did so. We were getting lost in the music and in our own company without the MDMA, creating an amazing setting that would make our roll fantastic.
