In early November, I went with 8 friends to a music festival in a different city. The lineup for the festival was insane - it had dozens of really good trance (which I didn't particularly like at the time) DJs as well as popular Deep House DJs. Having experimented with LSD before, I had been very interested in trying MDMA, which several other friends of mine had told me was an unreal experience. My friends, who had mostly only tried weed before, told me that they were down to roll at the festival, and even better, one of them could get some high-quality MDMA from their dealer.
