the effect had just begun to increase, but i was completely aware of what was going on.  at the exit of the maze i was greeted by a woman who gave me a beer bottle cap.  i took it and put it into my pocket.  the woman was perhaps fifty or sixty years old and dressed in a genie costume.  I believe she called herself 'Madame' something. and i thought her to be somewhat 'weird'.
