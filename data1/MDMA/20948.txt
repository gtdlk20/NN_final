I took half of a dose of MDMA with some close friends - it was a very pleasant and loving experience. We all hugged and kissed and had a great time together. In the beginning it felt very strange, I was very dizzy and extremely sensitive to loud sounds and lights - I was afraid to have a seizure considering my migraines, but after only a couple of minutes I felt great and peaceful. When I got home with my partner, we tried having sex and I was amazed by the fact that it didn't hurt at all. I did feel some slight discomfort at the beginning but that is all.
