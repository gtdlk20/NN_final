What you have to understand is that we had that 'relationship' talk a month before, and it wasn't going to happen. We were both scared, and a very recent breakup meant she was simply unable to step out on that ledge again (maybe ever). Being able to have her see me and me be with her while high on Ecstasy gave us an entirely new perspective on who we were and who we wanted to be with each other.
