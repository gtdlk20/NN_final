An hour later, I was rolling pretty hard. I kept on writing, as my writing became worse and worse. I was still making some sense but my writing was barely readable and I couldnÂ’t write the letters properly. I spent another hour on my computer, sucking on a soother, writing in my book, and listening to more music. It was really chill. I was sweating pretty bad though, and I forgot to drink much water so that was pretty bad. My throat hurt pretty bad the next morning.
