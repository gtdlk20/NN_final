I was in las Vegas for a music festival.  I had never done E before, but I had been eating/blowing Mali all day.  At the time, I had no idea the normal dosage, so I was pretty much doing it like coke.  When my bag was out, someone handed me an E pill.  It started as the classic first roll experience as far as I've heard.  The music was incredible.  Someone gave me a backrub while listening to arcade fire, someone gave me glowsticks at the Widespread Panic show, I've never been happier.
