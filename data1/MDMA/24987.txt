Stretching out on the floor, right there in the club, on my stomach, I put my trust in him and relaxed. People gathered around in a circle. Alex asked me to put my menthol mask on, and my sinuses were filled with its sweet, pungent vapor. I relaxed further and my eyes unfocused on the grainy floor. I felt my arms being lifetd by Alex, his grip strong around my mid-forearm. I was then lifted, just my head, shoulders, and chest off the ground. I tensed but was soothed by the urgings of Alex. I closed my eyes. My head was now hanging limp between my upstretched arms.
