Well, saturday we arrived at the rave at 12:30 am ..dropped ...by 2:00 am we were dancing on a roll it was wonderful the bass pounding through' our bodies was just soooo pleasurable. the people were so cool and the the lights on the dance floor were amazing the d.j.'s just knew what to do to make us rush to the sound....all in all it was a experience we will do again...at 36 and 43 years old we have found a new way of expression (we are both artists) and it feels great...the 'younger' crowd seemed to sense our awkwardness about the age thing and welcomed us. We both left the rave feeling a renewed hope for the world, the next generation does feel what we felt when we were young having both grown up in the aftermath of the 60's. We will rave again....we even glow sticked!
