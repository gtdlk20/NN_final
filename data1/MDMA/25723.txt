Thirty or so minutes passes, totally not thinking about it and having a decent time, when - the rush hits. I mean the RUSH HITS. I felt like the world was opening up to me, I felt like my limbs were screaming out in celebration of life. During the peak I only stood there at the end of the dance floor ... and reveled. I reveled in how my skin felt, how my limbs floated, how incredibly sensuous the dancing bodies around me were. As I start to come down - I start to dance, and I sank into myself while knowing the world at the same time. I want the whole world to dance with me and in some ways it is. The club is closing and we have to go. As we exit it's just me and my friend walking to the car. I explode in excitement. I believe the exact language was something like, 'Oh my god. Oh my god this stuff is incredible!' I have a permanent smile for the rest of the night and I'm in rapture.
