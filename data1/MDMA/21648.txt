At this point, I stopped keeping the journal. We went to Perkins, which is open 24/7, and stayed there for maybe an hour, then left. I had two cups of coffee while there. When we got home, I got in bed, but I had no interest in sleeping. So I put on the Secret Machines CD, and after that was done, watched a movie. I went to my class at 9, after being up all night, mostly just sitting and waiting. We ended up not having a test, which was good, although I was surprisingly prepared for it. I found that I had an easier time understanding the material, although it was harder for me to associate concepts with names.
