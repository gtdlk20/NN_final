Our ways separated and both of us went talking to some other friends. It was after, say, 45 minutes untill the pills kicked in hard. I was a little drunk, but the effects of the MDMA wiped out all the effects of alcohol. My mood lifted immediately and I had the biggest smile on my face I'd ever seen. The music and colour changed from 'nice' to 'superb', and I couldn't resist telling the world I'd taken two pills. Because of the high dosage of MDMA, the speedy effect kicked in. My jaw was clenched, and I couldn't keep it in one position. This was the first thing which annoyed me about the drug.
