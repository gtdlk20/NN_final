As I was nestled in my blankets and ready to shut my eyes, suddenly it felt as thought my eyes were glued open. No matter how hard I tried shutting them they would just slowly split back open. I tossed and turned for probably 3 hours and suddenly started feeling extremely paranoid and I was sweating but was freezing at the same time. By about 6am I could finally feel myself getting a tiny bit tired. For my birthday that year my sister had gotten me a book filled with the art of Camille Rose Garcia (it is very dark and inspired by old Disney esque cartoons). When I shut my eyes I saw the characters from the book I had received and they were all standing on a spiral stair case of some kind and  bending their knees bouncing up and down all in sync while I could hear the song 'puttin on the ritz', but the version covered by this musician from the 80's called Taco. (it's terrifying). For about the next hour this would happen every time I closed my eyes so I was too terrified to sleep. By 9am my entire family had driven to my parents house to throw a big birthday dinner for me. I walked downstairs looking like hell and the site of food made me want to vomit. Best birthday ever!
