I had my classic symptoms of coming up, and about an hour and a half after taking the first pill, pretty significant floating double vision. My friends were really buzzing and where all smiles and pretty touchy feely. But although my vision was off on its own I felt completely straight, not uncomfortable nor any other negative feeling, just straight. We took another pill at 11.30 and I took my last one at 1.30. By then my visuals had more or less stopped and at 3.00 I was feeling pretty tired and went to bed.
