07:00 - The comedown is heavier now. My body feels exhausted and needs rest. Slight nausea from the laxative. To combat this, I lay down and relax. As soon as I relax my body completely, the constipation stops! I realize that it is the stomach tightness from before. I have been unconsciously clenching my stomach muscles for god knows how long, probably since at least 05:00. Wow. This is probably the only negative I have encountered so far.
