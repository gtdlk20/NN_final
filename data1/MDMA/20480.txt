I took 100mg of MDMA after we had dinner. I was dancing, having fun, and waiting for it to kick in. However, I grew impatient after not feeling the effects in an hour and took another 100mg. I started to feel the roll when I was sitting on my friend's lap. I was kissing my friends on the cheek and felt at ease. But, slowly I could feel my heart rate increase and my mind felt out of my control, I felt anxiety about how high I was and if I was safe. I had to take a step outside for fresh air. My friends asked me questions and I felt overwhelmed. I yelled at them 'No more questions.' Next, I started to sing 'Come Together' by the Beatles. I still felt out of control and went inside to lay down on cushions people had placed on the floor. My roommate came to comfort me, and we went to our room. My roommate pulled out some pink ecstasy pills which made me feel uncomfortable. She put half in her beer and drank it.
