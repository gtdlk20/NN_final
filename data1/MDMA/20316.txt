By 1:30 - 2am we were in the car in the parking lot, waiting to leave, and I felt pretty down/depressed.  It almost seemed like the whole night was a distant memory.  And as much as the coming down sucked, the emotions/feelings/sensations I felt that night were definitely worth it.  It's a night I'll never forget.
