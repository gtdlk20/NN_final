After walking what seemed an eternity though these waves of malevolent beings, I come across the tent area. There are thousands of people here and a good portion are camping the whole weekend, so the tent area is really spread out into a tent metropolis. There are tents EVERYWHERE, and I have a head full of some unknown potent psychedelic substance that is tearing my sanity apart, and I am completely lost. I stumbled into a couple of tents hoping that I was in the right tent, but I'm only met with kind strangers looking at me oddly, as oddly as I'm staring back at them, watching their faces continually contort and shift, and yes the mouths are just as menacing as they were earlier. One tent I stumbled in had 3-4 people (that I remember) that seemed to be more or less naked and writhing together, making quite erotic noises. Amazingly they weren't upset, and asked if I would like to join, as another pulled my arm when I tried to leave. Needless to say I was more focused on finding my friends and the safe haven of our tent, then participating in some random orgy with a bunch of strangers, although now it sounds like it may have been quite a bit of fun.
