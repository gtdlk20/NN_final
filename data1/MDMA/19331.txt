All in all, this drug changed my life and made me realize that I could be that happy. My friendships with the other girls who used ecstasy have become some of the most amazing friendships of my life at this point.  For three days after I could still feel the sensation in my chest when I breathed in, it felt beautiful. I had a very nice mood lift for those same three days. Afterwards life returned to normal. I suffered no depression from ecstasy.
