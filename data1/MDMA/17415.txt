I have no idea what made me roll for so long. Maybe I wasnt rolling, and it was all about my attitude. But even two days later, and completely sober, I still feel that sense of happiness and empathy that Ecstasy gave me. The level of bonding and emotional sharing that I felt with near-strangers, let alone friends, was something that is difficult for a sober person to imagine. Ecstasy really is a love drug, and even fully aware of the physical and mental side effects, and the possibility of a severe come down.  I look forward to my next Ecstasy experience, although I am definitely going to wait a while so as to make sure my next roll is just as good as the first.
