As I lay in bed I can feel tingling sensation crawling down my back from my shoulders, then a while later I moved my head and it felt incredibly light as if the force of gravity had been reduced. I then noticed the same sensation in my arm and decidied to get out of bed as I may now be feeling the sensation of the drug.
