We got to the place and another friend (female) was there to meet us. She had high-quality marijuana and we smoked it in the parking lot in the car while waiting for the delivery (about 7:45). I felt a strong 'head-change' and was more aware of the music we were listening to. It was trance (a kind of techno) and all the different patterns were getting noticed in my mind one by one. I sat enjoying this for about 10 minutes. I got my small pill and took it with a gulp of water. I knew we would be off on our adventure, so I prepared myself with a big bottle of water, glow sticks to keep me entertained in the car, and a binky (pacifire) because I tend to get really bad lock-jaw at my peak.
