I've had several experiences with PMA (apparently PDA is a term also used here in Belguim to describe what I think is the same substance). The most recent experience (I think) was at a small party organized by friends of a friend. Earlier that day I'd visited holland for 5gr high potent weed. (only 45min drive and lately it's worth it if I compare the herb's quality to what I'm getting here(Ghent)) by the evening I'd smoked an estimate of 3 joints. I think it's significant to mention that I smoke weed on a daily basis and have been for several years, resulting in a fairly high tolerance of the drug.
