A half hour went by and the water felt amazing. About an hour later we took another roll.  When it was all said and done we took a total of 4.  So we were just enjoying the hot tub when my neighbor said her dog jumped over my wall and her dog couldnÂ’t get back over.  Rolling hard I walked over there and by this time I was freezing and clenching my jaw I had to go put some pants and a robe on. When I came back out the dog and my neighbor was gone.  I started tripping out and getting all paranoid.  This is when it started to get interesting. My house and back yard was pitch black.  So the shadows started playing with my head.
