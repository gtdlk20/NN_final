In conclusing I don't think any drug could have possibly been given a more fitting name...it truely is ecstasy.  Also, the setting really does matter with this drug.  If you take 'e' while with people you don't feel too great around with a bad mood you really do get a pretty so-so trip.  Sure you'll feel happy...but nothing very special..you'll probably have had better times without chemical help.
