For anyone who has raved, this is not an uncommon story. But just recently, I discovered somthing else about E. It can be more than a party tool. I dropped a gel cap of pure mdma (apox 100mg) about a month ago with my best friend from high school. This was his first party and his first time doing e. Ever since I had started partying, I felt as though I saw the world at a different level than Grant. We were drifting apart. But that night was incredible. When Grant started rolling, we became friends again. The tension between our diferences in ideology and lifestyle was gone. This roll wasn't about escape, sex, or addiction, it was about 2 people whose lives had diverged and was bridged by the surreal underground world.
