My sight, hearing, and sense of touch were amplified considerably, yet my nose had nearly no sensation. The slightest touch, tap, or brush of the skin sent surges of cool tingling throughout my body. Anything that moved under the psychedelic lighting grabbed my attention, and I found myself staring at things for long periods of time, lost in rambling thought and kaleidoscopic daydreams. Watching the mirrorball on the ceiling imprisoned my eyes and I locked my gaze on it for a good 10-15 minutes, leaving the rest of my body still as a statue. My train of thought glided from one thing to another. Memories of childhood playgrounds, old girlfriends, and significant events in my life flooded my consciousness as every muscle and nerve seemed to numb and relax. I felt as though I was anticipating a great event soon, but that nothing could disturb my total, complete, engulfing euphoria.
