Never done anything before, hate smoking and dont even drink a lot. I had new years day off work so I was keen for a big night. Been considering pills for quite some time as alcohol makes me tired and I just get rather bored. I like to dance a lot and am pretty outgoing. Got a mates house party of about 30 people, so not a huge crowd.
