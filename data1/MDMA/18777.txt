When we reached the movie theater, after what seemed like forever, we climbed up the 5 or 6 stairs with a very strange feeling passing on each step. I felt like I was getting higher and higher with each step I took, and 'elevating' myself, so to speak, made my head spin, in an exhilarating way, and made my vision jarr a little bit. The movie theater we went to was HUMUNGOUS, and played about 20 movies, so it was made to accomodate a lot of people, which of course meant, that there were unbelievably bright neon lights everywhere. Things started to get a little overwhelming. G and I got our tickets and went inside, and immediately got confused. The lights were extremely disorienting. We handed our tickets to the wrong person, so he pointed us in the other direction. When the ticket-ripper guy recieved us, he gave us this horribly long, insanely complicated sentence about where to go, so we just said, 'Uh, thanks' and walked away, neither of us understanding what he said, so we were left to find the movie on our own.
