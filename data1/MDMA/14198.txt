I took 25 mg each hour during the first 3 hours and 35 mg for the last dose. The come-up each time brought on a short wave of anxiety. I stayed on the sofa with blankets for the entire experience. I listened to meditation music and focused my thoughts on issues I wanted to sort out. I felt best when not moving around at all during the experience. I also felt better with my eyes closed. The last dose of 35 mg rendered me limp after a more intense wave of anxiety. My body stayed limp for about 45 minutes while feeling great mentally. I ate ¼ of a cannabis brownie at approximately 3.5 hours. This sort of ruined the clean comedown for me. Cannabis tends to produce a dirty feel for me, so I will not use it again in combination with anything.
