I came up with alot of theory that I wont get into here, but I found the reasons that I leaned more towards traditional psychedelics, though I did still like the entactogens.  Now I knew why.  MDA lacked most of that feminine aspect as well.  The inner feeling was indescribable.  It wasnt just physical, it was spiritual.
