Now Ive set the scene, lets get down to the fun part  the night in question.  We started the evening getting slightly drunk in the caravan and smoking a few joints.  We then headed down to the village pub where we proceeded to drink some more (Jack Daniels as I remember), and make acquaintance with the local laydeez of the village.  Once closing time came we all headed to a house party just down the road from the pub and somehow managed to blag our way in.  There was talk going round of a geezer hanging around outside selling ecstasy, and my friend and I wasted no time in obtaining some of these pills.  Once we had these pills in our hands we began to get quite apprehensive.  It was to be the first time for both of us but there was no going back now so we downed them and had some cheap wine.  Roughly half an hour later, the effects were getting quite noticeable for me and I had the sudden urge to start dancing like a maniac in the middle of the living room floor of this guys house who I didnt even know.  My friend at this point was in the bathroom doing I dont know what so I went into the garden for some fresh air and a brief sit down.
