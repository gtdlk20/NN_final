We hopped into a yard and went into a shed, we found a can of spray paint, paint thinner, and gasoline and took them.  We came up onto the vocational school in the area and spraypainted ridiculous phrases on the wall.  Sayings that were really only funny to him and I.  We turned the corner of the school as we went to leave the grounds and spotted a police cruiser parked with all of its lights off in the parking lot.  With a bit off fear we hid the gas, spray paint and paint thinner out of view.  We walked around and found the shoreline, I emptied the gasoline can and paint thinner onto the beach which was mostly rocks.  I light the gasoline and it lit up the area and we bolted down the beach.  We wandered through yards and eventually made it to the pier that was our destination.  We sat and talked about personally stuff for about an hour, we talked about what a night it had been and that we were glad we did it.  It was about 5:45-6:00 when we decided to walk back.  The way back was filled with serious talks that bonded the two of us a little more.  We both brang up old memories as we made our way back to my house to sleep.  We got back in around 8:00am. Exhausted and not rolling anymore, we laid down.  Stoner was able to fall asleep right away and slept for about 4-5 hours.   However, I was unable to sleep. I watched movies till stoner woke up in which we got something to eat and just laid around all day.
