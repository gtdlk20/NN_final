The next day I was feeling like shit as usual after MDMA but nothing special, no hallucinations nor hearing weird stuff, what I did was check the flyer for the party and strangely enough, I discovered that one of the features of the crew that played the night before was audial illusion (seriously WTF). One of my previous bad trips led me down in a tent hearing distorted voices that were really spooky and paranoid but that time as I wrote before, I was not the only one. Now I would like to ask if somebody else had similar experience of illusions especially when they are not that high or at a 72h rave.
