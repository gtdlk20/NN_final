So this is my first report of any kind but felt this ROA deemed qualities that deserved to be expressed. I have a fairly good amount of experience with this substance and was looking for something a little stronger. Now, me being completely against using needles, I was searching for info on what the best way to take this substance. Snorting has been my preferred method because of the rush but after researching what was better ORAL or Insuffaltion, I decided that I needed to research rectal administration. Now I have searched the BIOAVAILABILITY of just about every illegal substance known to man and ecery substance seemed to say the same thing: Rectal bioavailability>%80. So this sparked my interest and got me thinking, I wonder 'What kinda info I can find on google about plugging Molly...' So I immediately go to google and search for some experience with this and came up with NADA!
