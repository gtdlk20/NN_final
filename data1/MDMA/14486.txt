1.	I am learning to accept and respect my limits with hard drugs. I have only ever microdosed on hallucinogens and taken small doses of MDMA, because I like to be in control. I assumed, for some uneducated reason, that taking more MDMA would just mean more of the positive feeling. It did not this time. It just meant that it hit me much harder in the initial wave and that peoples vibes (i.e. Mirandas) affected me waaay more than usual. I know now that I should take less or take MDMA in increments.
