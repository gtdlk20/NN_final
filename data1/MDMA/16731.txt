The Molly came as clear capsules with white powder in them.  I do not know the dosage or how many mg of powder was in the capsules, but I assume one cap was intended as one dose.  At my age (28), I know myself and my body and how sensitive I am... I'm a lightweight and drugs tend to have a stronger effect on me than they do on others.  Between this and the fact that my boyfriend had never done MDMA, we decided to split a capsule.  I twisted one open and emptied out the powder onto a clean piece of paper.  I used a credit card to divide the powder into two piles, as even and equal as possible.  I swept one pile off onto a second sheet of paper, for my boyfriend.  Using a crease in each piece of paper, we emptied the powder into our mouths and washed it down with a swig of water.  It tasted AWFUL... very bitter, metallic, burning... impossible to ingest without making a face in disgust, so I see why they put it in a capsule.
