Alright, first off. I've been using speed for most of 2 years. I've tried just about everything thats readily available on the street. One day I'm talking to my friend (D) and he says he can get pink dolphins...So being the curious person I am I said hook it up, so his friend talked to me and I met him somewhere and picked up 2 pills. Got home took one and waited...then I cut some of the other pill and cut it up and snorted it..then decided to just eat it....After that it was shower time..I felt a little wierd but nothing specific..then I got out of the shower and noticed everything seemed very clear and warm...I went out to have a cigarette and thats when the fun began...life was just pouring into me, I could taste,smell,feel,hear and touch everything good in life. I finished my cig and went inside....everything felt fake,like I was dreaming..I never expected it to be like this. I played some guitar and I could feel the music, like the guitar was part of me, and it almost became too intense. Overall I feel one with the world...life is vivid and full...the world is my oyster and I'm about to slurp that sucker down
