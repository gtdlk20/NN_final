Not in a particularly socializing mood, I felt more up for listening to some more music on the dancefloor (Electronic/IDM)  However I never did have a lot of stamina for dancing, so I decided to sit and watch the crowd and enjoy the music. It was then that I made the conscious decision to rave from where I was seated  I could headbang and use my hands all whilst sitting down. This was not a product of the MDMA, but rather the afterglow of the positive experience. I thought to myself that this is what whirl-y-gig is all about  It doesnt matter what I do or how I do it  as long as I'm enjoying myself. A concept I noticed that wasnt present on the dance floor.
