The body rushes were so insane at one point that i had to sit down and just watch.. i could definitly not drive in this state. Everything, looked crisp and defined.. my voice seemed to come from deep within me.. I had a bit difficulty talking, as in forming the words that i wanted to say.. After this flooring rush wore off, the speedy effects came on, and i danced my ass off, with the glowsticks.. I didnt care if I looked like an ass.. In threat to my ego became non existent..
