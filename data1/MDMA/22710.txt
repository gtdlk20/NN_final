The amazing part of the trip lasted from 2.5 hours in to 4 hours after that. I have a bad habit when I'm on ecstasy. I love to sit in the bath. I of course make the water very hot but I open the window and stand up to cool off very frequently. CG and I decided to hit the bath. My apartment at the time had an enormous bath tub. We sat in the tub together as if it were totally normal smoking our cigarettes and talking about our respective love lives. When all of a sudden I looked towards CG. Half his face was shaded. As I stared into the dark half of his face it all of a sudden leaped towards me and started to morph into some huge purple monster/demon face. I started laughing histerically despite my fear. CG started asking me what was the matter. I threw myself towards him and hugged him so I could no longer see his face and told him simply that 'He was a monster'.
