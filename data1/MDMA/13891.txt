I informed Jean-Ralphio that I had taken a lot of MDMA with a dopey smile draped across my face.  I assure him I am feeling fine before I lie back down  on my bed and close my eyes.  No visual effects are present but I return to a trance-like state almost immediately.  My mind is unusually calm and thoughts flow through my mental space at a manageable pace.  In fact they float into my mind at a relatively slow tempo, slower than when I am sober.  Topics of thought are unfocused and not particularly noteworthy.  No revelations are arrived at.
