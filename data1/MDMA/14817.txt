2:45ish -  I couldnt really say when I noticed the 3rd and a half pill hit. After I smoked the weed it scattered my mind. If youve ever smoked weed and found the drifting in and out of thought then youll know what Im talking about. On E, it does the same thing except my thoughts are far more intense and lightning fast. So those stoner thoughts I have drift into my mind, are recognized, and passed on in record speed. There were a few scenes I remember at this point. I was standing next to the bed talking/thinking about the lady who asked if I was cumming. And I seemingly pulled information out of nowhere and I came to the conclusion that cumming and being on E are the same thing; that when you are cumming you are experiencing the same serotonin release that is experienced on E. (Later I found the facts to be a little different.)
