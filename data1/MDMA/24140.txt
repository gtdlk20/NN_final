It was about seven in the morning and already 90 degrees and we had parted ways with our friends after they were kind enough to drop us off at our car. (We would have never found it on our own.) My buddy was still rolling hard, but I was in the 'death' phase...unable to sleep, frightened, and seeing still objects breathing.  I just wanted to get the hell out of dodge!!!
