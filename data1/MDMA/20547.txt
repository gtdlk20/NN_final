I enjoyed the rest of the concert, and the rest of the evening.  I could not stop smiling the rest of the night.  I couldn't have, even if I tried.  The spill on the venue floor was a little scary, but I got over it.  The reason for that I think was that I had not eaten a bite since breakfast, almost 12 hours ago and hadn't really had any water that day.  Maybe if I had had some food, it would not have rushed right through my system and slammed me into this brick wall of euphoria.  As good as it was, there was too much pleasure crammed into too small an amount of time; so much so that I lost control of my physical body.  Overall it was an unbelievable experience.  I don't know if I'll do it again, but if I do, I know I will enjoy it.
