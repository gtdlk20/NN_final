When I woke the following day at 3 am (E was out of town at this point) I felt very weird in a general way. I was very dizzy and had an acute lack of balance. Id had difficulty going to sleep the night before, experiencing uncontrollable twitching every few seconds as well as auditory hallucinations of a crowd of people and music that grew louder until they were deafening and I was forced to sit up (whereupon they vanished). Within an hour of waking Id begun feeling actively bad, and for several hours I had a racing heart, was trembling very noticeably, had impaired motor control, was very nauseous with mild lock-jaw-type symptoms, and felt a sense of encroaching dread. I tried to calm myself, but after a while I became increasingly convinced that I was going to have a heart attack and die, as my heart rate went through the roof despite my lying down and performing breathing exercises. I didnt know what to do, so I called E and woke him up and told him about my symptoms. This had a slight calming effect, and I was able to lie down and read while he went back to sleep.
