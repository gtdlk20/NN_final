James and Sarah while they don't fight or anything, aren't friends with each other as well as being brother and sister. They dont hang out often, and generally don't know each other as friends.  My goal for the experience was to let them both see why I am friends with the other, and thus become friends with each other.  I thought that it would be lovely for them too be friends, for them, for their family, and also for me.
