The next day I was extremely tired and just wanted to lie in bed all day. Occasionally I would get another headache in the center of my head. Unlike the previous times Ive taken ecstasy, the worst days were 3 to 4 days later. I just felt super depressed, and it wasnt one of those feelings you could just snap out of. I also had a short fuse and would get angry at things pretty quickly. Its been a week now and Im finally feeling normal and happy again. But the comedown and after of this experience were by far the worst Ive had.
