I did not really have a question, per se, but I wanted to give you some information that might be helpful.  I have had many experiences with pure MDMA.  One thing that I have noticed is that if you take 100mg doses about 2.5 h apart, and you do this three times, by the time the third one hits you you are hallucinating.  I did not think that MDMA was like this.  In fact, I have also done pure LSD and mescaline and I have never seen stuff like I do with this MDMA experience.  LSD and mescaline give color shifts and trails.  I was actually seeing things on dose 3 of MDMA.  People walking by that were not there, faces change from the person I knew into someone else.  Do you guys have an explanation for this?
