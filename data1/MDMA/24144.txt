Home...finally got there and went straight to the shower.  It didn't do me any good.  I tried to lay in bed, but there was no way I was going to sleep.  All I could think about were the horrible images I saw all night and day...restless as hell.  I remembered that I promised to call my girlfriend to tell her I was home safely, but when I called I got her mom instead.  Out of nowhere, she starts yelling (mind you..I'm still fucked up in the head from the trip) at me about finding out from my girfriend that I do GHB and such...that she's going to call the cops and tell my mother if I ever speak to her daughter again.  One can imagine the thoughts that went through my mind for the rest of the day, night, and the next day without any sleep.  I wanted to cry, but wouldn't let myself...I was just glad to be alive and home.
