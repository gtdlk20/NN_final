Once we got in the car, I told him to close his eyes, and I led him into a fantasy world. I told him to picture a lake in the brightest time of the day, with the water a golden color reflecting the sun's rays. Although he should have been my guide, I became his. All of a sudden I was the E expert. Any questions he had I had an answer for, it was like I had memorized word for word everything I had ever read about this drug. We talked about all things, I started telling him about my life in great detail, things were coming out that I had never told another living soul. Nothing but truth and confession. I had held so many things in for so long, and it was like MDMA helped me push through this giant wall. Once everything was out, I felt such a tremendous amount of freedom, I felt reborn. I was looking at the world with a whole new perspective, everything held so much beauty and amazement for me. I sang and it was so beautiful. He told me all about his life in great detail also, and I understood everything. I was like a new born baby, completely innocent and full of hope and new prespective.
