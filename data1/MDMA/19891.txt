All of a sudden, I didn't know where I was. This lasted about 10 seconds, and then my next memory is of being in another corner of the rave. This again lasted about 10 seconds. I remember walking across an empty space, but can't remember why. I think I was going to get water. Once again, only a 10 second block that all I can recall is pure euphoria. Even now I get tingles remembering it.
