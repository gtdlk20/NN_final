The music and lights glowed friends crowed my brother as he span. Sebra and I danced together like no one was watching. All this was fun oh sure except that I was certain that while Sebra was in her high I was not. It was now 2am and I had not felt anymore different than that of 2 hrs ago. I began to become disappointed and the party was becoming more and more crowded. There had been another party that same night that was crashed; the remaining partygoers were coming to the one I was at.
