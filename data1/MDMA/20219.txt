I'm not saying an MDMA experience can't be something to enjoy. I made a big mistake not knowing what I'd taken (I'd only heard about XTC as a party drug, like alcohol or speed) and how much I'd take. I completely underestimated MDMA I completely underestimated MDMA and this report might be read as a bad trip report. Either way, I won't do it again.
