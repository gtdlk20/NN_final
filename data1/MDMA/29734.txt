I have used MDMA before three times, though it was three years ago, and I never really saw it for what it is, or even understood it because of my love for traditional psychedelics.  It was quite a change, and I was expecting it to cause a trip, but with more of a feeling of comfort in the body and mind.  I never got any visuals, though I did feel awesome.  It never changed me like Peyote, Psilocybe mushrooms, Morning Glory, LSD, and such has.
