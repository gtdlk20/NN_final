I may roll again, if I can be assured of the quality of the MDMA, but I have seen some of my friends mildly fried from too much ecstasy. The question of neurotoxicity is not well enough researched and possible damaging consequences may rule out my desire for future experimentation. I must admit, aside from my current uncertainty, this night was probably the most fun I have ever had.
