Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] Boyfriend feels fine to drive and so we leave.  We end up driving around our new town (we moved here about a week ago) for quite a while... boyfriend literally 'projectile vomits' on our way back home.  This is for some reason incredibly amusing to us. Boyfriend takes hit number three... things go quite hazy from here.
