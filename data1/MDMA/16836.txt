So did ecstasy repair our broken relationship? The answer is, perhaps predictably, Yes and No. We eventually divorced, but only after months of trying and, now and again, succeeding.

But at least when we finally did split, we were to some degree prepared.  The tangible benefits of ecstasy didn't last, and The Problem hadn't gone away.

We had begun to grow in the ways that would allow each of us to embrace new lives, loves and adventures  for ourselves, and for the other.
