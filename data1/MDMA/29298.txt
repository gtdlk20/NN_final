While on MDMA, subject was speaking in drawn out questions and also cared about MY experience:'Is everything OKaaaaaay? Where are you goinnnnnggg?' --and this was in response to me getting up to use the bathroom. Maybe this suggests some anxiety on her part, but I couldn't help but think I had some fault in this because I didn't know how to react to someone rolling and if I should laugh or actually help her understand.  Now I wish I did the latter.
