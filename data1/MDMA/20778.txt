Empathy is a big part of the feeling I get from MDMA. My relationship with my girlfriend post-roll is a little different now. Rolling with her was an amazing thing, and I have a whole new insight into the kind of person she is. I have realized how people need to be treated with kindness and above all, understanding, if there is to be harmony.
