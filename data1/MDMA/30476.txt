For some reason I was soo happy to see these people we barely knew, I was over social with them and I think they thought I was crazy. But we ended up spending alot of time with them. We got to know each other alot amd talked about our views of life and what was going on in the world. It was such an in debth conversation, all these feeling arouse out of nowhere, like me ego was stripped completely away from me, which was in a way, a very good thing. It allowed me to be honest, sympathetic, caring, and loving to everybody I met, and thats how I wanted to be able to feel without the drug. Finally the time came where I had to go home, my friends pill was wearin off and mine was somewhat also, but I was rolling harder than him, considering it was my first time and not his. So now its almost 11 and I get home. I go to my room and put on some music and sit and think about what I learned about myself and other people from the wonderful expeirience I had just lived through. Its over a year later now, and I have had zillions of other kinds of expeiriences with tons of different substances, but that night is still one of or maybe the most memorable and meaning night I have ever had. I recommend pure ecstasy for anyone trying to find there inner feelings on life and the people aroudn them.
