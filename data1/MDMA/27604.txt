I remember vividly how my first hit of E felt. I was scared to death to take it, thinking it would feel similar to LSD. I had stopped taking acid due to unpleasant trips. After finally popping my first tab, my friend and I went driving. I couldn't believe how good I felt when it started to kick in. It was amazing. I couldn't believe that my body and mind could feel so much intense euphoria and pleasure. Such a surge, wave of swishing pleasurable air rushing up to my face, filled with such amazing fluffiness. I felt as if I were floating, while uncontrollably smiling and moaning. I couldn't stop saying, 'Wow....'.
