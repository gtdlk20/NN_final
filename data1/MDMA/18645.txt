Of course some of my friends stole the pen and my sketchbook every once and a while as well to write and draw on other pages, at those times I tried so hard not to draw but the urge was so strong I often needed to tell them to give it back to me so I could draw. But of course that made me feel like a bad person, I was trying to be as generous as possible and it wasn't working when I displayed behaviour like that.
