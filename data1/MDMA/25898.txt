First some background... About five years ago I was in an automobile accident that resulted in a stroke, which altered brain function in my right occipital lobe, who knows where else, physically manifesting itself as numbness on my left side, a not very coordinated left arm (due to spontaneous tremors) and a visual blind spot covering most of the upper left hemisphere of my sight.
