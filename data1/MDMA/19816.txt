The guys kept saying, take it now, take it now.  I wanted to wait a bit longer so I would peak around 12, not knowing for sure how long the experience would last.  I gave into their convincing tone and knocked it back with some warm coke.  I sat back in my seat, waiting for something to happen.  Half an hour later I had to go, I trekked over to the toilet and did my business.  On the way back I felt something, nothing major but a definite sign my pill was kicking in.  I sat back down, several friends asked me, is it working yet.  At this moment my head started to pulse and I needed a drink, not alcohol, that cant be good.  I sat in my seat looking around at my friends, a warm feeling had come over me, me vision was unsettled and I felt great.  Ecstasy was happening and so far it was the best experience of my life, little did I know it was about to get better and better.
