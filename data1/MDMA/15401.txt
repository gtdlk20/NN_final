On my long flight home I buried myself in a book, and when I got home and my luggage didn't make it, I just asked the airline to deliver it.  When they did, the following day, I opened my suitcase to find that several of my belongings, about $700 of my belongings, had been stolen.  I got furious.  I called every number I could, getting more and more frustrated.  I went on a long walk to try to calm down.  When I came home, I started crying.  I was so upset that someone had taken my stuff that it made me doubt everything and everyone in my life.  Over the course of the next few days, I wrote in my journal, I walked and walked, and yet I could not shake this horrible feeling that life sucked and everything was pointless.
