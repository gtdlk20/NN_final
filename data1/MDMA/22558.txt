We began our trip and I noticed I was feeling even better, I began smoking cigarettes non-stop. I believe we finished the pack of 20 within an hour.  We walked down alleys picking up poles spinning them, we hopped in yards and jumped on a trampoline.  I had the overwhelming urge to run, and we did, we sprinted and it was amazing it was as if all my muscles worked to their full capacity. Even with a cigarette in my mouth I was able to breath so smoothly and not get tired. I randomly tried to slam dunk on Basketball nets that loomed in the alley, we hurdled trash cans and finally stopped at this garage.  I decided that I was going to climb on its' roof.  We got on the roof and just laid on it letting our feet hang off.  The slanting of the roof and gravity felt very very good. Within minutes I decided to light up another cigarette and jump off the roof.  We continued down the alley randomly sprinting here and there.  Somewhere along the line I got the feeling that I had super strength, and decided to pull a 'Slow, Children At Play' sign out of the ground.  I did it with ease and felt extremely positive about myself. The walk was filled with praise from both of us, I contiually high-fived stoner for endorsing this night.  The alley ended into a road that had a turn closed for construction, and we stopped to play around on the construction equipment.  We both had a mischievous streak and decided we would put cones across the road to see if people were smart enough to get out and move them.  We waited in the grass as car after car approached the cones, some skidding, and turning around.  We found some paint and painted random sayings into the dirt, and then we placed a the road closed sign from the closed street onto the high way which only was separated from the residential street by a jersey wall.  We continued walking to our destination after that but stopped to bang on a door and run.
