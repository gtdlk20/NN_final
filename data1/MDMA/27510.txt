Sadly, all good things must come to an end and M's mother was kicking us out of the house. My dad came to pick up me, A, and P and I was still rolling, but was coming down again and it was easy to control. He probably just thought I was really drunk. When we got home I listened to some music and drifted off into heavenly drug induced slumber.
