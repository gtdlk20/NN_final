To be fucking honest, this pill saved my life. I had the most spiritual trip I've ever had on any drug. I listened to radiohead all night and thought about my actions. I wrote and thought and wrote and thought and wrote and analyzed myself for 6 hours. I came to the conclusion that happiness cannot come from anywhere but yourself, or else it's not true happiness. I could not find happiness inside of H. And H did not love me anymore because I was not myself. I was a turd wallowing in mental agony. And by mental agony, I mean rocking myself to sleep in the fetal position, humming children's playground songs to try to make myself unsad. I did this almost every night. When I found out where I could find my happy place, I was reborn. I shed out of this skin and became a changed person. This is why I quit pot. It is too apathetic and I cant stand being that person anymore. At 4 in the morning on this X trip, I called up H, after 3 weeks of silence and even longer without a decent conversation. I told her about my epiphany and I opened up again.
