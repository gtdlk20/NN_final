I felt chilled and just wanted to sit very still on the sofa. The colors of the golf course were vibrant (the view from my living room) and everything seemed nice as long as I remained very still. Any movement on my part incited light waves of nausea, but no feeling of a need to vomit. The most comfortable position was lying on the floor curled up in a blanket. I felt cold the entire time. House temp was 74 degrees. The experience was very pleasant and introspective, but not euphoric. It lasted a total of 3 hours. I didnÂ’t notice any come down effects the next day.
