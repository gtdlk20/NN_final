A peculiar thing about this point of the night: when I was thinking about these ideas I found that my mind was so scattered and intense that I could not tell the difference between thinking something and actually saying it. I realized it as I was standing next to the bed C was on. I would catch myself saying fragments of sentences at record speed: andsothatswhatitmeansto-(drift) Itotallyunderstandwhatshemeantbycumming!(drift) it'sfuckingincredible(drift). Etc. I realized what I was doing and called myself out on it, and was mystified by it, and then continued to think about that. After trying to explain to C what was happening she kind of just looked at me and was like What are you talking about? Come lay down with me! I immediately obliged.
