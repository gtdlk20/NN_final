My friend Holly has been going through an extremely difficult time in her life. She's 19, mother to a 3-month old girl, and living with her parents after leaving the baby's father. We hadn't talked in nearly 2 years at this point, her ex having told her she couldn't talk to any other guys, and by the time of this session we had only been talking again for maybe 2 weeks. Holly is a beautiful young woman and I remembered seeing her once at a rave so I felt obligated to tell her about MDMA psychotherapy. We discussed it and once I let her know I was comfortable with playing the role of therapist she told me she wanted to give it a shot. We decided on doing it a few days after Halloween while her baby was with the father. I obtained 300 mgs of molly, 150 mgs each, which I reagent tested and knew was extremely pure, and on Nov. 2nd picked her up right before midnight. At this point, our adventurous night together began.
