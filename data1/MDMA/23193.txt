We all moved off and some time later I felt light headed. I was sharing a chair with a friend who was peaking. I nearly fell off the chair. I stumbled turned around and I had the biggest smile in the world. I tried to communicate with words but I couldn't. I would be short of breath every second word. This was a new feeling I had not felt before and I looked at my friends and they stared back at me with smiles as they nodded in agreement. They knew exactly what I was feeling and they asked the retorical question 'You feeling ok man?'. I just shook their hands as I grinned at them. Then I nodded my head. For once again we were brothers.
