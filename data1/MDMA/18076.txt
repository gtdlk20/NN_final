I don't suggest anyone try to mimic this because I honestly have no clue if it was a healthy thing to do. To this day I've never tried to do that again, but have had less than equal experiences with opiates and sleeping. I don't think anything can quite compare to waking up and already be peaking on some really good ecstacy.
