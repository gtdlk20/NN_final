+1:40. While driving down the canyon, Holly began talking about how her and her ex first met. Immediately, I turned the radio off and listened intently. They met during her senior year in high school, at a time where she partied a lot and was with a lot of different guys. As the story went on, I came to learn just how much this guy did for her, supporting her through an alcohol problem and staying with her despite being cheated on several times. At the time, she didn't really know how bad it hurt him when she cheated, a fact she'd told me on several occasions, and over time she stopped cheating and learned how to be in a relationship. She became pregnant, and though adoption was discussed they chose to keep the baby.
