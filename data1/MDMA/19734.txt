T+ 1:00  After I hang up, it soon becomes apparent that I am only getting higher. This is about when I experience my 3 minutes of terror. The ecstasy is taking over my body and I cant do anything about it. It switches from giving me unbelievable excitement and euphoria to overwhelming confusion and fear. My heart is pounding so fast that I can hardly sit up. I try to breathe because I believe that I will die if I dont concentrate on breathing. My thoughts are getting less and less clear and my body is being pummelled by wave after wave of adrenaline. And the strangest part about this moment is that it is distinctly familiar, even though I have never experienced it before. It feels as if I am in a flashback to a past life, and even in terror, for a second I feel safer than I have ever felt before.
