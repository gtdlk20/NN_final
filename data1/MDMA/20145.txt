I hopped the fence into the outfield and realized how high I could jump, and how fast I was.  I ran around the outfield for a few minutes. I felt like I was just floating really fast, hovering above the ground.  I couldnt even tell that I still had legs, I was so god damn fast. Everything passed me by as if I were traveling 100 mph.  When I jumped, I felt like I had just jumped on the moon, and the gravity was lessened. I seemed to jump 3 times higher than normal.
