As we did it more and more (about every 6-8 weeks), we had to take more and more.  The effects weren't as wonderful as the first time though.  Therefore, some people may say it loses its affect the more you take it.  That is what happened to me.  I just couldn't take it anymore.  I had my fun with it and that was it.  I noticed though that after I stopped taking it I had become depressed.  I was even on anti-depressants for 6 months.  It doesn't effect everyone the same way.  My husband still gets that old time feeling every time he takes it.  Though he doesn't take it anymore because I don't.  If we were to do it again, he would feel as though it were the first time.  So, if you take it, know your limits and if you do get depressed, it is best to go see your doctor and be honest with them!  If they dont' know what you have taken, they can't help you.
