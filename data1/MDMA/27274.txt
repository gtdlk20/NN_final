We got back to the car, got out sleeping bags from the back (I realized any kind of blanket is a necessity.), pushed the two front chairs forward as far as they could go so we could stretch our legs out, and then just sat the back of the car together listened to some great chill music (Boards of Canada, and a few others), smoked lots of weed (another necessity), and just talked.  We talked about many things, many problems we've been having, talked about many experiences we've, just about many things that we would not normally casually talk about.  We drank powerades that we bought at a convience store and also from large bottles of water that we had brought (also a necessity).  Outside the window the raindrops sliding down the glass were beautiful.  Hours flew by.  We stayed in the car for almost four hours.  We decided to leave (it was dark at the time, probably around 5 or 6) and head back home.  After all, this night was not yet over.
