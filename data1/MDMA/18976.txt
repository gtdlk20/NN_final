Friday Night, Sarah and James and I had plans to roll, I had brought 5 pills with me back from school.  They are 'Blue Doves' and are the best pills anyone I know has ever tried.  We were going to do them in my room while my parents were asleep.  However, about two hours before we planned to meet up I called Sarah to confirm.  She was over at her boyfriend's house and was rather drunk.  His house is an extremely chill one, he is away at college but his friends go to community college around here and they hang out at his house primarily.  His parents don't care about drug use or smoking cigs in the house, considering that they both do both.  This is also the most loving, accepting, and well grounded group of people I have ever met.  So me and James come over to Jen's house, because she can't come to us, and also because we can smoke in the house, and when I roll I smoke alot of cigarrettes.
