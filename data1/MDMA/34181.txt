First off, whoever invented this shit--you one helluva person! My very first experience gave me the best feeling I had ever had in my life. I made sure I was prepared, so I asked friends who had done this before, and got a lot of advice. Number 1 thing---either get a whole lot of gum and/or a pacifier. You're gonna be chewing on ur gums right until you come down. Second--make sure ur around people you know, and have plenty of water. This shit makes u wanna drink a lot of water [and can also dehydrate people, so it's important to drink some water throughout the evening]. Most importantly, before you roll--do NOT eat, you will seriously get sick all over the place, and if you do get sick, you'll think its the roll and you'll never wanna do it again, when in actual fact ur missing out the best kinda drug there is!
