People looked so good to me at this time.  I saw a guy sitting behind me who I didn't know, his head in his hands, and all I thought at the time was that this person was my E brother, he had the same dizziness I felt.  Eventually I got enough energy to get back into the crowd.  I found my friend who rolled with me that night.  'How you feeling,' I asked.  He said 'absolutely great'.  'Me too' I replied, 'me too.'
