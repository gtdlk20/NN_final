There were really no preparations made. I showed up at my friends house around 7:30, and we drove to get the Molly, which came in the form of white powder. We came back, I did one line at about 8:00. Felt my first effects at around 8:05. Yes, it hit that fast. I was peaking at about 8:10. Everything was okay, that's how everything around me felt. Love and acceptance of everyone is what I felt. The people I was with and the place I was at, nothing was bad and all the energy I felt was positive. I felt the full effects for around 2 and a half hours and during that time, I was more aware of my body and how things felt around me.
