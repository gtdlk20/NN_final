When we got to the mall, I stopped driving as I was starting to get severely impaired. It was about 3 hour since we initially dosed and we decided to take the other 2 pills each. It was the perfect night out and J and I were having a blast. The moon and stars had just come out. All of a sudden J lifts his arms in the air and starts saying the puppet master had him. Apparently, someone in the sky had strings attached to his arms and was pulling them around. He asked me to tell the puppet master to let him go. I did and his arms dropped. Neither of us could see the puppet master, but we both beleive whole-heartedly that he was there, pulling on invisable strings. The puppet master snagged me a couple of times too, yanking my arms in the air. Everytime J would either tell him to let go or cut the strings. We spent the rest of our time at an awsome bar at the mall, enjoying the trip. When we went home later both of slept fine that night, but the next day I discovered I had been grinding my teeth and biting my tongue alot. Both were VERY sore.
