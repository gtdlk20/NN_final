I walked down by the old lighthouse near the Yacht club and walked out almost all the way. There was what I believe to be a skunk that I noticed scurrying away ahead of me. It didn't bother me, and I kept walking. After a while, I saw the small dark figure coming back toward me, and it kind of freaked me out. Instead of let it get to me, I just turned around and walked back toward the bike path.
