2:00ish: Infected Mushroom ends and me and C get up and head back to coat check very fast. We didnt care about the encore; we wanted to get back to our room. We stood on the steep staircase to coat check, trying to avoid eye contact with the other satisfied fans. However, a lady in front of us was talking to a man behind us. It was awkward. She then turned to us and asked if he could come in front with her, and of course we let him go. As we got to the top, I looked through the little window and saw that there was just a giant rack of coats. Startled, I announced aloud to C: Wait! Is this coatcheck!? I gotta go to bag check!! the lady who asked us earlier if her husband could go in front then said oh no, I think they do that here too. I was relieved but at this point she had seen my eyes clearly. After a moment she turned to me, looked at me very intently, and said: Hey...are you cumming right now? I thought she meant like coming up to the bag check window or something. Bewildered, I looked at C, who had the same bewildered look that I did. I turned back to the lady who clarified: No, no, like CUMMING. Are you CUMMING right now? she completed the statement while gesturing masturbation. My bewilderment simply became more intense. Her husband nudged her and said, knock it off, haha, just leave em alone. Little did I know that the ladys statement would stay with me the rest of the night to the point of obsession. I got my bag and we headed back to the room.
