It is beautiful, tactile senses in general are also more amplified then before. Once again, the concept of air comes back to me. The simple and slight cooling from the ceiling fan are calming and seem to, quite literally ooze and slide off of my body and bare skin like thin layers of water. It is very relaxing and tranquil, but my brother prompts me to come outside with him for a cheap cigar smoke. I'm also looking forward to viewing the stars and feeling the grass outside on this chilling December night, which has been warmed and softly consoled by this beautiful and now significantly... fuck it, fairly highly intensified influence which I presume is a result of the bastardly lines.
