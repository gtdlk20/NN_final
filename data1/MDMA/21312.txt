Ecstasy:  my drug of choice.   Does anyone forget their first glowing experience?   Does anyone ever stop desiring that elusive magic?   After a couple of mind-blowing, spirit-awakening X experiences, my wife and I became semi-regular users.    Never rolling more than twice a month, but also rarely going more than three months without a use.   Unfortunately, we both noticed the same phenomena:  within a year or two, each progressive use of the drug provided less of an emotionally positive push, but retained all the negative side-effects.
