My two best friends wanted me to experience E for the first time, and they said that I would have no better experience than to do it with them. We planned it out a couple days in advance to do it on New Years eve in the afternoon.  We decided we would drive up into the mountains and hike while rolling.  We parked at a hiking spot, the weather was very cold, but the landscape was beautiful.
