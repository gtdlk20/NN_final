Anyway, for the experience in question. First time trying MDMA rectally. 100mg was dissolved in sterile water, put in a dropper syringe, and inserted rectally. Within 20 minutes, I found that my headspace and significantly altered: I was suddenly, yet smoothly pulled to the peak experience that usually happens to me about 1 hour after oral administration. The ramp up, unlike with the oral ingestion, was completely smooth: a clean transition, with none of the usual bumpiness I often associate with MDMA coming on. I also seemed to come down much faster, but again, quite smoothly, and I found the the ecstatic rush was over within an hour and a half or so, even though I had an afterglow that lasted for a few hours.
