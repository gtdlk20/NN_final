half an hour and I'm pretty much to the peak. I was tryin to talk online but couldn't keep my vision straight, everyone I talked to, I felt this great love for...people I've never even met.  It was difficult to read the screen, but my typing was faster than I've ever seen it.  My cat started meowin outside, which reminded me to go smoke a cig and enjoy the fresh air.  The air felt so great when I stepped outside, I sat down and smoked a cigarette.  My cat jumped up on my lap and it felt like a...squishy piece of meat...thats the best words I can think of to describe it, it was strange so I put him down on the ground, and watched him run towards the front of the house.  I seemed to find it very amusing just observing the cat.
