The cool rain falling on my face was one of the most amazing things I've ever felt.  We decided it was time to go back to the car, before it started to rain too hard.  On the way back, I happily talked about experiences I had while in Japan with my friend (who was present and rolling with me too).  Just recalling the simplest of memories was amazing and a complete joy. recalling the simplest of memories was amazing and a complete joy.
