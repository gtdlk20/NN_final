Back at the apartment it all falls to pieces.  I have come down enough to be too awake to fall asleep.  I need to go operate a ski lift for 8 hours in the cold in less then 3 hours.  I haven't slept in 24 hours.  I am watching the ceiling ripple.  The goth I brought back to the apartment is a social retard.  I am embarassed by him and I want him to leave.  My compassion is ebbing.  Various powders are passed around.  I decline.  The goth partakes, although he is new to them.  Fool.  He isn't safe here.  There is no one to look after him.  He is among strangers taking drugs he has no experience with.  Eventually I walk him to the elevator and the doors close.  I never see him again.
