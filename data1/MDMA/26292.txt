+2:00 we walk out of the store, and bust out in laughter. I grab Ds hand and we set off back for my house talking about how funny it is that the lady was talking to us about the evils of getting high, as we were coming up on a much more seriously mind altering substance. We talked about why people need to get more open minded about drugs, and not quite so judgmental. Then we were talking about how beautiful the night sky was. It was so clear and the stars were so bright it was breathtaking. On the walk home I turned on some techno music because it just felt right, but I had it on low on my cellphone because it was really late and I didnt want to disturb the neighbors.
