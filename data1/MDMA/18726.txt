We came together. It was as if we'd made the decision to do so and then just executed that plan simply and purely. It was beautiful and extremely pleasurable without being lustful or too intense. Afterwards, we lie in bed for what felt like hours, just holding each other and kissing. This was an unusual sort of post-coital cuddling, in that I didn't feel the typical desire to have my own greedy need for affection sated, rather, I wanted only to make *him* feel good.
