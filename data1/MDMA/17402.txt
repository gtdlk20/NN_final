Also, I discovered the reason why getting Ecstasy is called rolling: the entirety of the roll was composed of waves of pleasure. The first wave was pretty mild, and was followed by several minutes of relative sobriety. The second wave was more noticeable and followed a few minutes later by a less intense version of the same good feeling. The entire night consisted of increasingly intense waves of pleasure until after the peak, where the trend reversed somewhat: the waves of pleasure were still intense and felt very good, but they got weaker in intensity from then on.
