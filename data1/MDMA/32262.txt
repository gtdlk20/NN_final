It was about 8 o clock on a saturday night when I first took the pill. I was sitting in my friends room with friends play video games, chilling listening to music with blacklights and neon lights everywhere.  About a half hour passed and I didnt feel much different but I could tell it was coming.  About 9 o clock, it hits me hard, and I'm just sitting there listening to music and chilling.  I was the only one rolling so when everyone noticed me there were laughing and I just wanted to hug them all.  I started feeling like my friends were the best thing to ever happen to me.  About 10 minutes after it hits me,  we deicided to walk to the next town over and hang out with some kids.  So I got my Ipod. And started riding my bike.
