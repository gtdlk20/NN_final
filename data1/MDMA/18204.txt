For 2 solid hours I truly expressed my love for electronic music  Something that is impossible with words and verbal communication. My love for it goes much deeper than that. And so I expressed it through attitude, energy and body language. I took those 2 hours of self-esteem with me, back home, and the next day too. In fact I took a great deal from the whirl-y-gig experience, to which I can now apply to future endeavors.
