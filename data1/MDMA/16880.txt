My first experience with E was by accident. I got it from a transfer student during my last year of high school. I did not anticipate anything special from taking it. After doing 'some' research, I thought it will give me some nice visuals so I would be able to take my mind off things. I took one pill that March night, when winter was still in the air, sitting calmly on my bed, watching the city lights, and listening to some cheesy trance music. I was afraid, everything I read on the net screamed 'DONT take it!, you'll get hot and you'll die', I was frankly, paranoid. I tried dancing a little, but that was not what my body really wanted, it seemed fake. I could feel a little bit tipsy,....., but nothing besides that. I recon now, that it may have been caused by paranoia,.....or solitude that I had gotten so used to.
