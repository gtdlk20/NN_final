My ex-boyfriend had also attended the rave, and he found me outside smoking.  And despite all of the euphoria I was feeling, all of the love I had for every being outside in the sprinkles of rain with me, he was the one person who scared me.  His eyes were horrifying.  Just looking into them made me sick to my stomach.  His pupils were dilated, and the pools of black began to swirl as I stared into them, flickering green and yellow and white-- conveying to me a sense of evil.  I managed to suck in another drag of my cigarette, but it caused me to retch.  On the verge of puking, I flicked the cherry off of my cigarette and saved it for later.
