The high faded very, very gently, almost so gradually I that I wasnt aware of it leaving, only the progressive onset of sleepiness. For several hours we had been grinding our teeth constantly and had ruined a couple of Es cards with toothmarks. In all, the trip lasted around 8 hours over 1 gram split between two people. We climbed into bed and slept a while, got up and had some food, then slept a few more hours. I felt the afterglow the entire next day, and was filled with new optimism and felt a dramatically closer bond with E. Physiologically, I hadnt regained much appetite and was still very shaky.
