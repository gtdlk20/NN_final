Saturday afternoon comes and I had asked both girls to read exactly what MDMA does and how it works. So I show up with a scale, and some crystal mdma that I got through the older sister.  A little background on myself.  I am a typical suburban working mom, happily married, 70,000+ salary so you all know I'm just an average mom. I went through my teenage years in the early 80's in a small coastal town in Florida so my background is a lot of smoking weed, starting at age 14, some shrooms, some acid, mdma in the late 80's, cocaine (which is a horrible overpriced drug for anyone that wants to try it, just don't).  As a matter of fact I did MDMA so much, I thought I lost the magic forever. I haven't done it since the late 80's. I did MDMA so much, I thought I lost the magic forever. I haven't done it since the late 80's.  So about 18+ years ago, I guess.  I actually took a break from all drugs, I mean ALL, from 1992 to 2007. Now, I smoke a little weed now and then. Maybe 1x a week.
