After exhausting myself and getting some drinks of water I socialized for a bit. The powder was not a completely clean experience however, as after about 2 hours of the effects the flatline started to waver and conversations were breaking up now and again. I decided that I would focus on the trippy lights and visuals they had projected on the walls when I couldnt socialize, and told myself that any negative thoughts or feelings are only products of the substance. Try to ignore it. (much easier said than done I know, but you can apply it!) After some ups and downs in the group and some crazy adventures, another hour and a half later we were all pretty calm. The MDMA powder had gradually faded like it was supposed to, but some of my friends still felt a little empty or neutral. I felt the last of the powders emotional effects were over, and that I now felt sober once more. This felt good though, because the experience was interesting, insightful and positive.
