Halfway through the walk, remembering the claims of enhanced sense of touch for MDMA, I start to rub with my fingertips around my shoulders and back and neck--and feel my eyes start to roll back in my head and my knees almost buckle! Holy crap! It wasn't pleasure in a sexual way...more just like a good backrub raised about an order of magnitude in it's enjoyability. I wish I had a masseuse handy!
