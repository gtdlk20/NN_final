Let me explain it:  In the end of 2001 I spent 3 months in Spain, where I basically studied spanish and partied like a madman.  It was a break I took from my life back home, where I had a great deal of responsibility in my job, even thought I was only 22. I started to get tired of it and decided I needed a break, so I went to Spain, I was in the mood for partying, enjoying myself and exploring new things.
