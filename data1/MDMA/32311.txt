Every now and then me and some friends just roll for the hell of it. My friend warned me about the tablets being pretty strong but I thought to myself I have taken 1 and a half pills before I'm sure 2 wont matter much. Well the time I was high was really amazing felt fuckin insane in a good way lol. But the crash was HELL I was laying on my bed weak, sweating, nauseated and aching all over. I finally had to go throw up, I stood up and walked out of my room heading for the bathroom but then everything started turning black and I passed out right then and there. About 1 min later however my sister shook me awake and I went back to bed. Nothing worse happened but just learned that, I should be more careful when dosing Ecstasy =]
