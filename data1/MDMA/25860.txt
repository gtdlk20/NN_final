I went to the apartment of two of my best friends one Saturday evening. We three, took one pill each (Mitsubishi DoubleStack). Then we started packing up their waterbong. They assured me that this would at least keep our minds off the MDMA until it's effects started. It did just that and I also believe that it had an interesting side effect, I'll discuss that later. About 45 minutes after taking the pill, my two friends were already equipped with water bottles and black and mild tips to chew on, and I started having this wonderfully euphoric feeling. My two friends were already feeling the effects. I had tingles all over my body and I couldn't keep from just feeling completely content. I was feeling the effects of the smoke, but I wasn't lazy like normal. I was perfectly happy just sitting and observing my friends conversation and the same second if one of them wanted to go for a walk or go across the hall to talk to the neighbors I was ready and willing to go. All I can say is my first time was wonderful and I think that we became 10 times better friends that night. We had no problem letting down our guard and just being exactly who we really were.
