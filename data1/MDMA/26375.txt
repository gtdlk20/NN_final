It was something Id never experienced before. I started seeing things that werent actually there. Well, it was more like objects that are there that formed into something else in my mind as I viewed it. It was messed up, two bags of trash formed itself into looking like a cat and a dog plushie. Id stare at it in confusion for about 2 minutes and it would slowly turn back into its original image, as just two bags.
