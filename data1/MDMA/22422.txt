I then called Mike and told him to forget smoking me out because Stan was going to be getting some good pot. Mike asked if he Daniel and Lyle could come over and smoke instead, because the shrooms fell through at the last moment. I told them to come on over and that way they could meet my friend Stan. Before long I had all four of these guys over, and we were trying to get our hands on some dank. While hunting down some dank, Stan happened to call someone trying to get rid of seven rolls. He asked if we were interested, and we all looked at each other (having never tried X before) and enthusiastically said yeah.
