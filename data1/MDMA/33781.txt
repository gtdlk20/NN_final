All 4 of us danced all night and had a lot of fun drawing with markers all over us and sniffing vicks. The markers where like answers to my questions in life. As if everything is too serious, and I need to return to my childhood. I felt at home with this girl in my childish state of mind. Everything was simpler to think about and I felt like I floated away to a cloud. I had found my miracle.
