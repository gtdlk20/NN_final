More than two years later, in the spring of '03, the timing turned out just right. I overheard my best friend and this girl I had been seeing off and on (she didn't want to commit to a relationship) talking about holding an E party. I decided that I would like to participate. I, understanding the importance of comfort with this drug, helped design the setting, mix some of the music, and pick the guests. The party consisted of ten people that all knew each other in a small house with a big backyard. I openly told my best friend that I would pay for the pills and help set up the house, but I could still back out if I didn't feel sure of myself. With his assurance, I went ahead with the party.
