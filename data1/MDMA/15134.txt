T-48:00 hrs. , we shop for supplies (water, candles, oils various other things that over the months we see and think wow that would be fun the next time we roll), we get the kids ready for there adventure (a weekend at grandmas or the like), I load the computer with a huge collection of music, one folder full of techno trance and one with soft mellow stuff like Enigma, lots of music. We get the house completely clean, sheets, blankets, towels, clothing, trash took out, everything done.
