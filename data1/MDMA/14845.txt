Another downside was the psychological effects. The drive home was decent, my brain was simply just fried and stupefied and I didnÂ’t have normal cognitive function. I found my thoughts to be much slower, and I felt very tired. The tiredness was probably the most intense sensation. What happened that night was probably the biggest eye-opener for me. I felt relatively normal with some minor residual comedown effects. But C and I decided to finish smoking a joint. However, I did not get high when I smoked, I got sideways. All of the negative effects of smoking weed were amplified (racing heart rate, cotton mouth, anxiety, etc) while the positive effects were essentially nonexistent. Then what unfolded was a self-induced panic attack. I had a horrible fear that I had permanently damaged my tongue, so that I would taste blood for the rest of my life. I also had a horrific fear that I would never be able to feel happiness again. A very peculiar thing about smoking, though, was that I was reacting similar to how I was when I was on E and C noticed it. I would roll my eyes, move my hands and feet, and would smack my mouth. Even though I did not feel any Ecstasy. It was uncomfortable.
