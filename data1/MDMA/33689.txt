It was a lazy early spring Sunday.  One of those cold and wet days where the only option is to find something to do indoors on your day off work.  After waking up early--any time before 10am is early for me--my friend and I decided we would go do some spring clothes shopping.  We had a trip to California coming up in a month but we had no spring clothes.  My friend (I'll call him Yakko) was one of those kinds of shoppers who will go into the same store 15 times but never find anything he likes, so I knew it was going to be a long day.  Feeling up to a challenge that day, we decided we would take some MDMA along with us to consume before setting out on our shopping excursion.
