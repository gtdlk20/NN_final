After the support band we sat down again for a while, talking the whole time.  When Underworld finally walked onto the stage the crowd went crazy.  It seemed like a lot of people, although not everyone, had taken something similar to what we had.  I haven't so far really experienced love for strangers or a wish to hug them while on Ecstasy.  Don't get me wrong - I love to see the other people dancing and soak in the atmosphere.  I do feel some kinship with the other people, especially if I think they are on drugs too.  I feel far more tolerant of sweaty people being in close contact with me than I normally would. But it feels more like benevolence than affection.
