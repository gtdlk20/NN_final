I found that taking a low dose of Prozac as I was coming down helped lessen my crashes.  I have clinical depression, so any break from my gloominess, like the one Ex provides, works really well.  When I'm depressed and coming out of a happy experience back to my sadness, I guess a crash is to be expected.
