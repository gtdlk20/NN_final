B has to drive to Dicks (a sporting goods store) to buy binoculars for come reason.  Still excited and jittery for the roll to begin, I accompany him inside.  Im standing at the binocular case when the Molly kicks in.  An orgasmic rush of warmth flows up my spine, into my neck, and gravity can no longer hold me.  I lose 135lbs over the course of two minutes.  My field of vision widens to 180 degrees and I can feel my pupils beginning to dilate.  An ethereal and sparkly mist hangs over everything, obscuring nothing yet somehow still visible.  The mist isnt so much a visual as an intensification of the ambient light and a result of my rapid change in perception.  I begin to bounce up and down on my feet, feeling invincible and overflowing with happiness.  I flit around B as he picks up the binoculars and we head to the checkout.
