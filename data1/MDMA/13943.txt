During the experience I did not take my temperature.  My body felt flushed at times and chilly during others.  I was feeling hot for the first hour and a half and then after hour three I felt a bit chilled.  My pulse did elevate but I never became truly concerned.  I checked my pulse a number of times throughout the afternoon but only properly measured and documented it twice.  Once at 135 BPM at T + 00:41 and again at 104 BPM at T + 02:17.  Both of these are notably high for me.  My sober resting heart rate is around 65 BPM.  At no point did I have any chest pain and irregular heartbeats.  My breathing  remained normal throughout the experience.
