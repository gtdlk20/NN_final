We went to the bathroom, and I sat down in the stall and felt like I couldn't bring myself to actually go pee. I kept looking around the stall all wide-eyed. It was so bright in there. I wondered about the patterns on the door; black paint with little white spots. I was starting to breathe really heavily, and I could practically feel my eyes dilating. Flushing the toilet ground on my every nerve, it was so loud that I closed my eyes and covered my ears. I began to feel slightly nauseous, and overheated, but I felt so good that I knew even if I were to throw up, it would feel incredible. At one point I even had the thought of, 'man, I hope I throw up!' Luckily, it was quite subdued when I drank enough water.
