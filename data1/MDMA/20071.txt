After feeling somewhat less panicky I stood again, and E and I laid down against the wall on top of a blanket and some pillows. The panic faded, and I was convinced that we had, in fact, taken ecstasy, as I suddenly felt overwhelmingly good and very cuddly. My time perception and memory from the trip are somewhat skewed, so some events may be missing, and the ones I present may not be in the correct order.
