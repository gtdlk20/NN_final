When taking the drug I feel excited, and my problems and insecurities subside for the duration of the peak experience. I feel alert and can always have a great time out, the drug facilitates this. When 'coming down' from MDMA I gradually become paranoid and negatively self aware which makes being in public a nightmare. I will also say that the most annoying aspect of taking e is the rapid weight loss I experience, epecially in my face as my features appear extremely drawn and gaunt due to the drugs effects. I still gets cravings for ecstasy and I think this is more a 'craving' for the fun times I have had in the past. I like MDMA but don't like the comedown one bit.
