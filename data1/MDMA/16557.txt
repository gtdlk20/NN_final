[Such optimism! Drug use is a stressful and emotionally charged subject for my mom, and my dad defers to her, at least in her earshot. They once caught me with cannabis while I was home for a weekend (I try to keep my habits to myself); my mom was displeased and let me know it.  My dad was too, at least in person. A few days later he sent me a wordy email which reduced to to: "We can't control what you do. Just don't be an idiot." I hold out some hope that he may be more willing than he seems.
