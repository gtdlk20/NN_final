I am of the rave scene, but I like to be educated on what I do. When I was learning about MDMA before I actually did it, I learned about the phenomenon of 'losing the magic.' After trying MDMA, the possibility of losing the magic seemed absurd, because of the intensely positive experience I had. I did a great deal of MDMA throughout the last half of 2006 and the first half of 2007, on average 2 ecstacy pills once a week, and began to experience a loss of the magic. It just wasnt the same because I knew what was going to happen, what to do to make it better, etc. I went on a long hiatus (July 2007-May 2008) because of a matter I was attending to away from home. Recently I indulged in my old pastime to celebrate my homecoming with a few friends. As would be obvious, my tolerance for the substance had decreased dramatically. Onset of effects occurred after about 20 minutes and one and a half pills, where before it took anywhere from 40 minutes to 2 hours to hit me. My entire experience lasted from 6pm well into the next day. I started coming down around noon the next day. It was an exceptionally laid back experience, rather than being up and talking and dancing I spent most of the time just sitting on the couch positively exited to exist. Everything just seemed exceptionately beautiful. I would assume, after my experience, that a long enough break from MDMA can render one susceptible to all the things they recall being so wondrous from the first time they did it. I hope I am not the only one to be able to recover the magic and I hope this was helpful.
