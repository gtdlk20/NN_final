We dithered on the corner for a few minutes.  My Dad was highly confused by the choices: go back to the house for change, get a taxi instead, or just quickly walk up the road to the venue?  I was feeling restless and said, 'Why are we hanging around on this corner?'  I felt that we might dither there forever.  At that my Dad jogged back up the road towards the house without saying anything.  I made as if to follow him, but suddenly I was uncertain about which direction he had gone in.  I waited patiently for him to come back, totally unconcerned.  The area was unusually busy due to the football, people coming and going constantly.  I seemed to hear a lot of sirens as well, but perhaps the drugs were exaggerating it.  In all there was a sense of relentless activity and excitement that matched my state of mind quite well.  I felt as if I was in the middle of something big, even though I was just standing around watching people walk past.
