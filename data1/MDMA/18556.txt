Then I started seeing stuff and harsh grinding my teeth, like I saw Renaissance angels on the ceiling, you know like the ones in the paintings with all the heavenly colours, they were still but they were kind of like sticking out of the ceiling but they weren't moving. I told my friend and I don't think she believed me. I didn't think I believed myself. It bothered me that she didn't believe me. I asked for her to join me, she was still in the bathroom fixing her hair, and she told me to just wait. It pissed me off. Time seemed to go on forever, I didn't want to wait for her anymore, I just couldn't stand it. I hugged her stuffed toys and waited for her. Finally she came, and she put on some X-Mal Deutschland.
