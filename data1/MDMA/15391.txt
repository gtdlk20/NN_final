My friend and I took a very easy hike that day, and went to a spa to get a massage that day.  When the masseuse touched me I suddenly could hear her thoughts and I said to myself, 'please, I just want to relax, I don't want to hear her thoughts or think about anything right now.  I just want to relax'.  And so I was able to.
