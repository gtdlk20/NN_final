After dancing around for a while we again returned to the couches where I sat on one arms outstretched with the A/C blowing on me (I was drenched in sweat) I closed my eyes and took a deep breath and let it out.  This was one of the most pleasurable sensations I have ever felt, it felt exactly like the moments after a great orgasm, I was just enthralled by the experience and the deluge of pleasurable sensations, it was clear that these were some clean rolls (very little amphetamine cut if any).  I looked at J and L and they too had similar orgasmic looks on their faces, I talked to J for a bit, I dont remember exactly what was said but I assume it was along the lines of how good we felt, M was sitting next to me and we too started talking and he told me he didnt want the feeling to end (as I had told him hed be saying that since this was to be his first MDMA experience).  It was incredible I felt so in tune and connected to everyone I talked to.  I started talking to some random people that were sitting next to us and they became our single serving friends  they too had popped some of the maseratis and were in similar ecstatic mind frames.  However one of the people they were with didnt look so good and being fairly well versed in the effects of MDMA and being a nursing student asked him if he was alright.  He replied yes but his face told a different story, I asked him how much he took and he said that he had popped THREE of the maseratis, judging from my level of  glorious intoxication I knew that this guy was out to lunch.  He looked flushed and had this blank/focused look on his face, I told him I was a nurse (in an effort to make him feel better) and to just relax and I gave him my full water bottle which he promptly downed, M then gave him his which he also downed.  He looked like he desperately needed hydration so M gave him his bottle and got another one, a little while later he looked better and seemed to be enjoying himself which gave me a great sense of accomplishment as I had just helped a person in need.
