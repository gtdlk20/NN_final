Then, quite suddenly, the complete and godly plateau to which I had been lifted, faded. I felt very cold and alone realizing this feeling of complete oneness with the universe, of complete absence of fear is something Ill only experience again when I die and my soul is returned to this state. It was profound, it was earth-shattering.. it was probably the most beautiful thing Ive experienced in my life. I felt so very thankful. It must have lasted for an hour or two (judging by the daylight and what my friends reported), but it felt timeless and too short.
