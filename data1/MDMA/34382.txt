i decided that this drug was messing with my head and that i needed to concentrate on something but i was so trashed that i found it hard to do. i fell into an ehole which many people have never been in. i thought i had a ten minute conversation with this guy right next to me and when i asked him why he didnt answer me he said that i had not said anything to him at all. it felt like i had been in another body because i snapped back into reality and wondered where i had actually gone. then we took another pill.
