12:00 PM Digweed starts his set and it was as if someone flipped a switch on my body.  INSTANTLY rolling real real hard, it was incredible.  Lots of eye wiggles, everything felt very fluid like, and the deep bass from Digweed's masterful progressive house was enveloping me.  For the next 20 minutes, I was rolling so hard I had completely lost myself in the music and lights...not quite coherent as to what was going on during this time, other than it felt absolutely amazing and was wickedly intense.  (This differs from my prior experience on E where at no point was I not coherent and clear thinking.)
