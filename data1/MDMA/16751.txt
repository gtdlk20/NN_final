I was extremely thirsty throughout the trip.  We went through a 3 L CamelBak between the two of us, although I drank way more than he did (at least 2 L if not more).  The water felt so smooth and amazing as it went down my throat too.  I was so fucked up I had no sense of how much I was or was not drinking, and knew that dehydration was a risk factor as well as water intoxification, so I kept telling my boyfriend to drink but to keep track of how much we were drinking (because I had no clue, and he was not affected as strongly by the Molly as I was).
