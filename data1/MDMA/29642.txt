T+4hrs: The last two hours werent bad, but euphoria or feelings of love never developed.  I got some good pondering done, but I felt little physical energy other than my strongly-beating heart.  My eyes were closed almost the entire time.  My pupils were very, very dilated, but I did not experience the softness or sparkle around lights that is usually apparent with MDMA.  This is very unlike what these tablets did over a year ago.  I also did not experience any memory problems, but then again, I don't smoke pot.
