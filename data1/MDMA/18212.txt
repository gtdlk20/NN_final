Personally I am quite a sociable person but I also need introverted time to myself, that means that when I dont feel I have much to say or arent very sociable I take some time to go and do something without my friends and enjoy the atmosphere around me. That doesnt make me an introvert either, but it allows me to come back feeling refreshed and more engaged in discussion etc. My friends understand this, and thus we function more closely as a group because of it.
