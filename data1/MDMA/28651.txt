The buildup to the drops began to feel like pure ecstasy, and when the bass started hitting I felt it inside me. I couldn't stop thinking of how much I loved my friends while this was taking place, holding their heads with my hands and kissing them. They would laugh and kiss and hug me back and I had never felt so at peace, so in love with a group of people and in such a part of a 'crew' so to speak. I'd always had troubles finding a close set of friends as I'd moved around 4 times before I was 18, so I kept having to adjust and make new ones. But at this moment, I had never felt more love for anybody in the whole world.
