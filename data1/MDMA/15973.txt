Some jaw clenching so I pop in a little plastic dental shim I've had for years (an 'NTI device'), which works wonderfully to keep the clench under control. I put on some music (Wagnerian opera, chased by some Radiohead and a little new-age stuff) and lay down on the couch. I'm still very much 'up', eyes fully dilated, but not 'speedy' at all. As I lay in the dark and listen to the music it's as if I'm hearing it for the first time, with a new richness and vibrance, as if I had never *really* heard it before. Is this how babies see the world? As the music plays I think again of my parents and the need to heal the rift. I'm finally ready for it...and I think they are too.
