After class, I went home, stayed up till about 1 PM, then crashed for about 2 hours, till some friends came over and woke me up. I didn't feel tired though, I felt fine. I slept fine that night, and haven't had a problem since. The one thing I did notice, was throughout that day, I would occasionally get the same feeling I got just prior to the really fast part of the come-up.
