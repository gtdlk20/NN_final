After we gathered ourselves we went back downstairs and that's when the colors, visuals, and distortions started. My walls had patterns all over them it looked like they were made up of grids and I could see a blue wave of energy in everything as if it was all connected somehow. My ceilings turned pink, blue and green and the patterns swirled together making beautiful movements above me. We were very distracted and couldn't focus on one thing at a time, we'd go upstairs to get water and come back down and completely forget. 3 am rolls around and we start listening to music and dancing, I changed my outfit about 3 times throughout my experience. We tried to have sex but it wasn't working out that well we kept getting distracted but touching and being with each other felt extremely good and we shared a lot of personal things and I felt like we connected on a spiritual level in a way.
