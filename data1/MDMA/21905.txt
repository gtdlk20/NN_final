When that class ended I headed off to my next period class with a huge grin on my face. But during that class at around 2:40 I had started to lose some of the feelings from the 2 pills so I decided to take the other two, my rationale for this was that I had to be at work in a little over an hour and I wanted to feel great when I started my shift. One of my good friends who despises drugs was sitting besides me during that class and I didn't want to risk him noticing what I was doing so I asked to go to the washroom. When I got to the washroom I headed for a stall and decided to try snorting the pill. My one friend said snorting it was really good, but stung your nose alot.  I decided to do it anyways, so I crushed up the pill on my credit card, I was surprised at how much powder came from that one little pill when it got crushed up. After snorting it  I headed back to class and when I got back to class (I didn't realize that I had already been from the class for over 20 minutes) I felt like I was floating across the floor, my nose stung and the drips in the back of my throat tasted awful, but I didn't care. Nothing bothered me and I couldn't stop talking to my one friend.
