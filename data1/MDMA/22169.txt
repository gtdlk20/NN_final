I'm still rolling really hard.  I drive everyone to a lake nearby, because Lauren wants to go swimming.  Throughout the evening, I had really enjoyed this girl.  The thing that stuck out to me the most was that she put on my red lipstick.  Now, NONE of my girlfriends wear red lipstick, it's my trademark.  And so when Lauren put it on, I was absolutely overwhelmed by a feeling of sisterhood.  We were the only girls among a group of boys, and we were also the youngest ones of the group.  This tripped me out for a long time, and I decided that no matter what I would always treat Lauren like a sister.
