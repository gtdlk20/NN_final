Upon walking back inside into the dark room,  the computer light catches my eye. We watch some electric sheep visualizations just for the fun of it. I notice how in sync they are with the music I am playing on another page. As if everything is supposed to fit together perfectly.... all the while we give each other back rubs or kiss or caress each other's faces, hair, clothes, anything. We are both excited for our friend to roll with us next weekend for his first time. We tell him all the things we want to show him and how much he'll love it.
