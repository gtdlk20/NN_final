Now I go to find Ryan and all of his friends, whom Ive hung out with at the other two raves Ive been to. Theyre a bunch of awesome people. So my sister and I walked up the stairs in the very back of the arena, which had the best view of the lights. I see Brian standing up and waving to me, and I smile and walk past a couple sitting down and give him a hug. Then I say hi to the rest of the group, everyone welcoming and nice as usual. My sister and I sit down, enjoying this new, better view of the lights, the music still sounding heavenly.
