The negative effects were fairly mild; I got fairly dehydrated based on the color of my pee, but I was drinking water or Sunny D for the entirety of the roll so I never got lightheaded or thirsty. I also experienced a loss of hunger during the roll and the days after. Finally, I experienced a tendency to clench my muscles, particularly my jaw and leg muscles.
