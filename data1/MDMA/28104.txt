I was at the beach with my boyfriend (I will call him Sam) and we were staying for a week at a small beach condo with a balcony that over looked the ocean. We planned on fixing our relationship with MDMA since it has been rocky. The last time we took it a year or so back it helped us open up to each other and talk clearly without our built up resentment getting in the way.
