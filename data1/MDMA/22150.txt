I'm driving to meet my friends when I drop my first pill.  Note: I'm aware that it won't hit me for another half-hour or so, I was not planning on driving as it hit me, as that sudden change in my mindset could potentially be dangerous while on the road.  At this point, all I'm thinking about is whether or not my friends will enjoy the night.  One other friend of mine, we'll call him Samuel, is planning on dropping a pill, but besides that, they will all be sober.  I worry also about another of my friends whom we'll call Michael, he's on probation and receives lie-detector tests, thus he will probably end up getting in trouble for being with people who are high.
