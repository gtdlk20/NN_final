The next day was perfect though, except that for about a week, chewing was a painful process. I remembered what it was like to feel happy, and how wonderful it is to connect with other people. After working up the courage (which took a few months) I put myself into counselling. It was the best decision I ever made. And I have E to thank, and of course S, who is the best thing that ever happened to me. S brought me to the realization that I needed help, and E reminded me that it is possible to trust people, and that talking to others is one of the best things that a person can do to keep their mind healthy and happy.
