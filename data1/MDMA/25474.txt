Since then I have rolled many times, but obviously nothing compares to your first time.  I highly recomend anyone rolling (in moderation of course) as it truely has given me a new outlook on life.  For a few hours I was free of anything that bothered me, any problem was shrugged away.  When I was coming down in GOR's apartment, I sat and thought about things that bothered me and nothing could bring me down.  Even if you only do it once I think everyone should roll.  Roll in moderation and roll at a rave.  Meet some phat people and have a kickass time.
