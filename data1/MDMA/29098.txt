Was it worth it? Yes. Each time Ive taken ecstasy at a rave setting its really been an amazing experience thats taught me a lot. When Im on it and at a rave I feel so connected to people and I just love how everyone is nice to each other and theres no judging  you just feel like you can be yourself without any restrictions. And youre just so optimistic about everything. Everything about it  the music, the lights, the people, the shift in perspective  are all worth the holes in the brain, in my opinion. Its an experience that youll never understand unless youve done it, and I know that lots of people are gonna judge me because its a drug, but I dont care. Its not like Im doing it every weekend, and in my opinion the experiences are worth it. If only everyone could be as nice to people as they are on ecstasy as they are in real life. I guess thats the depressing thing once the drug is over. You realize youve been living in an ideal world for the past few hours, and now youre back to this.
