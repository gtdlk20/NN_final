We spent the next hr or so just talking very quickly and deeply around all sorts of random stuff, when suddenly somebody realized that B was missing.  My heart almost stopped.  The hammered drunk guy that I had given ecstasy too was missing somewhere in the woods.  What if he passed out?  What if he was seizing up right now on the forest floor, and we were all just sitting around talking shit and enjoying our buzz?  Most everyone else wasn't really worried and said he was probably just exploring, but the thoughts stuck with me and definitely had an effect on my feelings.  I felt great sure, but I still had worries brewing underneath it.
