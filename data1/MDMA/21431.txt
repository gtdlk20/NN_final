So now at about 8am I'm starting to come down but I can still see patterns in the walls and math equations, don't ask me why, were coming off the walls at me. My phone was still kind of blurry but I had reading glasses so I could read my updates that I sent to a friend who's really interested in these type of experiences. There were still quite a bit of colors on my phone but the words no longer would move together in patterns on my phone.  At about 10am I was coming down pretty quickly the colors were still there but not intense at all and I could only see the movements of air in my room. Another hour went by and I was ready to sleep it off. When I woke up my eyes still felt really weird and I felt extremely uncoordinated. Al I wanted to do was lay in bed under the covers for the rest of the day.
