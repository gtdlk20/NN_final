(about 8:45) We get to the rave and there are kids every where. I felt like some one pulled some strings in me up like a marionette and I was AWAKE. I stepped out of the car and the earth beneath my feet made me feel very 'at home' as if I was a child re-born from mother Earth's womb. My female friend and I walked ahead of everyone else (due to having so much energy). We talked about how much we loved music and I realized that I had a very strong bond with her. She made me very happy and I gave her a big hug. I felt very content with it and almost sisterly. We stepped into the rave scene and i felt like I had just walked though a time-warp. The music made me very happy to be alive. I took the girl I didn't know by the hand and we went to dance. I don't think I had ever had such a fun time dancing. I didn't care how others thought of me, nor did I care who they were, where they came from, what they wore, etc. I danced with this girl for about an hour and a half straight untill my muscles were telling me to stop. The girl and I went down strairs to the chill-out room where some really phat trance beats were playing. They had these beautiful visuals projected on the screen of peoples eyes. I then looked into the girls eyes and they made me want to dive into them because they were so deep and green. I felt strongly connected to her so I took her hand and put it to my heart for her to know that I am alive. We talked for about half an hour (it's about 10 pm now) about the most amazing things. I felt my mind swell with knowledge about her. She told me that she felt close to me and so we kissed for a few minutes. It felt like something foreign had intruded into me. But at the same time, it felt good, so I stayed.
