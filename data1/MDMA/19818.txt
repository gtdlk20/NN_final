Someone brought my some water, my friend Chad I think.  I sculled the water pretty quickly although Briggs told me to go easy.  I had a guy called Cameron sitting next to me, he knew well the ecstasy experience and looked at me with interest.  Meanwhile my vision was pulsing, nothing like alcohol or pot, but like slipping between two worlds, one of them reality.  I sunk back into my seat, unsure of the world in front of me.  I began to consolidate thoughts to myself, thoughts about forces we could not control, weird thoughts were entering into my mind which now I cannot recall.  I could not quite grasp the concepts however I was being locked out, unworthy of the understanding.
