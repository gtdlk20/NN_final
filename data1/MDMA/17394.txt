During the onset everyone drank Sunny D and engaged in conversation. I was told to forget about taking the pill in order to roll faster, which I did fairly effectively once we began smoking more weed. The roll started very abruptly, yet at the same time, it hit me softly, and was very pleasant. I started really rolling about 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
