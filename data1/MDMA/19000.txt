Each of us learned alot about ourselves during those nine hours, we each also learned alot about each other and became much closer friends.  Jen and I now talk often and are close friends when we had never known each other before.  Jen and James are together, and they never would have been due to each of their uncertainties if they hadn't rolled.  James and Sarah are now friends and their parents received the talk very well and it seems like alot of the stress on their family is lifted.  and finally sarah and I are back to being the best friends that we always were, basically insepparable when we are together, and a perfect complementary friend pair, like Jay and Silent bob, or Chewie and Han Solo.
