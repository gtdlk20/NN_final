I met my lady friends at the Jacuzzi and we hung out for about an hour and a half.  They had no idea I was rolling because I figured they might trip out about that.  Forewarning about hot water immersion on MDMA, as your body temperature is already higher than normal (or sometimes colder, for that matter), its extremely important to not stay fully immersed for too long.  Keep hydrated, etc. etc.  Anyways, the Jacuzzi was absolutely amazing.  I loved the feeling of the skin of the water on my palms.  Not to mention, dunking my head shortly was like a different world of feelings.  Underwater, I felt like I was floating (more-so than usual) and every part of my body tingled with pleasure.  I wanted to kiss one of the girls (or both haha) more than anything, but they are too good of friends.  I also wanted to be upfront with them of my mindset, but again, I didnt know how theyd react.  Plus, I want to share everything with everyone when I'm rolling so I had to tell myself to forget about sharing and talk with them.  This proved to be the right decision, and I found myself perfectly content with carrying on a conversation with them.  Around 11:30PM, I began to get the normal eye-flutters commonly experiences with MDMA.  The girls finally left and I returned to my house (the pool was in my community, so no more risky driving).
