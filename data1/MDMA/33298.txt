2:00am - This feeling in my won't go away.  I HAVE to rave.  I cracked 2 15 inch glowsticks.   KEEP IN MIND I have never raved before.  My friends couldn't believe how well I did it.  I couldn't stop, I just wanted to dance.  All I could see was the glowsticks, and all I could hear was the music, louder and clearer then ever.
