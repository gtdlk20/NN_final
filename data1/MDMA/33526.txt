    The experience has relaxed me and had a positive change on my overall attitude.  I have witnessed girls exhibiting bisexuality in clubs & at parties.  Within the past two months, my partner & I, both straight and married, have become physically closer.  Two weeks ago while our wives were aways we went 'skinny dipping' and ended up achieving erections.  There has been no oral contact, just touching.  Neither of us are awake of homosexual tendencies when not rolling.  Now there seems to be a whole new element to partying. It feels good, it's enjoyable, there's no shame even though it's not discussed when sober.  I have no sense of switching sides, we just enjoy the experience.  I'm wondering if I discovered a side of me that I didn't know existed or is it just an extension of the touchy-feely nature of MDMA.  In the past we have shared girls, but this is new.  I am a very secure person and confident of who I am.  While I wouldn't share this with associates, I thought it may be helpful if someone else has a similar experience.
