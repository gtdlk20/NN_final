We spent the next 3 hours wandering aimlessly around the megamall, unable to drive home, or even find our way to the car.  This left me reason to suspect there were some adulterants in the MDMA.  The batch is known as Cookies and Cream.  It was a rather small pill and the appearance is white, with brown flecks and no noticable picture.   My moral of this experience--get an MDMA test kit, and never try shopping while on Ecstasy.
