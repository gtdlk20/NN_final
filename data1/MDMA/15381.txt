Before we dosed I had stated that my intention that night was to fully open my third eye and psychic abilities.  I had always had some clairvoyant experiences, but due to my religious upbringing, I had deliberately shut them down when I was young.  In recent years I had been trying to get back in touch with that part of me, and I'm happy to say that night I succeeded.  I suddenly became aware of a third eye between my two normal eyes and found that I could see even with my eyes closed.  My friend had been struggling with a health problem for some time, and I found that I could see inside her, and could see the problem and was able to pull it out of her.  I also could stand outside my body and see myself.  I was able to see and feel my crown chakra, and was very aware of the connection from the crown chakra to heaven.  All of this was getting to be a bit much for me, so I pulled myself out of it for a while, and danced with my friend and talked to her.
