I am the male companion referenced in the report above. I am also 35  years old, and had only taken MDMA a few times prior to this experience.  Prior to the incident in question, we had had sex twice that night, once  right after we ingested Ecstasy, and once perhaps an hour later after we  both had begun to feel the effects of the drug. I did not achieve an  orgasm during the second session of sex. Approximately 20-25 minutes  later, my companion began to perform oral sex on me. After a couple  minutes I became aware of an unfamiliar sensation -- I looked down and  my companion had swallowed the entirety of my phallus. She appeared to  notice at the same time, and we agreed her gag reflex appeared to be  suppressed by MDMA.
