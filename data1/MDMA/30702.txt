I started taking E in very calm settings about two years ago. It became more and more frequent, until I was rolling at least once per season before I decided to attend an actual rave. I was there for the music and it seemed a lot of people were there for the culture, so I decided raves weren't my thing. I don't even listen to electronic music normally.
