At the end of july I had my first XTC experience. Me and my ex-girlfriend both took one green 2000 tab wich I stole from my mother. I still think they had some MDA in it because I had some pretty funny visuals: I stood half naked in front of a mirror and while looking at my muscles I saw myself turning into a H-man type of character, wich was really surprising. The pattern on my girlfriends shirt changed and at some point we looked at eachother and we both saw sunglasses on our heads. Also the whole night it seemed as if the room was smaller(or I was bigger). The year after that we did it nearly every month but in a more easy way: never more than half a pill at a time and we just sat at home talking about our problems, analyzing and trying to solve them. The next one and half year I worked as a cook(40-50 hours a week) so we couldn't party to much.
