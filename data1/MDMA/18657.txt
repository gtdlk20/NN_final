I also struggled to project my voice, it felt like too much of an effort. That weird body buzz I was feeling all day caused me to feel like walking and sitting at the same time, it caused me to feel uncomfortable and like I should be doing something. I was all twitchy and at times edgy at other times my reactions and reflexes were completely delayed and slowed down. My back ached from sitting on concrete all night and I started feeling waves of depression along with that strange body buzz. I could not wait to get home to just lay there on my bed, unable to sleep but in a braindead state.
