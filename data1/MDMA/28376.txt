But like all good things, it had to end. I took T home around 5:30 in the morning, he was still rolling pretty hard while I had come down a lot. I went home and cleaned up the basement and went upstairs around 6. I still to this day havent ever crashed, just feel kinda burnt out the next day, except when I take 2 pills, I just dont feel all there for a few days. Now I take 5-HTP every day and that takes care of things.
