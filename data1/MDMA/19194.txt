I was very frightened at first at the idea of doing E, but I thought that this was a unique opportunity and that's what the trip was all about anyway.  So I went to bed at 10 saturday night, woke up at 5:30 a.m. and walked like a zombie in the cold weather of november until I got to the club.  I took the pill just before I entered, a 'Mitsubishi', I can never forget.
