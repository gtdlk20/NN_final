The first time i rolled was at my christmas ball. It was definitely better than going to some club because all of my friends were there. I took my roll as soon as i got there and about a half hour later i just felt like talking to everybody. My date and about half my table was rolling to so whenever we sat down it was non stop talking about what was going on. I started drinknig water because everyone told me to but i didn't really want it. My advice is drink it anyway and have some gum. I was biting my face off which doesn't look good when 5 teachers are staring at you. So anyway, i must have danced to every song they played. I felt like i was completely insync with the beats and rythms. I was grinding with everyone. Even girls, but they knew i was on e so they just went along with it. I thought i'd be shaky and nervous but it was the opposite. I was completely relaxed and extremely happy. I just felt like my life was gonna get better. I was so optimistic. I knew i would do it again. And since then i've done it 4 times. But let me tell you, nothing can compare to the first time. The best part for me now is the very beginning and then about 2 hrs after. I have periods where i am extremely restless and aggravated and i just can't decide what i want to do. I feel like 'why did i even do this' and normal things irritate me. I feel like the world is just a bunch of shit and nothing is fun or worth doing. I get extremely angry when i think about going to school the next day or to work. I only want to be around people who are rolling. Don't get me wrong it's a great drug but just be careful with it.
