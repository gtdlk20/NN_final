I felt like I was in some weird Freddy Krugger type dream thing, where you need to have somebody watch you when you sleep and when you start freaking out they need to wake you up. This happened to me and my friends, always in the nights after ingestion of MDMA.(but not during use of the drug, it's like the day after the day you take it.)
