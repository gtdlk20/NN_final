Jan 4th: I resumed taking 15 milligrams of Adderall this morning. It appears that I now have an increased sensitivity to Adderall. Increased heart rate (more than before). Im having what feels like a mini MDMA experience. The kind other people describe when theyre having an actual MDMA experience. I want to write a letter to everyone I know and tell them how much I appreciate and love them. I feel a vulnerability Ive never felt before. This euphoria wore off two hours after taking the Adderall. I ran errands later and went to a friends birthday drop-in early evening. Ive developed a cold which I never get. Eyesight is better, still not clear.
