If great friends wouldn't have been around to take care of me, I'd seriously have dialed 911 or (worse yet) my dad in a panic.  Also, while the touchy-feely sensation is definitely one of the ups of X, getting overly physical with someone could have it negatives in the morning.  Again, I'm glad I was with people who were keeping an eye on me and knew what to expect.  So everyone out there, have a good roll, but BE SAFE!!!!
