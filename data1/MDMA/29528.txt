In the dream realm I now had absolute control; I could teleport to any place or time by seeing it in the ring and climbing through.  A short time later I stumbled across a very kind hearted shaman (he could make my spirit guide laugh) called Shenan who showed me that my other hand was a mirror that I could use like a telescope to see things smaller or bigger depending on whether I looked through the palm or the back of it respectively.  This is how could see the entire universe (and beyond) past the DNA molecules, down to thought vibrations rippling across atoms.  In the real world I could use it to travel inside peoples memories.
