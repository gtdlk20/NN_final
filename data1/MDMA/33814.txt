I dropped the E (a small pink pill shaped like a stopsign) at around 6:45, when I stood up to get out of the car at 7:20, I had the floating happy feeling and I couldn't stop smiling. We were seeing Powerman 5000, so it was heavy, high energy music, and everyone was crowded in the mosh pit. By 8, the music had started and I was rolling hard, with all the bodies around me, it felt wonderful! I started playing with people's hair and jewelery, and had my pacifier there to suck on, though the beaded sting it was on got broken. everyone was smiling at me, I could see right into everyones head, it was as if I was best friends with everyone in there.
