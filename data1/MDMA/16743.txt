Physically I felt very euphoric, with heightened sense of touch and movement like stretching or walking felt extremely blissful and euphoric- like on the level of an orgasm (not that it felt sexual in any way, but it's the best comparison for the intensity of how good it felt).  It was different than my past experiences, where the physical euphoria came almost in waves, like a massage... this time it felt like I was hooked up to an electrical current of physical bliss, and the intensity could be turned up or down based on how much I was being touched or by how much I was moving.  Touching felt wonderful, but moving was simply indescribable... I became so excited about this amazing sensation that I grabbed by boyfriend's hand and insisted we walk down the hiking trail next to our campsite because I wanted him to see how amazing walking felt, and joyfully skipped with him over to the treailhead.  I became completely overjoyed and overwhelmed with how completely perfectly amazingly good I physically felt from walking... I became completely overjoyed and overwhelmed with how completely perfectly amazingly good I physically felt from walking... I couldn't believe it.  It was like the best sensation in the world, and I was in such pleasure-shock that I described it all loudly and gleefully to my boyfriend, unsure if he was experiencing this and somewhat in disbelief at how good it all felt.  'Oh my god it feels amazing! Just, walking... feels so GOOD!' I exclaimed things like this over and over, and with each step/movement the pleasure became more and more intense.
