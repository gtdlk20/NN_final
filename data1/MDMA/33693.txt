I do not recommend allowing yourself access to any form of credit card or ATM. Yakko, who, as I said, was the type of shopper that could spend 2 hours at a mall and not purchase a single item, suddenly became impulse shopper extraordinaire, buying 8 shirts, 9 pairs of shorts and countless accessories.  I, on the other hand, headed directly for Brookstone, with its countless gadgets and contraptions.  About 45 minutes had passed since consuming the dose of MDMA, and I begain having visuals, an experience that I had not endured while under the influence of MDMA previously.  Shopping at this point became, well, not only pointless, but impossible.  Yakko was unable to sign his signature on a receipt for a purchase.  After a peculiar look from the sales clerk, I had to fraudulently inform her that Yakko was epileptic, and he was having a mild hand seizure.
