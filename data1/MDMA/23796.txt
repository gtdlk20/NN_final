To conclude -- I was surprised that we didn't come up more quickly, since insufflation is usually such an efficient method of administration.  Perhaps a higher dose would have come on faster.  I'll probably never know, however, because given the lack of payoff for the relatively painful experience of snorting it, I'll stick to swallowing mdma in the future.
