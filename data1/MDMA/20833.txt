Anyway, I basically stayed up for another hour or so drinking, then crashed around six and just didnt show for my job the next day.  Ive never done that before (though Ive quit my fair share of meaningless jobs).  I woke up in time to go in late, but I felt so upset and depressed about it that I felt I physically couldnt go.  It was all I could do to make it to my teaching job later that day.  Theres no way to really describe how I felt for the next few days (possibly up to a week, I dont remember exactly) besides saying that I was more depressed than Ive ever been in my life.  Id already been kind of depressed about my life situation at that time  about finding out that I was going to have to move apartments, having broken up with my girlfriend a few months before, not liking my job and not knowing what else to do for work, feeling directionless and worried about money in general  but this went beyond what Id felt about all of that before.  It was almost like there was a physical component to this sense of depression and despair, it was really terrible, I really felt like, OK, I dont know what the fuck Im going to do for the rest of the day, let alone the rest of my life.
