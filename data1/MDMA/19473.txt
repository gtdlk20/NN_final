It all started with the first pill back in 1998.  After graduating from highschool I did not exactly know what I wanted to do next academically so I decided to take some time off to think.  Not wanting to be a useless individual I took on a job as a bartender in a fine dining restaurant which stayed open rather late at night.  I was an out going individual who loved to go out, party and have a good time.  Unfortunately due to my working hours I was unable to attend parties or nightclubs with most friends because they would be closing about the same time I finish work.  Accordingly I would be forced to go home early on friday and saturday nights thinking the parties were all over at 2:00am.
