At this point more and more people are starting to roll, while in line, and so people start giving light shows. For some reason, these two small Mexican girls dressed as princesses really caught my eye. They were both wearing tutus and tiaras, and every once in a while Id make contact with them but theyd look away really quickly. I couldnt tell if they were rolling or not. At this point the line keeps growing and people are starting to get angry, including me. I was sick of being stuck in a crowd of bunch of annoying drug addicts, where I literally couldnt even move my arms. I honestly wanted to leave at one point.
