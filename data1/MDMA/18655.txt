After sunrise, and sitting, still talking, around 7:30 we all left that area and walked. We had a destination I believe, however I do not recall it, nor do I recall much more of that day. Only that the other half kept me energetic for quite a while and the pot that we smoked did keep returning an awkward sort of body buzz. I layed on a friend`s front pourch for the longest time. By this time it was just me and two other people, everyone else had gone to crash somewhere. We all agreed that we all felt extremely stupid at that time. Actually, that was the most retarded and slowed down I`ve ever felt. I struggled to keep focused and listen to what was being said when it was being said but I often got confused and lost, which caused me to utter various words such as what and fuck.
