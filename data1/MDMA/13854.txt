I turn my gaze out the window.  A beautiful oak tree sits just outside my window with some of its branches reaching out above me, resting on the roof.  I feel intimately connected to this tree, the squirrel I can see scampering along the branches, the air, the fluffy white clouds that dot the bright blue sky, the sun; all of nature seems like a part of me.  My mind, body, and outside world are molding together in new ways.  The outside world is forging with my mental being while for now; my body remains on its own, separated.
