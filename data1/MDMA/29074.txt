Eventually its about 9pm, and I think Ill be inside the gates within in hour so I decided to take my first pill, the molly. I knew it was cut with pixie stick (yes, the sugary candy) so I figured I would be fine, given that Id feel anything at all. For the next hour Im waiting to feel something, asking my sister repeatedly if my eyes had dilated at all. Its just a little before 10pm, were still in line and I start to feel a little different. I give my 33 year-old sister a big smile for no apparent reason. My sense of touch has changed. Being stuck between all these people is no longer annoying, but actually somewhat pleasant and comforting. I ask my sister, Are my eyes dilated? She replies, Ohhhhh yeahhh. Im rollin.
