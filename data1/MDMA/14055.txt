About this time, I ran into the guy that was to be my rave buddy for the rest of the night. We just ran into each other and started talking. We learned we had A LOT in common (both half-greek, hippies, love to sing and write poetry, etc.). He was rolling too, and for the first time. Even though this was my 4th time, all my previous experiences were pretty mundane compared to what I was experiencing at the moment. I was so pleased with humanity, with our capacity to love and care for each other, with beauty and art and truth. I felt free and the dancing was unleashing my joy and manifesting it so I could share the experience with everyone. I decided that everyone should try rolling, at least once everyone could feel this way. I understood so much more of my purpose, of what was truly important in my life. I dropped all judgements and personal biases and just delighted to share in the company of my fellow living creatures! It was a beautiful feeling indeed. I expressed my desire to share my experience with H, but I knew she wouldnt really understand, couldnt. I loved her so much. She was really my best friend, and she was so loyal to me, promising that shed stay with me for the duration of the rave.
