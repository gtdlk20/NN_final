We were each taking 1.5 E pills. They were yellow and had a sort of lizard looking stamp on them. We received them Saturday night at about 12:30 am and took them around 1. We got them through a trustworthy friend who had taken these specific ones about a week previously, they had been tested to be sure that they were actually what we thought they were (with an at-home testing kit).
