OH MY GOD! Outdoors on xtc was intense, the wind was just orgasmic, the sun's rays were warm and so loving, the sky was beautiful and I just greeted everyone I saw with a smile. I got in the car to go home and I couldn't control myself! It was so intense, every fucking song was my favorite and I loved everyone! On the way home I tried to play sober but this one song came on and I just screamed to the top of my lungs singing with joy! I got home to find my mom home early and I quickly left to go to my buddy's. We walked outside and I took off my shirt and I just walked outside with all the energy I've ever had and talked for what seemed hours. I didn't care though, my friend just carried on conversation with my overly high ass. The total xperience lasted for about 4-5 hours and afterwards I was just completely drained.
