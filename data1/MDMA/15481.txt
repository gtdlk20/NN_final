I'd be very interested to hear if anyone else has experienced 'presences' whilst on Ecstacy. I have had one other experience where I felt a presence in a room with me. I do not remember if I sensed the nature of this presence (good or bad?), but I do remember being aware of the precise spot where this presence was standing. On this occasion also, I had taken MDMA. I wonder if the empathic qualities of E make me better able to sense this kind of stuff?
