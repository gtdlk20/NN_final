The music was quite awful.  I believe they were playing Queen when I arrived.  I don't really mind Queen but it was definitely not what I wanted to hear just then.  I went to sit with my friend, but I was feeling quite brought down by the terrible music and wasn't really in the mood to talk inanely any more.  Also I could see that my friend and her sisters weren't even drunk - they seemed obnoxiously sober and boring.  The other people in the club were even worse, they were ugly and old - celebrating the win at football by extending their beer bellies.  I longed for the edgy and exciting atmosphere at the gig or just to be around people who were on drugs too.
