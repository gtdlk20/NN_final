After chilling out at this park for awhile, Samuel asks me if we can go talk alone for a few minutes.  This was his first time taking ecstasy, however he wasn't feeling much because he only took one pill and he weighs at least 170 lbs.  He sat there on the bench and couldn't exactly come up with something to say.  Finally, he said 'I'm scared to say anything, because all these things I want to say are so emotional and meaningful, and I never let myself say things like that'.  Though he was a first time user, he still caught on to the dangers of ecstasy.  It's too easy to say something you'll regret.
