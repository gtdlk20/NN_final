I went back to the couch and remembered the lazybones joke and started laughing uncontrollably, but this time P was laughing with me. Next thing I knew I was stroking one of M's friends' arm and saying how soft it was but she didn't seem to mind. My whole body was vibrating and it felt amazing. I laughed at the slightest humorous comment. Everyone else was stoned but weren't feeling near as good as me or P.
