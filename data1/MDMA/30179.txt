Walking was really hard (probably from the molly AND from being sedentary for about 18 hours) and taking a shower was tough. I just sat under the water. Went and got breakfast and ordered bacon... Holy shit, my teeth were so sore from the grinding that the bacon was killlllllllling me. I ate about a half a pancake and was fulled up.
