All of a sudden I heard a voice, a still quiet voice, or maybe it was an intuition, a pure thought from God, I dont know, but I heard something say breathe into your heart. So this is what I did. I took deep breathes into my heart. I slowly began to recognize the difference between the heart and the mind. I slowly began to recognize the difference between the heart and the mind. The mind is the architect but the heart leads. If the mind leads it is chaotic. The heart feels the world for itself, it seeks its own reflection. The heart always leads us to love. Keep in mind that Im talking about the physical organ that is beating inside of your chest. I went outside and sat on the porch and gazed up at the trees, flooded with the Sacred Epiphany. That everything and everyone just wants to be loved, seen and appreciated. Thats it. That is the Answer to Why. History was created by the mind, but we are entering a world that will be created by the Heart. If we are led by our Heart we will experience miracles. Ive experienced many miracles in my life, and they were all in the presence of great love.
