Unfortunately I didnt enjoy the massage as much as I possibly could have because at the time I was trying to coordinate meeting up with a friend I had made online named...Gloworm. Yes, thats all I knew her by. It took a while but finally in the concession stand area I see her turquoise sweatshirt and we immediately hug each other and smile and say how nice it was to finally meet, and continue hugging. She introduces me to her friends, one of which was sucking on an ornately decorated pacifier, the other guy chatting non-stop. Theyre names were Brunho and Hack, respectively. Hack, a black gay guy probably around 20 years old, shook my head and ask me to squeeze his nipples really hard. He lifts his shirt, and as requested, I squeeze his nipples. Harder, he says, and I follow, just laughing and frying away. Gloworm keeps looking at me, saying Youre so cute, and continues hugging me. Then her friends were ready to be on their way and they start to leave, and she just keeps hugging and says Wait to her friends. We continue hugging, which felt so comforting, we look at each other and kiss on the lips for a few seconds, which also felt great. We then trade our kandi that we made specifically for each other. I show her the one I made her before I slide it onto her arm and she looks at me in the eyes and goes awww.  Then eventually her friends convince her to leave she apologizes for having to go so soon. We kiss again and then we each go on our own separate ways, happy as can be for finally having had the opportunity to meet.
