As this was happening I was noticing his face start to morph and change. First he kept going from young to elderly and back and forth. Then I started seeing full patterns develop all over his face. As if they were burned and raised into his skin, Gothic crosses all over his face. Then His eyes turned into black holes, and there were white maggots crawling all over his face. I couldn't be scared though I was too euphoric. If it was LSD, I would've been scared shit. I'm not sure what went on for a while, my eyes were rolling around hard to stay focused or open, I was fighting consciousness. And it was like as if someone snapped me out of it I would regain myself randomly.
