My mind caves inwards.  My thoughts are not racing or scattered as I had expected.  Instead I am processing thoughts slowly.  Almost molasses paced.  Maybe Im thinking fast but disconnected from time?  I cant really tell.  I dont really care; I cant really care.  Im feeling a strong disassociation between my mind, my body, and the outside world.  All three seem to be their own separate thing.  I am aware each exists, but cant connect information from one to the other in a normal or efficient fashion.
