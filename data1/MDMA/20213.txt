The side-effects began annoying me even more. I wanted to have control over my jaws, I didn't want to feel this way any more. I didn't like it. The positive effect was too artificial, the side-effect were annoying. I didn't want to feel this way any more. I didn't like it. The positive effect was too artificial, the side-effect were annoying. I started sweating, I didn't want to feel this way any more. I wanted to go home, but I didn't want to go alone, the idea freaked me out. I don't know why, I just felt that someone should take care of me if I had taken an OD.  At last, a friend of mine left the club and went home. Because he lived close to me, I could go with him. When I was home, I still had the speedy effect from the high dose of MDMA. I decided to take my bike and go. I didn't know where to, I just felt I should go. I didn't want to sleep yet.
