We stayed in the same place dancing to the music for about half an hour, I remember after the DJ that was playing stopped the music quieted down for a bit. The crowd (which seemed totally united and as one) roared so loud and my friend B turned around and looked at me in the eyes, grinning from ear to ear. I held his head and touched it with mine as we hugged. I told him - 'This is the best night of my life.' and he replied 'I know bro. I know. And it's only midnight.' As it dawned on me that we had 10 more hours of this, I felt like my happiness was unlimited (sorry if I keep repeating this).
