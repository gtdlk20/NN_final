I had been to raves two times before this. I had dressed like my friends, who had been to many more raves, in jeans and a t-shirt. This time however, I was on a mission to have the night of my life. I dressed in shorts and t-shirt and my newly aquired visor. Worn upside down and around to the side. My flatmate (dressed in her kandy outfit) and her new 26yo boyfriend (several years older than myself) both accompanied me to the rave.
