We never went to sleep; around four AM we took my friends car out on what we termed an adventure, which consisted of driving a few blocks to a park, smoking a cigarette while listening to rap music, and driving back. The 10 minutes I spent smoking and contemplating to my life was the defining moment of my night (or morning). I felt the strongest sense of purpose and self worth I have ever felt. I felt absolutely certain that the rest of my life would be amazing and unforgettable, and that I was equipped to handle any challenge I faced.
