Being with my two best friends made the trip a better one for me. I wanted to roll the first time at a big party or rave, but this experience was still worthwhile. I felt so close to everyone, and I was invincible. Nothing could go wrong, worries dissapeared. Rolling in a familiar environment and listening to trans was an experience no one could describe. IT was a nite I will never forget.
