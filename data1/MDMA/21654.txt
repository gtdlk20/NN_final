Conclusions - Well, I don't want to take one that contains meth, but I would definitely do a BD or something similar in the future. But it definitely requires vigilance. All I wanted to do on Tuesday (two days after I took it) was eat another. I have never felt so good in my life, and it would be very very easy to start taking these all the time.
