After the amazing massage I ask the girl what her name was and she said Bear. I said What? just to make sure I heard it right. Bear. Like the animal.  Oh cool!  What about yours?! My names Apollo. Nice to meet you! Isnt this awesome!!!  Then we turn around and dance some more, get more amazing massages from them. Then I ask them if they want to trade kandi. You trade kandi my holding each others hand, and then sliding your bracelet onto their arm while youre holding hands.  She replied with excitement, Yeah! Let me find a good one!  She digs through the endless number of bracelets on her arms and says Heres one with a star, because youre a star! *smiles*  And then I say This is my sisters first rave! and she looks for another piece of kandi and says to my sister Heres one with a bear claw, that way youll always remember me. Smiles everywhere. I get a text from my friends cousin who took me to my first rave...he wants to hang out. So I turn around, say It was so great meeting you guys! Have a great night! Gave them a hug. And went on our way. It felt as if we all had just instantly bonded on such a deep, profound level. As Im writing this it still blows my mind how connected this drug made me feel to these complete strangers.
