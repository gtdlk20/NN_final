It was approximately 10pm when we entered and started walking around to gain perspective on our surroundings and to find a place to post up.  I was at the bar asking for a cup of water as I felt the first effects I just felt light and ethereal, it kinda felt like I was in a negative pressure environment.  Just then M came up behind me and handed me a bottled water and I felt this sensation of pure euphoria radiate from my Mesencephalon all the way down to the distal end of my spinal cord and subsequently out through the accessory nerves and sympathetic ganglia.  I knew this was gonna be good night.  Just as Tiesto was being introduced it hit me in full force as M and I were in the crowd throwing up our hands to welcome Tiesto, everything felt so good, I felt good to throw my hands up and just move and dance around.  I dont really know how long we were there watching before we went back to the couches where J and L were clearly feeling it and probably a lot harder as they only weight about 110-115lbs each.  I talked to J and asked her if she was ok and she said yea dude I could tell by the look on her face she was peachy keen.
