The feeling of mixed euphoria/exhilaration was not an unusual feeling, except that it was continuous, as opposed to the short lasting excitement of a rollercoaster ride or similar experience. I had to leave the light in the room on, in the dark I felt like I did not have as much control over my thoughts as I did with the light. At this point, approx 30 minutes after this first 'high' feelings, I began to have hot/cold flashes, followed by shivering. It felt good to do repetitive, almost autistic movements with my hands, so I did. There were no visual distortions whatsoever. It was different than the cannabis in that for me, senses were not amplified, but I experienced everything through a window of euphoria. I went outside so I could experience it alone for a while. At that point, I was controlling the drug enough, that I'd though I'd test some effects and have a little fun.
