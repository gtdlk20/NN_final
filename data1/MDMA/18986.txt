Sarah then talked about how she had actually known I was in love with her from literally the day after I had realized it, and that she had been feeling uncomforable with me simply because she couldn't really tell when I was being her best friend or when I was being a guy who was in love with her.  She then went on to talk about how relieved she was to have heard me say this and to talk about it, becuase now we can return to our old friendship.  Over the course of the night we both felt so comfortable around each other that we were willing to be topless in front of each other and everyone.  It was not a big deal for me, but a big deal for her, she even said that she wouldn't have if I hadn't said what I had said.
