If I've learned anything from this, it's got to be don't smoke too much at one time. It's not as fun if you black out. And keep more food in the house. Munchies are bad if you have no food to eat (I think I bit someone because I was hungry). Some people say life is just a bowl of cherries - we say life is just a cherried bowl. Can't wait for my parents to go out of town again.
