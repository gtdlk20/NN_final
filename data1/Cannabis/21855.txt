For over six months I have enjoyed pot tea. I use 1/8 ounce pot and 500 milliliters of water. I bring the water to a rolling boil and boil the pot for 30 seconds. I strain it and let it cool and drink it. If I drink it all I will not drive. I usually drink 250 milliliters. I thought of adding a little corn oil or milk to bond with the thc/cannabanoids.
