Marijuana is a great drug to use, I must say, if it is used in moderation. It is a great escape from reality, something to get your mind off of things. When things are troubling me, I like to buy a gram or two, and the next couple days are spent contemplating when and where to smoke. I smoke up, and the next couple hours are a competely different world.
