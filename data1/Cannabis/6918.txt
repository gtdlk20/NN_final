By this time, I was giggling furiously, rocking in a circular motion, and vibrating all over my body. My sister continued to tell me that I was freaking out, and that I should go to bed, but my perspective on everything was altered. It was not really consciousness any longer, but almost like watching a movie. Anything I said or did seemed to come sporadically, and I was just watching. I've had the same sort of feeling before after being deprived of sleep for more than three days, but this didn't have the same fatigue involved.
