Uh oh, I thought, and she told me that the only other time she had made out with somebody when she was high ended badly, and she said that it made her have bad flashbacks.  'Flashbacks to what?'  Bad stuff, she said.  I felt like a total jackass, and I put my shirt back on and she did the same.  I started crying, overwhelmed with emotion.  I apologized for anything anyone ever did to hurt her, that she didn't deserve it.  She said that nothing I did was wrong, but I felt terrible.
