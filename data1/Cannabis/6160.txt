This really helped me control the high I was experiencing and I soon felt good enough to try and get some kind of dinner together. Nachos baked in the micro-wave seemed a good idea. Requiring only 3 ingredients, Nacho chips, salsa and cheese, I didn't think It would take the 30 minutes it took for me to gather my thoughts long enough for me to assemble the nachos. My mind was constantly distracted. I soon became fascinated by the way my arms looked hanging at my sides. If I kept my eyes straight, the look of my arms flailing around in space in my peripheral vision was a very interesting sight.
