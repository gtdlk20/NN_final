It was intense, the icy wind had turned into a raging river battering me back and forth. Yet I tried to keep my eyes closed, tried to see what the spirit of the trees had for me. I saw a circular gate and a path to it, made only of white light. On either side were many orbs of white light, and all around me were the stars. I passed through this gate and went onwards, to a green gate that was the same, but by this time the bodily high became too strong and suddenly, all motion stopped. A moment afterwards, the gate disappeared, and I was back to baseline, more or less.
