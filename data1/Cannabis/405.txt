Again I was conscious of a very loud sound that seemed to envelop me completely.  However, this wasnt the horribly oppressive klaxon of before.  Maybe it was inspired by the musical peeing.  But it seemed to me that I was surrounded by an absolutely massive choir made up entirely of sopranos (given the nature of the hallucination to come I can only speculate that they were angels).  What they sang was wordless and shrill but it did have harmony.  I cant remember most of what I saw in the water of that toilet bowl but most of it was patterns and flashes of light that I think my optic nerve is still recovering from.  Depending on the intensity of what I was seeing, the pitch of the singing would vary.  From relatively low (something that a human soprano might actually have a prayer of hitting) to almost ultrasonic.  The images got perpetually more complex and intense as the hallucination went on.  And then, for just a moment, I saw . . . God.  Not an old man on a throne, but a pattern of colors and light that was simply perfect.  I knew that nothing more complex or beautiful could possibly exist.  Ever.  I just KNEW it was God.  The image flashed away so quickly that I could almost deny that I had seen it.  But then it was BACK.  The choir was screeching such an impossibly high note in my head that I thought I would pass out.
