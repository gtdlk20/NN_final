As I continued to walk, I felt like I was not actually there. It was so incredibly strange. In my head, I knew I was just stoned and that it would wear off eventually. However, the rest of my body was in a completely different state. It felt like my mind was detached from my body, like my body knew what it was doing and I didn't have to control it. I looked up at a street sign, then down at my feet. I looked back up at the street sign, and it looked like I hadn't moved at all. I kept doing it, and it kept working until all of a sudden, I was right in front of the sign.
