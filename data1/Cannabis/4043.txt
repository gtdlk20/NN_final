Before I begin I'd like to state that I had rarely used Marijuana prior to this experience. Never more than a bowl at a time with some friends. In the days leading up to my 'trip', I had acquired a fair amount of Cannabis (more than the usual, over 12 grams), occasionally smoking a bowl with three or more friends.
