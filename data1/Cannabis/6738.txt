We started smoking, the 3 of us, but were soon joined by 2 others. My friend and I aren't tight-assed about sharing weed, as I've grown some, and it's extremely common where I live. In fact you can get lots of high potency stuff for fairly cheap. As we smoked the weed, we started joking around having fun; we were laughing A LOT at this point, and the folks by the fire, who wouldn't touch drugs with a 40 ft pole, probably started laughing at us too.
