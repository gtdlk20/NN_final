Every stimulus from the outside world conveyed a type of wonder and pure undivided happiness that I have never seen the likes of before. This utopia stoped when we reached the pools but then an hour later on the bus home I experienced the same phenomena as before to the same amazingly vivid scale. And to this day I occasionally have a glimpse into this state without any drugs and find that the world seems to have a much more wonder and beauty than it once had.
