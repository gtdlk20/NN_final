She couldn't park her car, and I made up some joke to go along with it and everytime she does a bad job parking I bring it up and we laugh about it.  Anyway, so after she parked her car, we sat in the car for another half hour just chillin out to music.  People were walking by and we were just jammin out to Phish in her car like it was our job!!  Eventually we stumbled out of the car and I was laughing histerically!  We had a hard time walking, and I couldn't talk too well.  Basically, we were just a little slow.  We noticed that we would be in mid-sentence and lose all train of thought and couldn't continue on with our story!
