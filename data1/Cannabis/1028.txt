When we got in my car, I contemplated how driving high was way safer than driving drunk, as one's coordination is generally not effected as much by THC as by alcohol. Was I about to be proven wrong! Once I pulled on to the main road, I realized that I was entirely too impaired to drive. My senses were delayed, so that when I made any movement, like turning the steering wheel, I couldn't feel it, only see it, until a couple seconds after. Everything seemed much closer to me than it was, and sounds seemed extremely loud and reverberate. Realizing this, I pulled over into an empty parking lot, but A didn't feel comfortable because he had marijuana on him, so I reluctantly (and irresponsibly) decided to go ahead and drive the rest of the way. I took back roads so as to avoid traffic, and after what seemed like hours, made it to my girlfriend's restaurant in one piece.
