So all of the aforementioned effects are taking place in the middle of a mountain range trail, when it is getting pretty dark out, so we decide to go for a walk down one of the paths. I ask J if he is feeling the paper doll effect, and he says no. S says that J doesn't usually get very high when he uses it, and K said that he wasn't as up as I was either. S usually feels higher when she uses cannabis with me, most likely because I am a really goofy guy when I am under the influence of it, and it rubs off on her and makes her feel a little more loosened up.
