Two particular things stand out on memory, 1) getting a dizzy feeling almost making me fall down when in the restroom which seemed half the size of a phone booth and scary because it didn't provide relief from the constant 'airplane noise' that was powerful and 2) talking with a beautiful Dutch flight attendant (I mean the MOST beautiful woman) who convinced me to try taking a sip of cognac after my meal because it was a custom on this KLM flight. I had just started to relax a little after eating (which seems to happen when tripping) and when I swallowed (a BIG sip - stupid) of this strong brandy or whatever it was, my head felt like it exploded! The pretty woman just smiled at me and probably thought how silly I looked and was for digesting so much hash and having to suffer on this airplane trip.
