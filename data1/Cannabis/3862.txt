I realized that I had become a mushroom completely, and my thoughts and consciousness took the shape of a mushroom cap. Every little leaf or page in the cap was one of my thoughts, one of my realities. I was simultaneously experiencing those realities, but I was also the observer, and could see each reality in the tiniest detail, and yet I was there too. I was there in the bath, but also at home with my parents, but also at work tomorrow, and also in the dream I had a few nights ago. I knew instinctively that there were an infinite amount of these realities, and given the time and effort who knew what I could uncover, but at that time I only had the energy/capacity to focus on 5 or 6 of those realities. Still, it was enough, and it was mind-blowing. Later my sister pointed out to me that in that moment I had Stopped time Carlos Castaneda style. I dont know about that, but it certainly fits the bill. Time and space really ceased to have any meaning or to exist at all.
