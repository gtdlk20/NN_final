7:00 PM: I arrive home, I don't know how, but I'm here. My parents are sitting on the couch and I'm trying as hard as I can to look sober because I've got to get a job interview done soon. I can't worry about that now, so I go up to my bedroom and just listen to music. I find that everything sounds a lot better than they usually do, and stuff is a whole lot cooler to watch. I could do this every day all day..
