We kept hearing cars coming and as we both commented, we were both excited when we heard each car, in fact so excited, before we realized it was not our ride. We would SEE the fucking car (A little red 97' Eclipse) until we realized it was not him. We believed it was a conspiracy and that the same people were driving in circles just messing with us. A family with kids came to the park. I mean it was not obvious at all, NO WAY, I mean, you have two kids, blasted out of their own reality staring off into nothing sitting on a park bench. I'm willing to bet any money that this family thought we were heroin addicts and that they were telling their kids to stay away from people like us. This 'high' at this point was frightening and not too much fun. The car came.
