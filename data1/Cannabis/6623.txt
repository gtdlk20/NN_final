After the arrival, we sat about for a while, jammed a bit, discussed some song possibilities and all the normal shit that I forget after the wave has left every part of my body soaked while the land around me dries up into a vast desert. Then one of my friends invites me to a part of the house that's safe, I know what's going on, he knows what's going on, and he knows that I know what's going on. All is cool.
