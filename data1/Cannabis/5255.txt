Ten minutes from the first hit and I'm feeling 'it'. I walked to my computer to listen to the opera tune. I thought to myself 'I'm high' and the biggest grin came to my face. Coming up was excellent, didn't just feel high, I felt that I was becoming high. A smooth, rich transition from normal to intoxication. As a matter of fact, intoxication is probably a bad word to describe this high. I'm going to call it ineuphorication from now on. Toxic is an ugly word for marijuana.
