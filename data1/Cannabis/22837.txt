Preparation included filling the kitchen sink with water, and cutting/burning a hole in the bottle cap so as to insert the bowl on top of it. These activites took longer than anticipated, so we smoked a bowl using a regular pipe as we waited. When everything was ready, we inserted the packed bowl into the bottle cap hole, heated it with a lighter to seal it, and set up the bottle in the sink, w/the cap on top.
