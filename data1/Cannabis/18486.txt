By now, we all knew we weren't going to roll at all, and started to watch movies. It was something like 5:30 all of a sudden, the sun was up, and we were all pissed about the bunk pills. BMF ensured us that things would be taken care of and we would either get the money back for the pills or we'd get new ones to replace those. This made us all happy. We then began to watch Hackers, and about halfway through, I went to go join BMF on the trampoline to just lie there. We talked about how it was really pretty outside and smoked a few bowls to further enjoy it. I then went back inside, caught the end of the movie, and sat there while Ox selected Eyes Wide Shut for out next DVD. By now Raz was in a back room, BMF was still outside, and Spin was sleeping for work. Ox, Sicily, and myself were going to watch the movie.
