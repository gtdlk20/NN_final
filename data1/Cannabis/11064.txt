But it wasn't till my first 4/20 that I was truly introduced to the wonders of weed. It was April 20th and nearly everyone was celebrating it. I drove my boyfriend, at the time, and his friend out of the city limits to the top of a hill in the country. I was still 15 and didn't even have a learner's permit yet so it was pretty risky. There, my boyfriend rolled a nice fat blunt for us to smoke.
