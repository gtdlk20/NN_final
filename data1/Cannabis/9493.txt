I check my phone and that entire experience I thought must have taken at least 15-20 minutes was in fact 2 minutes. I remained in the toilet for the next 20 mins completely stoned listening to music and calming down before leaving for class. I make my excuses and sit down trying not to giggle from my friends laughing at my obvious still high state.
