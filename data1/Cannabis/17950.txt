I felt so far away from my home, like I would never get back. I go back to the club and walk in thinking I can pretend they wont notice me, but they push me out again. Some people come out of the club and I go up to a couple, drawn by the beauty of the guy. I tell him he is beautiful and reach to feel his hair, then I turn to his girlfriend and say, You are not good enough for him.(!) And she replies, Well, I am glad you feel that way. Wow!
