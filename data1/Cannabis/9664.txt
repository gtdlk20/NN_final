CONCLUSIONS - It's obvious that THC is not going to do the same job as classic psychedelics, despite some similarities in the effects. There are two problems. First, THC is unpredictable. I've since experimented with the green dragon a bit more, and the line between a good time and a scary time (or a good time and nothing) is one huge biological blur. Second, the experience is shallow. A dose of tryptamines can yield a rough experience, but there's a catharsis when the primary effects wear off; THC just makes me feel high.
