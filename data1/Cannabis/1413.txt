I met up with three of my close friends after class and bought a dime off of a friends neighbor. Wed smoked their weed before and generally agreed that this dealer had decent marijuana. The last time I smoked the marijuana we scored from this dealer I felt relaxed and experienced a normal high. Last night I went on an unexpected, horrifying trip to the base of reality and the core of truth.
