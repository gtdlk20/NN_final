At about 8 oclock, it was almost time for me to get picked up by my mom, so me and S went back to her house. I then made plans to go see my girlfriend, who lived nearby, before I went home. I showed up at her house about 8:30, I was coming down quite a bit, and I could now concentrate pretty well on what I was doing. I got to her house, spent a few minutes with her, and then had to go back to Ss house. Almost as soon as I got there, my mom arrived, so I gathered my things from S, and got in my moms car. We talked about random things on the way home, I had no problem with conversation at all, and any deviation from normal behavior wasnt noticed, because I often act strangely when Im sober. I got back to my house, and spent a couple hours on my computer, talking to S, and recapping the days events. I went to bed, feeling perfectly content. All in all, it had been an extremely fun day, and one of many good DXM experiences Ive had. It just goes to show that responsible and educated use of DXM can yield amazing results.
