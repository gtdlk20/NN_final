Of course, we laughed so hard that we all had tears in our eyes, but the overall mood was extremely mellow and peaceful. I never once had the 'munchies', but I was extremely thirsty. But, I had never felt so at ease. And, while high, I learned that I was just like the people I was against... the people that judged by the outside and didn't care what the inside was about. So, I decided to change it. And I have. I learned that we're all one, we are all equal, and violence and war only causes more problems. I saw the world from a completely differend point of view. I was no longer interested in what people thought of me, I was interested in standing up and having a voice.
