I'll start with probably the simplest thing to explain - flying :D. At the very beginning, sitting down (BEST position for tripping) my head was REALLY heavy, yet I was floating. This ain't notin like flying tho! Lets move to third person camera. He's sitting, eyes just fully closed while head tilted down and back bent down. Slowly his head tilts up and back with it, smile widening, eyebrows raising, laughing like he's on one a ride at a theme park. He looks like a damn fewl. hehe.
