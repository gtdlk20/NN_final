Well, last night I discovered why those sentiments are often the precursor to that person holding their head between their knees and asking me if theyre going to die for four hours straight. Often times theres a prolonged gestation period when one starts out feeling absolutely nothing or only a very light sense of awesome. The problem is that at that point hubris kicks in and they either get disappointed (which may lead to a negative mindset), or god forbid demand to eat more. And then in about an hour or two the other shoe drops. Mary Janes shoe. And she drops that shoe on that ass for the rest of the night.
