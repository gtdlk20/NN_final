Six days ago, an average Friday, around 5:30P, I took my two Jack Russell terriers out for the typical afternoon walk and to catch a quick buzz. I fire up freshly rolled J from stash of average Carolina Roadside and took a few (4-6) decent hits and headed back to the house. I popped open a beer and ask my wife what the evening agenda was. We decided to take a short ride to scout out Saturday yard sale locations.
