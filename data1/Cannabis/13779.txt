On a second occasion, I again went to a party with a couple of friends. This time, there were couches in the dancehall itself, which was nice. I was extremely stoned, and sat in one of the couches, watching the people dance. At a certain point however, I noticed that I couldnt move my neck anymore. No matter how hard I tried, it wouldnt move. I could only loosen it up by tilting my head, but otherwise, it wouldnt move. This lasted until I got up and danced. I suspect the feeling of not being able to move my neck was because I was wearing a turtleneck sweater (I believe that's what's it called). So my neck was kind of 'locked up' in there. Anyway, this was a pretty strange experience, although at the time I didnt mind it, I even thought it was pretty funny.
