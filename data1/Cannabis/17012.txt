My friend turned on some bob marley and I was immediatly transformed into a different world.  The music seamed to slow and speed up growing in my wonder. I felt part of the music like when I moved my head I was keeping up with the slow bobbing of the notes.The music seamed to bend I was truely struck by the wonder of it all.  The music seamed to fade into the backround and I was sitting on the bad.  I began to stare at the digital clock and it seamed to be blinking at me.  I then became deep in thought about my life and how I needed to change, and how good I really did have it.  I didnt realize I had been staring at this clock for 13 min till my friend smacked me.  This is when I became nervous, and I believe my high peaked, about an hour after we started smoking. I felt like I was trapped and I needed out.  I strained to feel normal and I found that with little effort I could.  This reasured me that I wasnt that far out of my 'world'.  After several min of making myself 'normal' I realized I was wasting the trip.  The beautiful colors were still all around, and as I focused in on some mellow 311 tunes and closed my eyes the greens and purples that was blinking before now seamed to be waving to me in a very soothing manner.  I tried to thank God for the wonderful expierence and hoped it would never end.  I was getting tired and my head seamed strained by the trip, if you can call it that.  I laid down thinkin of my life floating in and out of the 'real world' and my alternate world on marijuana.  I passed out around 3:45
