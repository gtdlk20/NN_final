8.34 - Still stoned. I am starting to begin to come down, but it is slow and gradual. Time seems to flow slowly. I am feeling alright as so many smokers before me have said. I for some reason feel as though smoking has brightened and improved my life, rather than acting in a negative, dirty way as I might unfortunately consider while not high. At the moment, I feel happy, content, and sleepy. I wish nothing more than to pass out on my bed, but I feel dedicated to staying awake to further my study. All colours currently associated with nature. I am now filled with fear, as I see a blue light entering my room. I rush to the window, expecting to see an officer to arrest me, and see nothing. So I lock my door and turn down the music.
