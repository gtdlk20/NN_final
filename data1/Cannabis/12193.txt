I will never forget this experience. The way the song looked and felt is still extremely clear in my mind when I recall the memory. I often play the song while high to this day, though I don't let myself get too carried away, because the intensity of what happened wasn't in any way unpleasant, but probably too intense for me to handle. I have had similar experiences with a few other songs (mostly techno), though they haven't been as intense. I tried to draw a picture of what it looked like, but unfortunately it proved difficult to give it the proper detail without showing how it moved.
