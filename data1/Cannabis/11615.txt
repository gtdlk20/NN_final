It felt great to be walking, like it took no energy at all, or maybe like I just had plenty of energy to spare. I don't get out much, so normally I get sore before long. The 'pain' in my hips that was slowly rising after a few hours of walking actually felt kind of good. This could have been some sort of interaction with the amitriptyline, as another use for it is a low to medium strength pain killer and CNS depressant.
