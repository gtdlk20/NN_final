Next thing I know Nivette and I are kissing against a chain link fence. My phone still open as Ezra listens to me kissing and breathing, Ohh this is soo nice. Nivette brings me up against a small tree or parking meter, I slide down it as she feels me up. People are walking down the sidewalk, couples hand in hand, amazed to find two women making out on the ground. Her hands moving over my smooth dress, my breasts, between my legs. Then I look up at peoples stares of amazement, and realize what is happening, Whoah, what is going on. I get up and walk down the street with the lighter, ¼ of a joint and my phone still open.
