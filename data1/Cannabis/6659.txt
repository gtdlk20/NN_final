My vision darted to every tiny thing in the room and focused on it for what I thought could be maybe just seconds but were possibly hours. This uncertainty of time made me self-conscious for some reason and I feared how my reaction could appear to those outside of my world. Suddenly, and unexpectedly, I noticed my friends laughing and pointing at me. It was like a jump in time to this occuring and they started to transform into these odd bird/dargon/lizard creatures. It was at this point that I felt entirely isolated in another realm and set apart from everything else but still somehow able to see everyone and hear them on some level. But no longer were we in the same place.
