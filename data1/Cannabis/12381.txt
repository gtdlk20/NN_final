I am a professional singer with repertoire ranging from Oasis to opera, Mozart to musicals. I have been performing for nearly ten years, starring in numerous productions, as well as being the recipient of many prizes, awards, and scholarships from a plethora of competitions. I currently study classical singing with the recognized best teacher in the city where I reside. I also smoke marijuana approximately once a week, and have been doing this for almost three years. I would like to comment on the relationship between these two activities, in an attempt to allow other singers to understand some of the pros and cons of the effects of smoking marijuana on their vocal abilities. If I use any technical jargon which confuses a reader, I apologize in advance and suggest that the viewer use a reputable voice site to seek a definition.
