I do not suggest driving, swimming, cycling, or doing anything that could be dangerous, while you are high.  I find I lose a lot of control over my muscles, and can hardly move.  The main effect is the laughter, and the blank feeling.  You feel like you are not in your body, you feel like you are sleeping, dreaming.  It is an amazing feeling.  The whole high, for me, lasted for about one to one and a half hours.  I cant remember exactly.  I think that if I had smoked much more, I would have been completely incapacitated.  As it was, I could hardly move.  I think it is impossible to overdose on marijuana, but you can certainly make yourself throw up a lot, I know.  I dont suggest smoking to the point that you cant think at all.  I have seen people who, when high, cant walk, and crawl instead.  A friend of mine crawled about three miles.  It took him a number of hours.  He doesnt remember any of it.
