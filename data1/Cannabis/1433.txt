9:55pm: We get to my friends house and I tell her if Im not better in the morning to please not let me continue to live that way. She was terrified, but she was trying not to show it because she didnt want me to freak out completely. At this point I sat up in her bed for hours and just experienced the thought loop because I knew I was unable to control it. I realized after a while that it might help to count from one to ten to try and keep track of time, because I was thinking too quickly. This seemed to help, but then I would realize that I zoned off again not long after reaching the number ten. When my thoughts did begin to slow down, I felt an overwhelming sense of normalcy.  My thoughts were in sync with time for brief periods and I could feel this.
