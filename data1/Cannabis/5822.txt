Keeping my eyes open became too much of an effort and too much of a mind trip, so I closed them and realized that the effect was fading. I was happy but at the same time a little sorry that I had to leave my little universes. As the scary feelings wore off, I realized that I was completely at peace with everything. I saw a vision of myself lying naked in the middle of a desert, gazing up at a sapphire sky, completely at peace.
