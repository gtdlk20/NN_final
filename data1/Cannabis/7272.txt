We wandered out of the cabin totally stoned and filled with an invigorating sense of adventure.  I felt as though I was embarking on some spiritual quest, but I was fuled by the prospect of humor and adventure.  After a lot of walking, we came to a field which C insisted had numerous cows.  It was much too dark to tell at this point, and a flashlight wasn't doing us much good.  So we split up and began walking around the field.  It was huge and we all kept up communication with each other.  'Any cows?' someone would ask 'Nope, none yet' someone else would reply.  I felt a huge surge of energy and zest for fun while doing all this.  The cool and moist blades of grass brushing my legs felt marvelous.  Matched with the coolness and freshness of the breeze, I was in nirvana.
