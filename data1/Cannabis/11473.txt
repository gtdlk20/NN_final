As I walked out of the woods the plants around me seemed to mix together; as if I had been walking through a giant green painting.  I walked out of the woods and saw the concrete parking lot around me.  My vision was hazy and weird, sort of like a TV channel with very poor reception.  I had a hard time figuring out exactly where I was, and felt as if I had entered into a lucid dream.
