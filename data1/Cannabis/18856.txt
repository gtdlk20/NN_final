I got a call from my friend one night, lets call her Betty Sue. She called to say that she was over at her Neighbor's (Sue Bee) House. Se told me to have my mom drop me off immideately. I could smell a good amount of almost sweet marijuana at the doorway. My mom didn't smell it. I sat down in the house and had one small hit from the bammer filled joint Betty Sue was smoking. it was definitetely not enough to have any  sort of effect, but it was the kind I could stay  up all night smoking for a good alert buzz if I had enough. We went out to get some food and shared a few more hits of bammer. By this time, the bammer wasn't having any psychoactive effect, but I could feel cottonmouth coming on, so I at least knew that when we smoked enough, there would be a pleasant mild high that I could enjoy.
