I first found when I was like 13 or 14 that my mom smoked weed. At this point in my life I only thought bad of it, as I had only heard of the bad sides that it was real bad for you, it's highly addictive, blah blah blah youre gonna die if you smoke it. Ever. Youll wake up a coke head, shit like that.
