I took a few big hits off that joint in about one minute and then started coughing violently, I apparently had taken good hits. I was coughing uncontrollably for about a minute. My brother asked me if I was good to drive my car back home, I said no. I was definitely in a different state of consciousness now. Everything was more meaningful, and my mind dwelt on everything a little longer. I was also ignoring a lot of stimulus and focusing on what caught my attention. This was all in addition to the extremely slow perception of everything happening I had already mentioned.
