Despite the fact that the music wasn't standing still, i managed to read through the hymns and solo ok and book it the hell out.  Came home, had an apple, passed out on my bed.  This was at about 12:30 pm the next day, now T+19 or so.  i was asleep until 12:00 am, T+31 or so, and i was still high when i woke up.  i ate some munchies and staggered back to bed again.  woke up at 8:30 am, 38 hours after ingestion, still a little dazed, a little depressed, but at least functional again.
