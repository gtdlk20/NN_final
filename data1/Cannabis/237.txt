That Don't take Drugs lecturer at Helen's school was right about it being stronger than it used to be.  The high hasn't changed that much.  You just get there on fewer hits.  I wonder if it's because of the Sinsimilla revolution?  Back in the old days most good pot had tons of seeds.  The more loaded with seeds the greater the concentration of bud.  Yes, we smoked the leaves too.  We weren't a bunch of pot farming connoisseurs back then, we were mostly middle class suburban white kids.  The Internet hadn't been invented yet.  When we talked about different kinds of pot, we identified it by what country it came from, not which plant family.  And we sneered at most home grown.  Good pot was mostly believed to have come from Acapulco, Jamaica or Colombia (of course the little plastic sandwich baggies came from the grocery store so we didn't really know where it came from).  Wheww!  It seems Like I just had a Grampa Simpson moment  just now.  OK, I'm not trying to speak for a generation, I'm just relating my impressions of suburban drug culture in New England in the 70s.  I think I turned on for the first time in 1969 just like most folks on the east coast.  It didn't seem to matter how old you were in 1969 (I was fourteen). That was just the year when the counter culture tidal wave reached the east coast.
