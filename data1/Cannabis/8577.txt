Then I noticed that when I would touch anything, it would feel so so different. I could feel every nerve ending in my body. There was no such thing as pain. Pain is a feeling interpreted by your brain, and I couldn't control my brain! Everything I touched felt the same. There was really no such thing as texture; I just had the same intense feeling when I touched everything. So I started rubbing my body and my arms especially against everything around me: the walls, pillows, even my friends. This feeling lasted for hours, and I can still feel part of it now, a day later!
