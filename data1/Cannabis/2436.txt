My eyes move real slow--like when I'm drunk, except that everything has a weird view to it, like I'm looking through a bubble out into the world, and the edges are blurred. I'm studying everyone, paying little attention to Michael, which is odd, because he was most of the reason for me joining this little excursion in the first place. I was still depressed from when he broke up with me the week before and I needed to 'sort out' all of the feelings pent up inside before I drove myself mad from running in metaphorical circles. And I needed to figure out how to not feel so awkward around him, and this seemed like a good path to try out.
