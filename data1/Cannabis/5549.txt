1:15 AM- J is getting ready to leave so I will have to leave soon.  I talk with his brother and secretly begin getting very anxious and slightly confused, but IÂ’m having a good time, none the less.  Speaking of time, it has slowed WAAAAAAAAAY down at this point.  5 minutes seems like 30 minutes easily.  This time dialation is not as noticable as it is on mushrooms, but still, it is there.
