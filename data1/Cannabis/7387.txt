It was another Friday evening, and as usual I was hanging out at my friend T's house. I'd spent most of the evening listening to music and watching anime with this other dude. Basically chilling out. Then I see Nos online, and he says he's coming over then we'll go get some weed and just hang out (like we always do at Ts, no one's ever there to bother us). Tonight however, we were in for a bit of a treat. Dingo knew one of the dealers and we got hooked up with about 2 grams of JA, which is a fairly potent strain of Jamaican weed we get here in the Caribbean.
