My ceiling in my room is textured, not smooth, and this served as an origin point for my most intense visuals. Lights on, lying on my back, my ceiling blossomed into a wave of shifting patterns, which grew quite intense at times. I would compare this to a low dose of psilocybin mushrooms. I also saw small pinpoints of bright, neon-coloured lights within the patterns. Upon turning my gaze to my walls and artwork on them, the patterns spread to there too, with similar intensity. In fact, things seemed to actually move slightly. With effort, I found that I could concentrate and make my visuals dissipate for a few moments. After about an hour of this and idle discussion, we eventually decided to sleep.
