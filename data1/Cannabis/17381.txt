5:00 PM: We arrive at said dealer's household with a large rust-red volkswagon bus with hippie stickers all over it, and flowers popping about here and there in the garden. S and I wait in the car while H goes in to get the weed. About 10 minutes later, H comes back and the smell of mint/skunk immediately fills my nostrils as I move up to see what she's got. Holy shit, this stuff smells so fucking good. Cousin H unwraps the magazine page and reveals the most beautiful marijuana that I had ever been blessed in my entire life to see. Absolutely fucking beautiful weed;  some real top notch stuff. S and I smile at H as she wraps it back up and we set off back home.
