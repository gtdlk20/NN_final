Mentally, I was fucked up right from the start. Silly, rambling, less inhibition, suggestable, prone to irrational fears and crazy ideas, prone to mindless giggling fits  I laughed hysterically at Bruce McCullochs The Biggest Crouton I Ever Saw (well its pretty damn funny when sober, but HILARIOUS when stoned). The out-of-body analgesic effects and time dilation (which I believe are closely related, the former causing the latter) were strong from the start. I felt entirely out-of-control and that was a little disturbing. Jitteriness came and went. I spent the next hour alternating between lying on the couch and typing my rambling thoughts on J.s computer with a manic drive. I listened to some music: The Diva soundtrack, my own compositions from MP3.com, and some Liszt I downloaded from AudioGalaxy  I couldnt concentrate for very long, and it sounded tinny and distant (although that was probably because of the crappy speakers).
