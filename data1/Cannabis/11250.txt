Within minutes of sitting down I felt this intense omniscience. There were multiple conversations going on in the table and I was locked into each one.  I was having a difficult time ascertaining social cues. The conversation across the table, was it ok to interrupt.  A murmur of Hindi emanated from the adjacent kitchen, a most comforting sound.  Other sounds of India (barking dogs, car horns, the call to prayer from the local mosque) invaded my consciousness.
