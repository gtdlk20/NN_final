The first thing I noticed besides the usual light-headedness was that the scene in the distance, which was a few other buildings and a streetlight or two, seemed to have the qualities of a Thomas Kincaid painting  sparkles of light that just melt perfectly into the surrounding area  mixed with the qualities of a Maxfield Parish painting  smooth textures on everything, broad brushstrokes  especially the sky.  Everything looked painted.  Now I wasnt really worried at this point.  Ive had minor hallucinations like this before while smoking weed  especially at night.  This one would probably qualify as the most pronounced of those minor hallucinations but it was still nothing that really set off alarms in my head.  Mike went inside sometime during all this in order to get us some water  as everybody knows joints are a little hard on the throat (I would later learn that he was already experiencing some pretty intense hallucinations).  When he didnt return after a while, Rick and I decided we would go back inside.  I was feeling the weed very strongly as we reentered the building and I muttered something about how I was going to go up to the drinking fountain.  I weaved my way down the hall, my vision swimming, but thankfully not spinning.
