I began to feel it right away. Everything was beautiful! The sun, the fields and the trees, everything. The melting snow added even more to the effect, as it's rays warmed me in a an undescribable way. I usually get paranoid about seeing other people who aren't 'cool' while high, but not now. I was very talkative and happy to be around anyone. But everyone was busy riding horses, so I layed on a bench, put my IPOD on random mode, and took a mini-vacation. I literally traveled through that blue, infinite sky that day. There literally wasn't a cloud in sight. I saw an over flying air plane while some reggae song played, and I felt like I was back in the Carribean, just loving life. Now here comes the most amazing part (to me, anyway). My IPOD WAS OFF, and 'I get by with a little help from my friends' by the Beatles was playing. I DON'T EVEN HAVE THIS SONG ON MY IPOD! I just kept looking at the sky in total amazement. I felt like I was flying, and the song actually made sense. I don't know how I 'played' the song in my head from memory, because I never have owned or listened to the Sgt. Pepper album, with the exception of the songs Sgt Pepper and 'LSD'. The hallucinations I had were of the Sgt Pepper cartoon as well, which, I have also never seen indepth, but only in fragments from commercials. What was my mind trying to tell me? To love life, and every damn second of it at that. Life is too short, and thats the bottom line. Its experiences like this that reaffirm my faith in an almighty power, and the concept of Carpe Diem. I wish everyone could experience what I did that day. But alas, not all things come to be. I just hope my story has given some insight to those who wonder about the reasons why people smoke marijuana. This is just one example, but there are many more. Enjoy, and be excellent to each other.
