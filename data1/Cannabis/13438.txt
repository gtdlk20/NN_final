I boiled up some milk, and chopped up a few small chunks of the bud into finer smaller bits and threw it in.  I kept it boiling for well over half an hour, thinking that it might take quite abit of heat to release the THC properly.  Well it was definately not as 'smell-free' as I thought it would be.  Oh well, I thought.. weed had just recently been decriminilized where I live so I didnt have to worry much.  I drank the milk/weed.  Didn't feel anything for half an hour, so I brought out the blades...
