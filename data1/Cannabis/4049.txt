T+0:00: I lit up right at 12:10 and took the biggest hit of the day right off the bat. About halfway through our session friends A and B were passing every other hit, so it was me and Friend C who were getting most of the green. On top of that I was the only one who didn't smoke just about every day, and the only one taking really big hits. It took us about 10 minutes to get to the roach, and when we finished we walked back to the school and sat down on a bench to eat lunch.
