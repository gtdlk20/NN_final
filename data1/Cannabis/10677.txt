About fifteen or twenty minutes after we had finished smoking, I noticed that I was quite incredibly baked. Probably more baked than I had ever been before. Much more body high than I had ever felt before, too. My legs were warm and tingling very comfortably, and there was a nice sensation all throughout my body. We laughed at some stuff on the computer, and had some weird conversations, including a discussion on the effects of warm or cold water on guitar playing ability. *shrug*
