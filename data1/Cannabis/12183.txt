It wasn't until about 8 months ago that I started smoking weed. It was never really anything that I didn't want to do, or thought was wrong, it just wasn't something that was high on my list of priorities. The first few times I got high, I did enjoy myself, but I didn't really get to thoroughly enjoy myself because it just so happens that I become very antisocial while high, and those times I smoked, I was around a lot of people, which made me nervous and paranoid. This was especially intensified by the fact that it doesn't take much at all to get me very high.
