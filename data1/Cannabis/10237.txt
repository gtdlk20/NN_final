We switched out and she drove. Within five minutes we were home. I was flippin. It felt like a total freak out. For lack of better description, I told my wife I was buggin. And I was - severely. I struggled to get out of the car. As I made it towards the house, I could barely walk. My heart was thumping like a Maserati. I thought it might be a heart attack and it took all my wits not to pass out.
