I have tried weed since, and stopped after a couple of tokes because I could feel myself falling into the trap again.  I dont think the weed was having any effect on me at all (I hadnt had much at all), it was just the fear of it happening again that brought it back.  Once I realised that, I was OK.  I dont like going into my own world too much any more, but its important to know that it doesnt matter if I do.  Its sort of like quicksand.  If the only thing I concentrate on is getting the hell out of it, Ill sink further.  But if I just let it happen, chances are Ill be OK.  I know now that if I do have a panic attack, I have the power to pull myself out of it.  Its just something that can happen to people; weed or not.
