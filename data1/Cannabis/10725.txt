I live where Marijuana is now legal, and had been dabbling with purchasing in stores. I had quite a stash of different strains, and was waiting for the right setting to fully allow a good ol 70's buzz. I had not smoked for.....well, a long time if you check my age. Back in the day I would tear it up, but had not used as I got older. Now was my chance!
