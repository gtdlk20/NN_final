Benny giggles and I could see the cop's large nose through my eyelids. He begins to open the door and then remembers to shut off the car, saying 'whoopsies' and turning it on and off again, laughing at the noise. My heart pounds loud in my ears and I go all tense and shaky, filled with so many different emotions--panic overriding them all. The muscle is pulling at the constraints of my sternum, trying to fight its way out.
