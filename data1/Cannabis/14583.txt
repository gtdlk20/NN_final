On this particular day, my friends' and I had retired to their bedroom to partake in our bong-hitting ritual.  My binger was set up first and I noticed right off the bat that it was a significantly smaller bowl then I was usually offered.  In fact, it seemed to be one, maybe just two hits of weed at the most.  But, I reminded myself, it wasn't my weed and my friends are by no means ungracious hosts, so I took the proffered bong and promptly lit it up without complaints.  I filled the chamber of the bong with about the amount of smoke I usually like to take in on one hit and sucked it down.
