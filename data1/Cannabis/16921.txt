On top of this my mind would switch from that to basically conjuring up an image in my head of my heart and brain arguing and fighting. My mind as I remember was just belittling my heart at every turn, constantly mocking its ideas, hopes and dreams, always finding reasons why they wouldn't work. Eventually I got up and got a drink. This halted the argument and torment for a while. Not long after I sat back down again, the argument continued, albeit less intensely (this was most likely the beginning of the come-down period). I began to kind of ignore it and focus on the YouTube videos I was watching. Around 0:00 or 0100 the heightened imagination had gone and I was left with the munchies and an almost blank mind, similar to being drunk, just without the nausea and discomfort.
