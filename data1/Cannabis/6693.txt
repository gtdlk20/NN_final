I was convinced eventually to just lay down and drink some water. My friends let me be for a while, something that I had wanted at that time. Every now and then one or the other would come back to check on my condition and try to get information from me as to how I was doing but it just wouldn't vocalize yet. I remember feeling very scared, abandoned, and fearful whenever they would leave after that.
