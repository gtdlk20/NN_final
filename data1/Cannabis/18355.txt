My friend G, the depression guy, got higher than any of us. He also gets depressed when really high. He went home and decided to take two bottles of tylenol, 48 pills. I woke from a deep slumber to G's roomate calling and wanting to know if G took any acid or shrooms or anything, because G was puking red and delirious. I said get him to a hospital fast, and found out about the whole incident the next day.
