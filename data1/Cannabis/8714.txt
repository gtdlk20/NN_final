My final verdict: The 3 thimble sized bowls I smoked didn't even seem like a lot at all but they kept me high for at least 5 hours. I felt like there were sparkles of glitter flying around my head for most of the time and the hula/starry head thing was fun. I felt immensely relaxed, but it was easy to stay awake and enjoy the sensation. When I did go to sleep after the high had worn off, I felt almost like I was a corpse I slept so heavily.
