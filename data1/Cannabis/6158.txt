My thoughts soon drifted back to my original feelings of dread and I began to feel scared and alone once again, not sure if I would come out of this experience unscathed or not. I stood in the door way of my room for 5 or so minutes, not being able to make up my mind to turn out the lights in my room and lie under the blanket, or to try and watch tv and let these horrible few minutes pass. Eventually common sense prevailed and I went out to my living room to watch TV. Although I don't remember what was on I believe it was of the comedy qenre and it was fucking, fucking funny. I laughed till I could laugh no more.
