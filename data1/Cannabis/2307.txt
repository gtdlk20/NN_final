Having turned off the shower and dried myself off, I left the bathroom, but left the window open and the fan on. I walked to my room, got dressed, and contemplated what to do next. IÂ’d planned on watching a dvd on my laptop, but I was consumed by an inexplicable hunger that was 20 times stronger than any of my previous hungers while high. I had a fruit-by-the-foot and a square of chocolate at hand, and I ate them so fast I had to stop myself in the middle from spitting flecks of food all over.
