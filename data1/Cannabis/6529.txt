What has not been explained in these series of events was how my reaction was different to those of the other kids with me. Everyone else seemed calm, and their remarks at least slightly intelligent, they were able to hold conversations. For me, I experienced constant confusion, and mild visual and auditory hallucinations. This was after only 3 hits. So far both my smoking experiences have left me as the 'event of the night', with everyone talking about my actions and remarks. In the end, I am completely embarassed by my actions and would prefer to smoke alone and be left to my abstract thoughts.
