After this I began to lose focus and feel very tired Â– it had been a really heavy trip after all. I went to lie down in my bed and pleasantly drifted between waking and dreaming until I drifted off to sleep. The total trip lasted about 5 or 6 hours. I felt fine the next day, a bit spacey, but nothing unusual.
