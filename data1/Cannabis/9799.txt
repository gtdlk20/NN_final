Without changing or brushing my teeth or even taking my socks off, I collapsed into bed. 19 hours later, I woke up. My stomach was hurting because I hadn't eaten anything in about 2 days. I was dehydrated and immedietly brought myself to the kitchen and drank a liter of water. After I showered and got dressed I closed the curtains and drank tea till I felt better.
