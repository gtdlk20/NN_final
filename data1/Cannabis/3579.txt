With the new stuff, I shifted gears and started trying to learn to vape. First I tried the Pax Era Legion of Bloom Lavendar, hitting it, then waiting, then hitting it again. I found it pretty harsh, and mostly just coughed a lot. I didn't feel much. A different day I tried the absolute extracts OG Kush. I liked the lighter draw, but still coughed alot. After a couple hits, I felt a little something, but not much.
