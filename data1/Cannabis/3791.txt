12:10 PM (T+01:10)- I met up with my cousin at the lake, which is a short walk from my house. The day was great and the two of us set off on my boat, heading towards a beach across the lake. At this point I was totally twisted. My entire body pulsed with feeling and everything I touched felt alive. If my boat's design had featured a radio, I'm sure I would have gotten lost in the tunes and crashed. It was terrible. It was beautiful. We crossed the lake safely and went ashore on the beach. My dog trotted off and into the water, trying to cool off her dark fir by diving in the water. As long as I keep an eye on her, I thought, She'll be a good dog. Mistake # 4.
