The high is not an ecstasy high.  It does not help you discover yourself, nor does it help you solve problems.  Weed is not something to be used for depression, as after you are done, the effects are gone, completely, other than the memories.  You will not feel like a god, or a better person.  You will simply have laughed a lot.
