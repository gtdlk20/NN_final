Over the years I had met a friend who we will call Fernando. On many occasions he told me many a times before, If you ever want to smoke with me you can just hit me up'. I always replied, Yeah alright. I dont really do it much but yeah Ill think about it. In reality, I didnt even smoke pot. I told him I did so I would seem cool. It didnt bother me that he smoked weed. I didnt care. I just told myself I wouldnt do it.
