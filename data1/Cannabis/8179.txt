i concentrated on not fighting the drug and riding it instead, and this helped a lot.  i managed to calm myself down enough to be receptive.  i began to get significant visuals as soon as i lay down, akin to the strength of my first time taking mushrooms (see report labeled 'Resurrection') but without the mental intensity.  i remember the open-eye and closed-eye visuals started to be essentially the same thing, so i couldn't always tell if my eyes were open or not.  Mostly a lot of geometric patterns and things being made of liquid and flowing.  Nothing event-oriented at this point.
