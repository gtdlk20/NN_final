I was sleeping over with two friends at their house (brothers). Now his parents are home and we weren't allowed to leave, and we were determined to get high that night, so we decided on equally splitting the dime and then eating it. I did not think that this would work at all. I just swallowed my portion in one bite and it was over. I waited while we were all watching T.V. on the couch. It was about a half hour later and I couldn't really feel anything, so me and my friend went out on the trampoline to try and feel the effects. At that time I didn't feel high at all just weird. After we were jumping we came inside and sat back down and watched T.V. after about an hour or so, I remembered that usually when it hits me it is because I do something to notice like change what I'm doing or something. So I get up and if fucking hits me like a ton of bricks.
