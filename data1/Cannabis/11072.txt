I don't really know how much time passed before I started noticing some incredible things. I remember looking at the bush and then looking over at my car. It was as if my vision lagged or something. It was like watching a slideshow. It was simply amazing. I got up to walk and couldn't really tell if my feet were touching the ground or not because my legs felt light. Like a feather.
