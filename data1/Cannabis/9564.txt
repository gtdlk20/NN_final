70 minutes: Nothing is better. I am in the most pain I've ever been in, and I've been through some painful stuff (voluntarily branding myself,amazing horrible drunk moments, being stabbed, etc.). The weirdest thing about this: I can control myself perfectly normal. I can talk, walk and interact with people. My friends convince me to leave. Getting down the stairs and to where I need to go takes concentration, but it is relatively easy. I have pretty good motor skills and I even am able to give the gym attendant a smile when she takes my towel.
