The music at some point had then turned into voices and noises. I could hear my whole family outside my door, all knowing I was high as a kite, and then I could hear my door knob rattling and shaking, and knew they were all trying to get in my room, I realized I was shaking uncontrollably, and instantly thought that the best way to avoid getting caught was to play that I was asleep. I became very still, and just waited for the door to open, and my family to burst into my room, but it never came.
