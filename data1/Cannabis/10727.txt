I told the guy behind the counter I wanted something to give me a head high buzz. Baddaboom I have an ounce of Purplekush. Sounded pretty and organic. I had a one-hit pipe and loaded it up. I took what I was told later, was an old school hit, immediately loaded again, sucked in and held it. I was good for about one minute. My hands went kinda numb and my body just s l o w l y went away from me. I told my boyfriend I was going to pass out and he laughed ...until I hit the floor. I was not unconscious, but damn close. Then the panic attack hit, and I had him help me up and walk me around like a first timer at a Dead concert. Once I got my heart rate down, I was done for. Couch locked, I am told they call it nowadays.
