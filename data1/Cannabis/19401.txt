We talked for a while and watched some TV.  The only other thing I can remember until that night is just staring at my friends face and watching it glow then turn into another friends face.  The second Justin turned on Any Colour You Like by Pink Floyd and told me to close my eyes and watch the colors.  That was a great show; it felt as if my body was being cut in half but in a pleasant way.  The feeling went up into my tooth and made my tooth feel fuzzy.  I then started to feel like liquid and the music made me feel as though my liquid self was slowly going upwards for some reason in a quelling motion.
