I tell myself, you can't overdose on weed.  You won't stop breathing.  Just don't fight it.  The shaking is really freaking me out and I say this out loud.  Eventually I figure out how to relax the large muscle groups (thank you, regular yoga practice!) and the shaking slows down and then becomes less noticeable.  I try to sleep but am in this half-tripping/ dizzy, paralyzed state and I have no idea if I actually slept or not.
