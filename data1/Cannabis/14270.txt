We got up to walk to a friend's about 30min. later and I saw patterns around my vision. You know where you can see farther right or left when looking straight ahead. Well, in the black area around my vision I could see patterns. I know I'm not crazy because I am sitting here typing this today more sober than I have ever been and I can't even see the blackness around my eyes. I think it's just me, but many times when I smoke I get the weird tunnel-like vision that I experienced that day.
