After a few minutes my head started spinning and I was scared. I felt almost like I had taken some good knocks to the head and was about to faint. Soon my hips started spinning and I stood in front of a full length mirror and laughed as I realized that I looked like I was trying to hula dance without a grass skirt (pardon the pun).
