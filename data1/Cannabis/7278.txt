We went back to the cabin reluctantly and went to sleep, waking the next day without the slightest hangover.  We smoked and then went into C's house for breakfast.  His mom had made it for us home made and it tasted fantastic.  We rode four wheelers and dirt bikes around more and watched tv for a few hours.
