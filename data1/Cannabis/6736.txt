Before I begin this, I want to tell you that I'm affected very strongly by weed, I half-hallucinate almost every time I smoke weed, and I've been having auditory hallucinations more and more frequently, which I love. So, my friend and I went to a beach party, which rapidly descended into a huge sausage fest. As we were leaving, someone else, who was also leaving, asked if anyone had any drugs or alcohol, well we had weed!
