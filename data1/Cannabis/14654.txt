I just sat there eyes half closed and taking in the sounds of the bush. At 10 o'clock I decided to leave, but when I stood up I collapsed back down, so I tried again and jumped onto the foot path, which was a 3m drop underneath the overhang. On my way home I heard all of these cries for help and I kept getting the feeling that something was stalking me. I started running as if I was running for my life, which spooked me a lot and I raced up the hill where I could reach the entrance. I made it out and went home to find that mum was already at home, so I bypassed home and went to the soccer field where I had a few more puffs and then closed my eyes so I could concentrate on the patterns that I was seeing. From that I remember reflecting on what I had heard and saw, so I slipped out of the sleep after a while because I felt that someone was gonna steal my headphones and discman and I realized that I never had gone to the soccerfield - I had fallen asleep in the bush and I was only dreaming it. The dream was the most lifelike and realistic I have had.
