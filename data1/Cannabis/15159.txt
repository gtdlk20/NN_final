About ten minutes later I was floating and the beat of the music had become one with my heartbeat, every time the bass bumped, my body twitched.  It was interesting almost to the point of disturbing me.  After that I started to fall into states of unconciousness where I would relive conversations I'd had recently.  When I emerged from that state the texture of my bed and ceiling became too much to ignore, so I fell into the ripples of the bed.  I know this sounds like an LSD trip, but this was purely pot (Cornbread reassured me his wasn't laced).
