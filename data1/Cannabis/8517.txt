She got a great hit as did I for the rest of the bowl.  By this time I was feeling great.  My head got light and right in around my eyes and nose got tight, and I kept scrunching my nose to release the tension.  Of course it didn't work, but it wasn't a bad feeling or anything so it didn't really bother me.  We were listening to some Phish and picked out Guyute especially.  All we could do was smile and dance as she drove 25 in a 45.  We tried to go the speed limit but it felt as though we were going 80 mph!!  I started to tell her to slow down and she looked at her speedometor and said 'Oh my God we're only going 25!'  I was like 'No we're not...we're going soo fast.'  But we weren't.  It felt like it though.  Everything was moving so fast and we were just stuck in the middle of it.
