There are times when I desperately want to be home so I can crawl into bed and sleep off this madness. I feel like I'm lost in a timeless cryptic hell. The nonsense language won't stop, I can't see anything BUT the visions and I just want it to end. Other times, I feel content to wander forever. I feel divinely connected to the insanity. I'm reminded of a line I heard in Waking Life, something about time, and how the secret to transcendence is learning how to live in the moment.
