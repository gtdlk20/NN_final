I managed to move myself but I also moved to the music so that every point of myself that I was aware of became a line (Kinda hard to explain but I basicly stretched every part of me) I then panicked slightly but realised I could undo it. For the next 10 seconds or so I played with this new trick (Stretching arms - legs - penis etc) The bizare thing is that I could actually feel these things changing. I then realised that if I can do this with my perceived physical body then I can do it with my mental self. The first thing that occurred to me is how much of a huge cock I could have if I played with this kind of auto hypnosis (is it?). I then told my head to make some kind of backup of my old self which I could go back to. I have no idea if this worked or not. I then tried to mess with my personality and make myself nicer. I actually felt the change and a kind of warm feeling in my chest, I also suddenly thought of all the loop holes in this change and how I could get walked all over etc. I then spent a while thinking and then realised the best thing to do was to repeat 'I wish everything and everyone was great and I was great to my self and to everyone else' I must have repeated this loads of times and I definatly felt my self change.
