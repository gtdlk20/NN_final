After gym class, I made the first mistake of the day. It was 2:00, and I could feel the body high, but my head was relatively clear. My friend asked if I wanted to go smoke a couple bowls before school ended. Now, you must understand that I smoke fairly regularly, and I've gotten pretty fucking stoned, but I had never been too high, you know? Like completely fucking bonkers. I had a feeling there was a line that once crossed brought you into the realm of the hopelessly ripped, but I was not sure where it was or what it would take to get there. After that fateful day, my definition of baked would change forever.
