On the large scale, smoking every night (or every day, or every morning) will, in my opinion, greatly reduce the quality of each experience; being high becomes too familiar to be a striking experience after five days straight of smoking. Smoking every other day, or better yet, once a week, is a lot easier on my body and healthier for the mind. After all, the point of a mind-altering drug is to create contrast with 'everyday life', so I need to experience enough everyday life to give definition to being high.
