I left J.s house late that night  the walk was very nice  that floating feeling persisted, I was in high spirits. I would say, an artificial euphoria as opposed to my unpredictable natural euphorias, except there must have been some element of the natural in it, seeing as how Id had what I would call a good day. I got home and puttered around a bit before going to bed and listening to music on my brand-spankinnew headphones. Im not sure if the music really sounded any better than normal, and if it did, it may just be because Id been listening with broken headphones on my computer the day before and crappy speakers on J.s computer the day just completed  but I remember enjoying what I heard a lot. One of the MP3s that my randomized playlist selected was the fourth movement from Beethovens Ode to Joy symphony, and I remember feeling more appreciative of the piece than Id ever been before  at that moment, I would have agreed that it was the greatest masterpiece ever written (normally, Im not so sure). Every note sounded clean and perfect, all the counterpoint seemed to seep into my ears with autonomous perfection  but Im not sure if this is the ideal way to listen to music, as I felt a sense of unity within the structure was lost  or maybe Im just spouting pedantic bullshit here, since its been a while since the experience, and I cant really remember if a sense of unity was in fact lost. Anyway, I listened to a few more tunes, then went to sleep.
