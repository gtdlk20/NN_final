I am one of those people who definitely has 'his head on straight.' I get good grades in school, I have many friends, and I really do enjoy my life. I am not planning on trying any other kinds of drugs in the future, but who knows. Entering my junior year in high school, I had only smoked two cigarettes and drank alcohol but never been intoxicated. I had smoked marijuana several times in the past and never particularly enjoyed it. I had been high but never quite understood what was so great about it. In fact, I still don't. However, I am trying to fully understand the life of an authentic 'stoner,' so I have been smoking until I really achieve a great high.
