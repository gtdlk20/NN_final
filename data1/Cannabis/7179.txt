That evening, my fever had reached a plateau. The feeling was not unpleasant. In fact, should there be a drug that replicated that sensation, I would be sorely tempted. My flesh glowed with warmth, but the flames under my skin weren't uncomfortably hot. I had a feeling of lightness, and sometimes when sitting or lying down, it was like I was floating. I felt a touch detached, and there was an oddly pleasing sluggishness to my thoughts, like running through knee-deep water on a hot summer day. I smiled a lot, deriving a great lot of satisfaction of the fact that this vicious invader inside me would be exterminated by my immune system, my beloved SS without mercy or regrets - and even now, in its heyday of parasitic rampage, the virus was only making me feel good!
