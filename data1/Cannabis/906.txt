I finally reached my destination and went in the store to purchase a big good full sandwich. I made the order, but because in the middle of my utterance another man spoke, I got confused and the lady asked me again for what I wanted. Thankfully I got it correctly, and quickly left for a while, until the food was ready, because I thought they would know that I am high and call the cops. I travelled on a narrow dark street, but because there were some people talking at a distance, I returned back to the main way. This was probably fear due to the effects. I was then following a recently reconstructed part of the sidewalk and finding delight in the row of bright white lights there, at which I was staring. One light in particular was mounted lower than the others, approx near my height, and I felt as if it was greeting me. Then I returned back to get the food, paid and quickly went home. As I was running quickly, I noticed that I was a bit lightheaded and was bouncing, and I feared that onlookers would find out.
