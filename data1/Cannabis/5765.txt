As the time went by, my trip went down a bit, and I just became more mellow, and passive, relaxed beyond measure, and just felt like starin into nothin, lettin my mind float into whatever universe it may have been headed at. Then, my friends decided to pipe up the weed I had brought with me in my stashbox, and we headed downstairs to the same spot again. I inhaled, and the smoke was hot, and unfortunately, we did not have a filter, so when I inhaled some ash. I was overwhelmed by a fit of coughin, and a horrendous burnin feelin in my throat and lungs. The pain in my lungs was very difficult to bare, I simply have not felt so much discomfort in my lungs before, and I just didn't want to take it.
