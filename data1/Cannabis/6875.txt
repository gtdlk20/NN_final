Although it was a scary experience at some times, it was also a fun and amazing one.  Something that in the long run, am glad that happened, but wouldnt want to go through it again.  I learned that thinking too much while smoking, especially bongs, will cause you to feel this way.  This was not just a high, it was more of a journey.  Everything was molding into each other, kind of like a strange movie, or reality tv show or something.
