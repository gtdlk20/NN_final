I don't think that Rob was experiencing the same visuals as I was, because when I asked him if he dug the guitar part of the song, which he was air guitaring to, he just said something to the effect of, Yeah, this shit is Insane Gargamel!, or something like that, but no mention of any tracers or light streaks.   Robs imagination and perception work a lot differently than mine (as everyone is a little different), but he was definitely entranced by the song as much as I was, so I just dropped trying to explain the phenomenon that I was picking up on and kicked back to enjoy it on my own.  Eventually, the little light show just sort of faded, as I had begun to shift from appreciating one aspect of the song to another, and another, and another.
