Anyways, I had tripped once before on weed, or at least thats what my journal entry says, but for the life of me I just cant remember it.

Despite my doubts as to the exact details of my life leading up to this experience, I did happen to take down a detailed account of the event itself, written only a day or so after it happened, so thats what Ill share:
