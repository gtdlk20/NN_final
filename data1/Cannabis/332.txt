This is by far the most psychedelic experience I've had with cannabis. I highly doubt that it was laced with anything, as you cannot lace cannabis with any drug (that I am aware of) of that effect. I have never used PCP, but I imagine PCP laced cannabis would be much more disorienting and delirious. Now, I haven't completely ruled out the idea that J and S saw the visions I did because I told them to look for them, and that it was a placebo effect, and maybe that's half of it (or more).
