This was the fourth time for me to smoke cannabis (marijuana) and the first time for me to feel any effect. The third time I tried I had a faint notion of increased sensitivity, that disappeared completely after about 30 mins. But this time the effect was much stronger. My guess is that I smoked differently, exhaling completely before inhaling the smoke, and keeping it longer in the lungs. Since I don't smoke cigarettes I am not used to smoking at all.
