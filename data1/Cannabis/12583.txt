I got up and looked down the hallway. It looked like it was really narrow and long. I started walking and his sister came out of her bedroom. She looked at me, with a weird expression on her face. I couldnt work out who she was. She was looking at me like something was terribly wrong. I kept walking on back into the lounge room. I know I had to go out the door, but my mind like shutdown, and I dont know why but I went and sat down. But it felt like I had walked out, my second out of body experience. I ended up getting up and following my friend outside.
