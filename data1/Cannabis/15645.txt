I recently tried smoking buddah.  What an experience it was.  The dosage was about 3 large bowls (by myself mind you).  I heard a lot about people smoking it and feeling great so I decided it was for me.  I lit up in the second floor of my garage where I have a small party room set up. I always heard that it worked fast, but for some reason I smoked all of it.  There was no reaction.  I was so disapointed because there was a school dance that night and I hoped to be stoned for it. So I thought what the hell I'll go have a couple of shots of vodka before I go that'll do the trick.  After about 30 minutes my mother called me in the house to eat.  I remember my mouth being extremely dry. While I was eating i went throught 5 glasses of soda.
