I took my first hit and held it way too far past my bounds, causing me to swallow part of the hit.  I took another hit after burping profusely.  This one I let myself cough out.  I passed the next round and hit the next bowl once.  At this point I became very irritated, not in an angry way, just I did not like anything about my present situation.  I started to complain about how smoky it was: I could barely catch my breath.  They courteously rolled down the windows because by this time, they were pretty much done.
