The next two times I took nutmeg were horrible. I had taken the same amount (2 tsp) but with a new bottle this time, rather then the one I had previously used that had been sitting in my pantry for over four years. I megged both times the night before and woke up totally fucked out of my mind. It wasnt a good high though. I puked multiple times and was high as shit for at least eight hours both times. I had extreme cotton mouth and a racing heart that was beating out of my chest. The last time I megged, nearly two years ago now, I even contemplated telling my mom what I had had done and telling her to call an ambulance. Afterwards I was very happy I didnt. For the next week my heart would beat out of my chest every time I would do anything remotely athletic.
