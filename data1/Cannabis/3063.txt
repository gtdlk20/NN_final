We lit up and soon, as was well anticipated, time slowed down to a crawl and we were thrown into hysterical laughter.  Once the laughter died down, we began to try interesting things.  E began to rapidly blink and let his head sway around on his shoulders.  Becoming a bit nervous, I poked him with a nearby stick to snap him out of it.  He quickly explained that he felt like his head was a tetherball, floating about his body.  Immediately, I said 'cool' and began to do the same thing myself.  I completely understood the feeling.  On a previous trip, E began breaking sticks, claiming that he was super strong.  We all thought he was nuts, but this time I actually understood what he was talking about back then.  E held out a fairly thick stick and I karate chopped it.  I must have hit it so perfectly that my hand seemed to pass right through it.  We began to find bigger and bigger sticks and would be able to chop them in half with the greatest of ease.  Realizing our incredible power, we decided not to try anything thicker for fear that we would seriously hurt ourselves.  The funny thing is, when we all had come down from our trip, our hands didn't hurt.  Weird, no?
