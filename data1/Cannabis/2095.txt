I am fifteen years old and am enrolled in lots of overachiever high school classes and so on and so on.  Nevertheless, I am decidedly lazy and inconsistent, maybe pulling an A plus in one unit and perhaps failing the next.  Last year I went through a minor depression during which I was slightly paranoid about others motives.  I have been on a low dose of floexetine (Prozac) for about a half year, and have since have returned back to normal.  I have no other known afflictions and am on no other medications.
