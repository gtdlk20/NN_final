When we got back (about 45 min in), we all got out and I wondered if I really was moving as slowly as I thought.  I assumed no since no one said anything and started to walk towards the doors.  Before we made it to the steps up to the building, some friends of ours who were smoking cigs on the smoking island called us over to talk for a few.  Me and A went over there to talk to them.  One of my friends was talking to me, telling me something, but I couldn't focus at all on what he said.  I just replied with 'yeah' and 'cool.'  As I was standing there, I notice that when I moved my head it seemed that I was turning the background of everything with me, as If I was looking at a wall, and when I turned, the wall was still flat in front of me.  Eventually we got out of there and I noticed that A was acting completely normal.  I don't think he was anywhere near where I was, I could barely put a thought together, much less sing songs and talk fast like him.
