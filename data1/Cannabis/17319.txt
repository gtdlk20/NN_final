We barely talked between us, but from small fragments of conversation we understood that we were all in the same trip. Our personalities showed through the veil of dropped words: I was anxious and delighted (i.e. be careful! be careful! do you know what means if we die?), BD was joking but the jokes adhered to the coherence of the story (i.e. we are all screwed, but TS, you are almost dead! TS being the one manning the soldier), TS living a mélange of lightheadedness and despair (i.e. noooo!).
