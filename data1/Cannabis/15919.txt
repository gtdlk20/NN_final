I went to the hill where I met my friends and went with them down to the local pub with some money to buy myself an eighth of weed from one of the dealers inside. We were in there for about half an hour, they were smoking their own stash, I hadn't opened mine yet because I was going to save it all for later on in the evening. All my friends told me I should smoke it now and I finally gave in. I opened up the bag and got a bud out. I then pulled my rizla out of my pocket, pulled a sheet out and tore off a bit of the lid to make a roach. I made myself a nice roach and put it in the left of the rizla. I then pulled small bits of my weed off the bud I had pulled out. I put them all into the rizla, making sure there was more weed to the end of the rizla so I could cone it properly. I then proceeded to roll a fat blunt :-)
