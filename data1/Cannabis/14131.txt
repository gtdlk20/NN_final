A friend of mine, Matt, was drifting away after the summer ended. We stopped talking and hanging out. Every now and then he would come over to my house, pick me up and we would drive around with his 'new' friends and get stoned. I didn't really feel connected with him anymore, he seemed older, more mature. Recently, we have been talking and hanging out a lot more, and I got to spend the night at his house with a friend of his. I didn't really know this new friend...and I felt intimidated. Anyway, we were walking around the area I live in, trying to get 'shrooms, but just settled for more weed. We went behind the movie theater and got stoned. They smoked 2 bowls between them, and I smoked 1 (I'm very sensitive). We then waited out front of the movie theater for Matt's friend's dad to pick us up. While we waited we had a long conversation about how fake the moon landing was. It was actually a very interesting conversation, full of exaggerated facts and fake sources, like most of the conversations me and Matt had over the summer, only Matt's friend was joining in.
