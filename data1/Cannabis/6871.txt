The director of my body decided to make me walk up and down every isle, if I saw someone, I felt quick panic, and tried to look interested in the products.  'Just look interested, they can never fool with your mind that way.  Especially that old lady right there, be careful, they make you feel guilty, paranoid, and fear.  Wait, its just an old lady you fool, just buy the damn coke like your supposed to.'  So I droop unwillingly toward the register, and I look straight at the lady at the register, hand her my wallet, and say 'Thank you for your help.'  The lady looked at me, speechless.  'I'm sorry, a little tired I am.'  I mumbled, and took my wallet back and paid for a coke and a candy bar.  The candy bar somehow got replaced with gatorade in my mind, strange.
