Im 18 still in high school and just started smoking a few months ago. My first two or three experiences with bud, I didn't feel a thing, as most commonly seen. I've never smoked anything before aside from messing around with cinnamon sticks with a friend of mine. I tried smoking on May 5th, 2006. I was a little tipsy at my friends house. He wasnt home so I was drinking with my best friend and the cousin of my friend whose house I was at. She (my friends cousin) told me she was picking up a sack later that night and I was totally down to try some marijuana with the persuasion of some alcohol. We eventually got some and broke out the 3 foot bong. I took 1 or 2 fat rips but didnt know how 2 inhale so got nothing out of it.
