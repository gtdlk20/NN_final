After this point.. things are fuzzy.  My head starts pounding.. I can't think straight at all. Its like my brain was shutting down and I was fighting it.  I could hear a buzzing, and it sounded (I know this sounds crazy, but its true..)like it was coming from Matt's cigarette.  Then the buzzing turned into a ringing.. And my head felt like it was going to burst.  I looked at Matt and told him I felt weird, and he asked if I was ok. I told him yes, and then I closed my eyes.  I dont think I've ever felt a high so intense.  I zoned out again, and remember falling down, and Matt saying.. 'Dude.. you didnt just do that.' He grabbed my arm and helped me up, and asked if I was ok, and I told him I needed to sit.  We walked back inside, and things are getting weirder for me.  My brain felt like it was in complete overload.. I went to get a glass of water and fell down again.. and laid on my kitchen floor for about 30 seconds untill Matt pulled me back up.  I got some water, I think, and we both went into my bedroom.  Matt turneed on my GameCube, and I sat infront of my computer.  The intensity slowly started to wear off.. It had only been about 5 minutes, but it felt like hours.  My brain was numb.
