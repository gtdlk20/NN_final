Then something peculiar happened. Something that I have not experienced even in my endeavors with the classic hallucinogens. I was watching the clouds and I could see colorful light patterns begin to define themselves against the white background. As these patterns became more evident they came together to form a bird. While the features of this bird were not clearly defined, its overall shape was. For the next 5 to 10 minutes I was flying next to this light bird that seemed to be playfully flapping in the wind. I rubbed my eyes, opened and closed them, pinched myself, did everything I could to convince myself my mind was playing tricks and still the bird persisted in my visual processes. For the first time in my life, I was having a 'hallucination' that appeared to be more than just mere sensory distortion. The bird eventually stopped in the middle of my visual view and spread its wings as if to reveal all of its glory, turned around and flew away into the distance.
