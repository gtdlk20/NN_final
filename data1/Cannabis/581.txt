I realized I was walking by two rectangular rugs with intricate designs weaved into them. I looked at one and it shifted from two dimensional to three-dimensional. It kept gaining a sense of depth and slowly became a portal to another world. I gave some nonsensical answer to my friend about what I was seeing and he didnÂ’t understand it. Then I walked right through the portal!
