Gradually, I felt better. Even tho I didn't remember this being how I felt when stoned, it was a familiar feeling, without a doubt. I felt warm inside and there was the sensation of waves... Like when you've spent a lot of time in the sea and your body still feels like it's moving. I was listening to 'white pony' and noticing SO MUCH that I'd never heard before and it was the best thing I'd ever heard. I was lying there, crying because I was just feeling everything so much.   It started to wear off, I don't know how long the heavy bit lasted. Then I was just thinking like I usually do when stoned, my thought processes being diverted somewhat, my mind making strange links between things.  Here comes the humourous part of the evening.  I started to ponder burping being impolite.  You ask people why it's not very nice. They say just cos it's impolite and they were taught not to do it.  So then my mind starts going, ahhh, but no, as it does when it decides to have an argument with itself. It could be a completely invalid point but my mind will throw it up anyway just to make things more interesting.  So my mind is going no, you think it's impolite cos you were brought up to think that, you don't still think the same about everything you were brought up to believe so why keep it up about socially acceptable things?
