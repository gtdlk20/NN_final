A nod and a big grin is the only response I receive. Now, man, I am not a strongly frequent user of Cannabis [It is only something I gladly indulge in on holidays, special occasions, weekends] and had no idea absolutely that this would be such an insane and other worldly thing for me. Sure, I *knew* this was a strong and crazy substance in front of me, but never did I imagine what was to come.
