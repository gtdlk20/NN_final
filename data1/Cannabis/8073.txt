Next day, same story. The low-level anesthesia persisted. Light touches like scratching my face, adjusting my clothes, toweling off my hands, and typing on a keyboard were barely felt at all  pain was somewhat muted, but not significantly (so this aint no practical painkiller). Yes, it was kind of cool, but two fucking days of that shit was starting to annoy me. I never realized the worth of tactile stimuli until it was taken from me.
