So, this where my story ends. And this is the advice I would have given myself beforehand: If some one warns you that 2 hits is enough for the night, trust him/her. Also, don't speak a lot because you won't make sense to those listening. And don't keep on smoking just because you aren't 'feeling it'. It takes a few minutes to get high. It's better that you take a little at a time and wait for the effects. Then, if desired, you may increase the amount accordingly. Otherwise, it will all kick in at once. Finally, I just want to mention that hydro is much much more powerful than regs, so you should always know what you are smoking and trust the people you are smoking with.
