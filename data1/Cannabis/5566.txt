All in all, oral dose seems like the route to go if you are into a really introspective and more serious high.  I do not think I will be eating weed again any time in the next few months but IÂ’m sure I will again.  This was a very intense experience and I can see how it would really freak someone out if they are prone to panic or bad anxiety.  I had a great time though and it is nice to be reminded how powerful of a plant marijuana really is.
