We talk about Krishnamurti and Joseph Cambell while she rolls a joint. I've missed her. I fumble through the two small containers in my pocket and fish out a 15mg capsule of 4-AcO-DMT. That's my choice for the night. We get out of the car and walk around the block to smoke the joint. I'm holding the capsule the whole time. Back in the club, I slip it back into my pocket and continue dancing.
