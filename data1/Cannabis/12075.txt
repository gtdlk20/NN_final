I decided to take my CD player to listen to some music while walking around the neighborhood, but I had forgotten to bring this adapter that lets me plug my headphones in. Anyways, I got up to walk down the street. At first I was planning on walking around the whole loop that is my entire neighborhood which is about 3 miles or so, but I'm not sure, it's big though. It was completely night by now, and I started getting paranoid so I decided to stay in my little area and just walk in a circle.
