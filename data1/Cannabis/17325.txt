I observed many times that under the influence of THC the most reality-altering phenomenon is literary coherence. Even the most fantastic story, if told coherently, builds up a fantastic world. My opinion is that the greatest asset in a group is a good storyteller. When we lack that, but still want an engaging trip which takes you in a different reality  we can play a computer game, recite a book (Clive Barker and Lovecraft work wonders) or explore the city. I am very much against watching movies because I feel like they draw people apart instead of together. Also, I never underestimate the value of smoking alone as it is practically the only occasion during which I can reflect/create/write undisturbed.
