After a couple left and right turns, I was totally disoriented. My heart was pounding like a jack hammer and I was beginning to wonder if I was having a heart attack. (Remember, I had a cardiac arrest almost exactly one year earlier  so I know what it feels like.) When I pulled over and asked my wife if she wouldnt mind driving (which I have never done before), it accelerated my fears and pulled her into the scenario. She asked if I was all right. I told her the pot was better than I expected and I was catching a major buzz. But inside, I was worried. Well, worried.. And scared shitless.
