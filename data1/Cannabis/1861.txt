To start with let me say that I have smoked (a lot of!) weed on/off for three years now as well as having used most of the other substances available at a college campus. This summer though I came home to India for an internship and as the quality of weed on the streets here is pretty bad, I started buying hash regularly for the past three months. Not only is the quality very good, it is also ridiculously cheap (<$25 for 10 grams).
