Since we'd taken the BDF three hours earlier, and I already had the sensation I have with acid rising that 'somethings coming', I took my friend upstairs, where the middle room at the top of the stairs is colourful in many ways, in lighting, in decoration, set up as a lounge to lay around in. A great place if you're expecting something visual. And it all went well, when it finally hit me I don't know if it was BDF or the alcohol, but I did have some short blackouts, some of wich I've remembered later on. But the loss of ego in a sense, that was wonderfull, I gave two girls the massage of their lifes, played drums with people, in one of the bedrooms there was a bit of a rave going on. And since it's Finland, a party ain't a real party without a sauna that's on all the time. It's almost impossible to precisely describe how the heat and steam felt, expect that they were wonderfull aswell. Everything was. The steam took colours when I wanted it to, I was very in control.
