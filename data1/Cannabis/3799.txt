4 PM (T+05:00)- Parents got home. No way could I handle talking to them. From the research that I had done, I thought that it should have worn off an hour ago, but it was still coming on strong, I was blown out of my mind. I was twitching and jumping on the vibes of the strongest high that I have ever had. I retreated to the woods behind my house and walked the well-used trail that is frequented by hippies, bikers, joggers and the like. I walked the trail for hours, waiting for the high to wear off.
