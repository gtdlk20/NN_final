The turning point happened from the day of my 20th birthday and in the days afterwards. S called me for my birthday, and our conversation was only slightly more than a minute long. This, that she gave me only a minute for all the endless days of emotional ruin, drove me into a rage the rest of the day, in which I was always seconds away from calling her and blowing up. I was disappointed that the perfect love I had felt for her during the weed trip was nowhere to be found, but it was something I could not control. Thankfully, my best friend, M, calmed me down and kept me from conducting such an enraged phone call, which I would undoubtedly regret. (By the way, M is the one who suggested I use music in combination with weed, so he knows all about it.)
