I try to close my eyes, thinking it might increase the effect, like when getting drunk on alcohol, but actually it has the opposite effect. The effect diminishes when I don't have any visual stimuli. Light is definitely a factor in how intense the feeling is, as it subsides when I go outside in the dark, and is strong when I am in front of the computer monitor.
