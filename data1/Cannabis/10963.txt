Mistake 1: L picked up seven doses of 2c-i. His dealer had told him, One is ok, two is a good time, and three puts you into space. Seeing as I had a cold, I decided I would do one dose and L would do two, leaving four doses for our friends who had pitched in. The mistake being we didnt actually know how much this dealer had defined as one dose.
