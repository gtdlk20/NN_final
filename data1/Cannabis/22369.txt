I had smoked weed about 7-8 times before this experience.  All of which I had been smoking 'shwag' (low quality weed) and had heard many times about how Kine/Skunk was much better and definitely worth the extra cash. I had also heard that weed, when ingested, gave a slightly different effect and that it strings out your high for as long as 6 hours.  I had ingested low-quality weed orally before, and didn't notice much difference from smoking it.. just a longer high.
