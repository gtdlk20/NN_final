First a few words about myself. I'm 17 years old, living in the Northeastern U.S., and have only been smoking weed since early this year. However, I've smoked on numerous different occasions, maybe once or twice a week, sometimes less often than that, and have enjoyed it alot. However, I had never had any kind of psychedelic experience on marijuana before.
