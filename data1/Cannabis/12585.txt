As I walked through the yard I just got a rush of pleasure, I felt so happy to be alive and tripping so well, all the colours were bright and vibrant. I suddenly yelled out at the top of my lungs, MAN IM TRIPPIN HARDCORE!! and I started laughing uncontrollably. My friend yelled at me, I felt as if I had killed someone, I felt really guilty, my mood changed right away. Walking down the street it seemed as though my head was detached and bouncing on my neck.
