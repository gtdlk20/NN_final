While in this state I kept quiet and kept on smoking while observing the conversation going on by the others. I was occasionally asked by them every so often if i was alright, I gave them a nod and replied that I was fine. I was layed down and the depressive state kept creeping up on me. By this time I was very intoxicated and eventually my vision was consumed with bright moving patterns. I began thinking about my life, friends, family and my future, but that was making me more depresssed as I didnt have a clue what I was going to do with myself after College. I began thinking how i was percived by  people that knew me. Then It hit like a ton of bricks, I understood how i was percived. I could see myself reconstructing was i was like around people like my friends for example, was I some sort of Geek or some annoying moron that other people look down on? could this be the reason why I dont always remain friends with people? because I cramp there style? Was this me? Millions of these thoughs rushed around my head while each one was reanacted in my mind. Everybody else at this time was chilled out with only a two way conversation going on. I asked everybody else if they was mashed (Mashed meaning very stoned/intoxicated) they and they agreed.
