I freaked out and layed down on the ground. I remained calm.. my heart was racing.. I knew the best thing to do was to remain calm. The sense of touch-lock went away and was replaced with a very fast twirling. It was not the kind of sickly drunk twirl.. I couldn't feel it in my stomach, but it felt like my senses were spinning. I got up, put on some relaxing music and layed down and relaxed again. It worked for a while. I started going through cycles in my mind and body. My sense of touch first, then visuals, then sense of time.
