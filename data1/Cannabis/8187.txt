i try to lace my shoes, fail, sit down and retrace my steps, and avoid freaking out.  'just relax' i tell myself as i fumble through an action i could do the last seventeen years or so with no trouble.  i mean, just because i can't tie my shoes shouldn't mean that i can't maintain order in public, play an instrument accompanying a whole congregation of people as well as a singer, and deal with the hierarchy of the catholic church, right?
