It all ten-folded from there.  I was experiencing feeling that I had never felt before when i was high.  Everything was blown way out of proportion.  I grabbed a handfull of chips and started to much on them and thought... my tounge feels awful funny... Hmm.   I chewing the chips i was eathing and started to move my tounge around inside my mouth.  It was the most odd feeling i had ever encountered. It was as if my tounge were partially numb, but its actions FELT inversed.  I would put my tounge on the roof of my mouth and think to myself - Big Al dude.. thats the TOP of your mouth you moron, but the physical side of me was telling me.. No Al... your on the bottom right now.
