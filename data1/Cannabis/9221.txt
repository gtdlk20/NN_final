I decided I would walk into the bathroom. As I was walking I could not specify which room was what. Luckily Matt held my hand and led me to the bathroom. I started throwing up violently. I flushed the toilet and was amazed at what I saw. As disgusting as it sounds, the toilet water looked like a million crystals. I smiled to myself thinking that beautiful water fairies must have a secret heaven and palace in that disgusting toilet bowl. After a few more times of throwing up... the twitching really set it.
