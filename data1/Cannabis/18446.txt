It was damn BMF (Bad Mother Fucker) and a damned Ox. Naturally, both of their nicknames were changed to protect identities and/or possible misconceptions about their nature. One of the first things to come forth from BMFs mouth: 'Hey...you guys want some tabs?' Jesus Fuck! Why must they have dealt us these cards? Of course we wanted tabs damn it. We'd do tabs any time of the day. So, we had a short conversation, gathered up money, told the orders, and then waited. At this point that the two friends that just joined us were on Crystal Meth. So...we weren't too sure what to expect. I was debating whether or not to do the tabs that night, but after I found out that others would be and it wouldn't be me alone, I went for it. Just then, two other friends showed up, these two of the opposite sex. Sicily and Fuck-Up walked in for reasons I'm still not sure of.
