We then smoked the rest of my weed in a blunt, and they smoked 2 more bowls between them. A half hour later, I asked if we could smoke more, so Matt packed 3 bowls. About an hour after smoking out of the pipe, I asked to smoke a little more, so we smoked 2 more bowls. Now I felt even more comfortable. These were my friends. We talked about how weird batman was, and how great weed is. I didn't quite learn anything new while hanging out with them. I never smoked weed to have a 'life affirming experience.' Just after me and Matt drifted away, I kind of became a hermit, and lonely, unable to care about anyone, but that night changed my attitude completely. It was a great experience, and I never felt more comfortable around two people in my entire life.
