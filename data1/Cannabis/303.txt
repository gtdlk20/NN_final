We all intended on smoking, so we parked the car in the new spot, and headed up a trail for about 100 ft. We came to a 3-way (4-way if u count the way we came from) crossroads, and couldn't decide which way to go, plus it was getting dark. K and I had brought our guitars, but I left mine in the car, as it had no strap to carry it around on, but K brought his with him. Anyway, here we were at the crossroads, me, S, K and J (S's cousin)-and after a short blues riff from K to make a song out of which road to take, we chose one.
