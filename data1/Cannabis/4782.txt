The day I spent meeting friends and doing the prementioned, until I took a bus home, fell asleep around eight only to wake up at midnight to still a very jolly mood, restarted drinking with my roommate for a few more hours and finally crashed to real sleep after taking double of my normal 2 mg rivotril and a few valium.
