About 20 minutes later I felt what I believe was the onset of the brownie (it was somewhat unclear since I was already high).  I have a quick stomach, and it was pretty much empty so I knew it would come quickly. It was a little longer for the other two I was with.  Once it started coming on it built pretty quickly and strongly.  We hung out in my kitchen and just talked and joked around for a while, conversation flowed pretty easily.  At about 4:30 we headed to the basement to watch TV, which was hilarious.  We watched for a little over an hour and laughed a lot.  Had a few of those precious rounds of laughing where we would laugh at something and then maintain it by looking at each other and laughing about how we were laughing.  Gotta love those.
