Since then, I've smoked on countless occasions and only felt mild anxiety once or twice, and I've certainly never experienced paranois like I did before. In a way, I'd say the experience was beneficial to me in that it gave me an insight on what it's like to be truly terrified, even though this might seem like an experience you would want to avoid, I feel that I learnt from it. After this experience I was always more aware of how drugs could dramatically alter my perceptions, and I became more careful with the way I use drugs. Now I only smoke or take pills when I'm feeling totally relaxed and comfortable in an environment, and even when in the few instances when I haven't adhered to this rule, I've never had a repeat experience.
