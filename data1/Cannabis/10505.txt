An hour passed and I was still in really bad shape.  I couldn't act stright even if I wanted to, so I couldn't go anywhere around other people.  Thus, they decided to just take me for a drive in one of my friends car.  I got the energy to get upstairs, then I preceded to vomit in the sink for a while.  Then, I remember going outside and watching my friends play hackey sack for a while.  Then, we got into the car and started to drive.
