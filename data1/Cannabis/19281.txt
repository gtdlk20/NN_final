Like the many times before, nothing appeared different than normal life. I just went upstairs and got a drink of water. After I got my drink I walked over to my friend C and began to talk with her. I forget what we talked about, but one time during the conversation I went to have a drink of water from my glass, when I realized that I didnt have a glass in my hand.
