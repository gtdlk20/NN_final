I was beginning to experience a kind of 'perception strobe' effect where, if this makes any sense, the entirety of my conscious perception (all my human senses, perception of time, thoughts, you name it) was trailing, like the visual trails you get from taking LSD but applied to every point of consciousness.  Luckily my roommate was home- let's call him Mr. Level Head, and his calm presence was quite reassuring.  I felt more reassured for my safety (goodbye paranoia!) and more willing to accept my fate- which was pretty interesting, albeit uncomfortable.  By 9:30am I was resigned to laying on a couch, walking was too difficult.  As I lay there, I was experiencing a feeling, a sensation, that was kind of 'superphysical'- I was experiencing the feeling of the boudaries of my body as an aura, expanding outward like ripples.  I never actually dissociated.  Even looking at myself I could see where I was and how I was laying, but what I felt was my 'being' radiating outward in ripples, coupled with the crazy perceptual strobe i mentioned.  As I got higher, the farther out I radiated and the stronger the strobe.  It was interesting, but not so pleasant ...waaay beyond stoned.  I lay there for pretty much the rest of the day, totally incapacitated.  Around noon I would say I was the highest I've ever been.
