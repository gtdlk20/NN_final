We knew the night was just begining, so we rode C's four wheelers in the dark up to a spot on a hill overlooking his house, and a wonderful view of the lights of nearby cities and towns.  The ride up was unbelieveable.  Although it was dark, I could feel our speed with extreme physicality.  The cool rushing wind in the blackness was indescribable.  I imagined that I was in the Green Berets, rushing covertly to a bivouac site, and suddenly I was.  I imagined that a dog sled team was pulling me silently through the chill Alaskan night, and suddenly I was.  The ride, which could not have lasted for more than 2 minutes, seemed to strech on for a very long time.  Once at our camping site, we set up a campfire and roasted marshmallows and smoked more pot.
