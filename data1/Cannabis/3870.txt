Im not particularly spiritual, more of a scientific skeptic, so Im not going to assign any deeper meanings or revelations to this trip. It was awesome, but it was just a trip. Also, I have NO idea how my marvelous brain works or what the true nature of reality is. There will have to be further experimentation :)
