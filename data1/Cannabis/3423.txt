By this time I was starting to calm down a bit but was still only able to form simple sentences with slurred speech. I sounded like someone who was just learning English. My friend had the munchies so we decided to go into our local fast food restaurant and get something to eat. When we were in line waiting to order I spotted a girl I knew from one of my classes. I couldnt tell if it was her or not so I stopped and stared at her. She looked at me strangely but I didnt realize what I was doing could be considered odd. My friend decided not to order and told me we were leaving. I continued to stare at the girl as I slowly walked out of the restaurant. Walk faster! my friend told me. I didnt realize how slow I was going. I must have looked ridiculous.
