Ill begin my account of the cannabis induced  experience I had last night after a brief introduction and a slab of background information about myself. Im an 18 year old college student majoring in liberal arts. Im a very analytical person by nature and I am very interested in philosophy (even when I'm not stoned). Ive been smoking marijuana daily for about six months  (2-3 dime bags daily). Typically after smoking cannabis I become intensely philosophical. Ive come to many realizations, both good and bad about reality and existence itself.
