My smoking buddy and I went to A house I was sitting, flipped on the TV, and immediatly started taking hits off of a fairly large blunt. I can remember waiting abnormaly long for the buzz to kick in, but when it hit I immediatly knew it was'nt going to be a good one. My heart rate escalated and my knees began to feel week. It came on so fast and I knew it was only begining. My thought began to race and I decide get a drink of water and try to eat something, but on the way to the kitchen (which was about 20') I felt another wave of panic and disorientation and collapsed. I was definitly caught off gaurd.
