My friend and I smoked 2 pretty fat joints and were sitting in a parking lot when I had a revalation. What if air distorted images simular to water or heat. So I sat and contemplated for about 20 minutes and came to the conclusion that air causes our eyes to distort but since we have been living so long with air in the atmosphere that we have adapted in the way that fish adapt to seeing through the distorion of water. It would be the exact same if we lived in darkness for the duration of our existence. Our eyes and ears would adapt to the darkness and enable us to move around. This thought process tripped me out in a great way and I enjoyed the rest of my night trying to grab the air and hold it.
