Lately I have grown to smoke weed maybe once a week or so, and wouldnt prefer it any other way. When I smoke too often, the effects are less. I enjoy kind of tripping out, and definitely listening to music like in bed, right after I blaze.  Songs Ive know for years just trip me out. It will sound kind of different, but I'll notice different instruments or stuff. Ill be tranced in it and just get my groove on. With my eyes closed I can see shit, like all sorts of random scenery, some patterns colors, old memories. I can come up with great ideas.
