Anyway that morning I loaded up my homemade bong and toked away. What happened about 10 minutes later changed my purpose for getting high. Before this I just cared about getting as destroyed as possible. Before this I just cared about getting as destroyed as possible. Well anyway after I finished smoking I layed down in my bed and put on my headphones and turned on a song that sounded trippy called strobe by deadmau5. My shoulders, which had been aching from carrying my heavy backpack began to feel a overwhelmingly euphoric rush. I just thought to myself, this is medicine for soul and body. I sat up in my bed looking out my window with the sunlight shining in on me and I felt just pure astonishment of the universe. I closed my eyes and I just kept thinking that this is God's herb and that it was placed here for a reason.Â
