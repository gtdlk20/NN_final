After a minute I had audial hallucinatons. Sounding like waves of a harp like noise plus some weird bass/beat all in sync.  I was walking a few miles with fattest grin of my life, (this wasn't my first time or anywhere near) I tried to grab my face and physically change the smile, my face felt like rubber, I couldn't  remove the smile I was too happy.
