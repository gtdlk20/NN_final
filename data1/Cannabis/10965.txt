Mistake 2: L had done 2c-i three times before. One time, he had snorted it, and the other, he had eaten it. Another time he had tried to snort it, but blew his nose and apparently didnt have anything happen. He told me that the snorting was, and I quote, kinda shitty, but worth it. The mistake being that he had never measured out his own snorted dose, or described just how shitty kinda shitty really was. You see, L is a tank. I am not.
