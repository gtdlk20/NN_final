When we got there, it was on. In under thirty minutes we were already offered cannabiscakes, the mood there was lively and we ended up immediately sitting in the kitchen, the heart of a houses social life. Since atleast half of the people there were either my friends or their friends, neither of us felt any unnesessary fears or such, we blended in just fine.
