CBD is to be respected even if it is legal and is supposedly not psychoactive I smoked too much in too little time and I felt that I nearly paid the consequences from this experience. ItÂ’s true you can have too much of a good thing I'm not so sure that it was only CBD on these flowers as the high felt psychoactive very much so but without lab testing I would never know.
