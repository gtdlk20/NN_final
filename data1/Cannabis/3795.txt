12:40 PM (T+:01:40)- My dog was barking. She was fucking freaking out on some people that had come ashore near us. I was way too fucked up to handle shit like this, but somehow I managed to rise and calm down the dog and apologise to the frightened couple. It was time to get out of there before something really bad happened. My cousin was already starting to notice that something was deeply wrong inside me, and I'm a very introverted smoker as it is.
