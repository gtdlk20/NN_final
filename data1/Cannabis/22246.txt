Now I've read all of the Lord of the Rings books and was heavily psyched to see this movie.  After a few confusing happenings buying tickets and seeing friends from school, we get into the movie.  Even if I had been in my right mind, this movie would have been sweet, but after smoking what I had, it was nothing short of a religious experience.  I highly recommend seeing it even without smoking first.
