40 minutes: This is the last interval that I am normal. Still, kinda, high, I can feel that I'm coming down a bit.I remember being on a machine by myself, finishing, and then being alone. My friends had left me, and gone to the other side of the gym, innocently enough. I don't know if this triggered my experience or if it was the combination of working out and not eating, but what happened next was one of the most terrifying moments of my life.
