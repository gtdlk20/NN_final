I was a freshman in high school who got high every so often - not a pothead. a friend called and said come over so i did. i got there and he pulled out a sorta pipe that we hit off for a few minutes, maybe 15.  he gave me 3-4 shotguns, then we went to the table, got out the bong and hit off it, very large hits. i think we were sitting there trying to do a puzzle, which was extremely difficult and confusing. i couldn't get any, but my other friend, not the one smoking but who had already had a lot, was doing it pretty good. i decided to leave and go home when i started to get bored and uncomfortable. i started walking home. i put my hat and jacket on but really didn't like what i was wearing. i thought i looked extremely ignorant and couldn't get comfortable. my pants were bugging me and i couldn't get my hands in a normal position. i would get them one place and then decide it wasn't normal. then i realized that i didn't know what was normal and i just flat out couldn't get comfortable. i didnt know how fast to walk. i was trying to act straight, but just couldn't feel like i was. i then couldn't figure out the purpose for me on earth, not all this time. i was thinking about my self-importance and the universe and people in general. i lost who i was. i mean, i knew who i was, where i was at, but i couldn't put my finger on who i really was inside. i felt like my thoughts were right in front of me and that they were out of my head. then i started getting worried about if the weed or something was laced with lsd or a hallucinogen, because i had been high before and this was not normal. i was so uncomfortable when i got home i couldn't figure out if anything i did was normal. i changed clothes over and over, laid down, sat up, tried to watch a movie, but everything was annoying. then my girlfriend called, which suddenly made everything better and nomal. i thought i was completely sober when she came over. i snuggled up with her in her bosom and felt like a million bucks. but that event still lingers in my mind, pondering what went on and why.
