My friend and I were smoking up in the park with my beautiful technicolor bowl Kate. My mental state at the time is important- I had just previously gotten out of a state of extreme frustration and tension and had begun to release the pressure in a strange, aggressive torrent of energy. It was a Friday and I was finally feeling more or less relaxed and in a state of total abandon.
