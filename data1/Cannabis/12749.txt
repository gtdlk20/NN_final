Feeling a little scared at these sensations I had never experienced before I decided to just stay still  and not risk any movement.  I'm not sure whetehr to describe this as an unpleasant or pleasant experience, all I can do is  describe it as something new.  This cannabis was a strain I had never tried before, and I'm not sure whether it was the fact that I had not smoked for 5 days or the fact that the weed was that potent, but it was definetly a new experience.
