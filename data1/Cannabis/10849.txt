We made our way to the garage where I saw J was preparing the gravity bongs for us, with a socket that he had saved in his room from some old toolbox or something. He set it up and then I took out my bud. I never charge my friends and I love smoking fellow bros up. He lit it and we took big hits off of it; I would say about 4 or 5 I had. We only used about .3 of weed, so it wasnÂ’t that bad.
