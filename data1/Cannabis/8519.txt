Our reactions were slow and our sense of direction was totally gone.  My friend would stop and the green lights for 2 seconds before realizing they were green and not red.  Everything was funny to us, we laughed at eachother, and what we were doing.  We talked like there was no tomorrow it was great.  We also drank soo much water on the short car ride.  Well, it was supposed to be short, but we got lost for 2 hours.  What is funny about that is that we were in a part of town that we both knew like the back of our own hand.  It didn't matter, we were stupid and didn't know where we were.  So we drove around in circles for 2 hours and still we were high.  We got closer to school, and we both mutually decided to smoke another bowl!!  He he he, it was even better.
