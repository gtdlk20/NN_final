My sister, this guy and I decided to make brownies (for the first time), so we had him come over with 0.5ounce bag of weed (pretty good weed too). After they were finished baking, everyone took a brownie. The brownies tasted exactly like weed, but with a dark chocolate flavour added and were hard to swallow... sooo chocolatey and weedy... mmm...anyways, I ended up eating one brownie, the guy had two and my sister ate three.
