11pm:  I feel high and happy.  I think I may have taken another sip here but I don't exactly recall.  I crawl in my tent and snuggle down into my sleeping bag.  My partner is outside and a few minutes later he crawls into the tent with me.  I'm in a spaceship.  I giggle, welcome to my spaceship! We laugh a bit and he lays down with me.  Then the spins start.  I am really in a spaceship hurtling through space, spinning out of the gravitational pull of the earth.  I focus on the round zipper tent door and the glow of the red lantern hanging from the ceiling.  I'm falling backwards, spinning, starting to get dizzy.  I try to breathe through it.  Now I'm shaking- full body convulsions starting with my legs and radiating throughout my body.  Do I need to go dance?  Does my body need to move?  No, I'm so tired and tripping pretty hard now.  This happens to me sometimes when I take mushrooms so I didn't immediately panic.  But it was actually pretty frightening.  I kept breathing, counting my in-breath/out-breath, telling my muscles to relax.  My partner noticed I was shaking and helped me focus on my breath and hugged me.
