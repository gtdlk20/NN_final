I was still coughing about every other breath, but I managed to slowly adjust to drinking water, and eventually had enough control over myself to leave and drive back home.  I took the mega-hit at around 4 PM.  I was still feeling high at 9 PM.  For some of you, that's a normal days work, but for a daily smoker like me, that's absolutely incredible.
