Every note, every beat, every part of the song was somehow in my head, contributing to this strange hallucination. I know that it was partially my imagination creating a lot of it, but at the same time I had no control over it, the song was presenting itself to me the way my mind interpreted it. The song has two parts which build up into the explosion of energy and both are fairly similar to each other. The second part of the song, it became so intense that my eyes started fluttering up and down, and I was seeing flashes of white light, so I was forced to open my eyes and gather myself for fear I would go into a convulsion.
