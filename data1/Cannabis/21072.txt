I have just smoked a bowl and as I am beginning to feel the warm onset of dope pleasure I am thinking about what Marijuana has done to me. I've only been smoking for a year and-a-half, but my life has definitely changed since that first waterfall. My taste in music has become broadened, I am a calmer person. I feel more generous and loving towards my friends. I think that in general it has made me a better person. I can see the beauty in everything, from a butterfly on a flower to the view of a night city from high up. However I do feel that Anti-Motivational Syndrome is a real thing, but I have tried to be a 'responsible' user and  always tried to complete my studies.
