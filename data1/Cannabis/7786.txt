The first time I tripped out on ganja was about 3 years ago when I smoked purple haze and thought a roundabout in a kids' playground was trying to eat me. This resulted in me crawling, commando-style, across the ground, in an attempt to escape said evil playing apparatus.   I didn't think anything like that would ever happen to me again. But it did. Not quite like that but with very bizarre trip-like elements that I wouldn't have expected from ganja.
