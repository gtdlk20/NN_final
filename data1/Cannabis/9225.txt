At this point Matt somehow gets me into his room. I can't even lift my head or I feel as if I'm going to puke all over again.  I opt to sleep on the floor.  He turned out all of the lights thinking it would help. The visions came back after he turned out the lights. They were not as harsh, it was more as if I was in a spiraling universe in space.  Thank god I somehow made it onto the bed and fell asleep. Escaping the internal hell I smoked myself into.
