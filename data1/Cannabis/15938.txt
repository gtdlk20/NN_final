The thing I remember about sitting there the most is how I couldn't feel the chair I was sitting on, I couldn't feel the table I was leaning on, and I couldn't feel the temperature of the room I was in. It was as if I was just in my own little bubble around me and I couldn't hear what anyone else in the chippie were saying. I was just sitting there, it was just me and nobody else in that chippie, and I felt great.
