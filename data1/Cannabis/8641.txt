Then when things started to calm down, i ended up saying to myself 'something else, something else.' The first something else would be louder than the second one.  Thus, throwing me into a trance.  The two different levels of sound i was now exploring became my whole reality.  Kaleidescope vision would happen when i would close my eyes, and i would continue to repeat this while wandering around the park closing my eyes.  For most of the night, everyone just laughed.  But because it was my first time of exploring myself, i was more entertained by things which i was doing, rather than what people had said.
