I took a hit of the first joint and held it in as long as I could, about 30 seconds. I exhaled and immediately took another long toke and held it in for the same ammount of time. By the time I passed the joint to my room mate, I could already tell it was going to be one of 'those times'. After coughing for about five minutes while my head buzzed like crazy, I settled into a strange dream-like state. It's the same feeling I get coming down from shrooms. It feels like I'm waking up from sleep every 5 seconds or so. Or like I'm not actually part of time. I can remember everything that happened, but nothing that happens regisers with me UNTIL I remember it. It's hard to explain. I don't know how long we were out there, but it felt like hours. The wind was blowing my face off, and I felt like if I turned my head I would see my flesh blowing away with the wind.
