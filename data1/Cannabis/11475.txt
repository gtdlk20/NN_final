Suddenly, my friend gasps loudly and begins to take offrunning.  She yells out 'My dad is here! My dad is here!' So in a frenzy I took off running after her.  I suddenly felt as if  I had been running in slow motion, with time and the images around me moving at a very slow pace.  I could still see the giant green blot of trees next to me along with the sickenly gray concrete.  Next thing I knew my friend and I were inside of the bathroom of a nearby restaurant.  At this point my entire body had gone numb, including my mouth and my hands.  I was a bit confused as to how I had gotten into the bathroom; wondering how much time had gone by between the panicked run and now.
