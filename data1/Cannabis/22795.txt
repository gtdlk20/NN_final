Once upon a merry little time, I was feeling rather sick.  I decided the best medicine would be some high quality grass.  So I called my friends over.  We rolled two decent sized joints and smoked them between the two of us.  Being a very inexperienced smoker at the time, I was very fucked up.  When someone tried to talk to me, their voice would echo in my head.  I kept having flashbacks of my childhood, hearing old phrases and seeing old faces.  After about ten minutes, my friends went home.  It was about 10:00 and the shit was just kicking in hard.  I decided to go to bed.  I put on a Floyd concert, turned out the lights and got into bed.  I closed my eyes and immediatelly I was transported to an alien world.  The lights from the t.v. created some of the most amazing closed eye visuals I had ever seen.  Then suddenly my bed lifted off the ground.  I had the desire to open my eyes because it was way too real.  But I kept them shut.  As my bed went soaring through the clouds, I realized that I was not at all sick anymore.  So I continued to enjoy spinning through a spiral vortex of color and thought.
