Oh god, it burned. I had never even smoked a cigarette before, let alone cannabis. It reminded me of the time I had been hit in the chest with a soccer ball, and had the wind knocked out of me. I was desperate for water, a coke, anything, and for a moment even the swimming pool water looked good, thankfully my girlfriend stopped me before I gulped down pool water.
