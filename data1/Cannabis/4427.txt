A few reminders: First, I thought high meant extremely happyI had no idea about the disorientation and dream-like state you would encounter. Second, we smoked I-dont-know-how-much in grams or whatever, but we evenly shared 2 full bushels or nugs. Third, we smoked it out of a tinny- a simple device easier (I thought) than rolling it up. Fourth, we began smoking it in a forest that me and N had known our whole lives; we could be blindfolded and know where were going. (This forest was only a few acres big though.) Fifth, we began smoking it around 5:00pm-ish. This is in Ohio around Novemberish, so light fades away at 6:00pm-ish (at least from a dim forest perspective) Sixth, we were all around 15-16years old, sophomores in high school. Seventh, me and C are straight-A honor students (ironic, I know).
