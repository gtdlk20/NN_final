+0:45 - I'm talking to myself a LOT right now. It's lonely here by myself and I'm feeling it in a big way. The first of the psychedelic-like effects - time dilation - is kicking in now. Every song I hear feels like it's been playing for some very long yet indistinct period of time. Inside my head, my thoughts are turning backward - I'm amazingly nostalgic, even for things that are only blurry memories now. It's not like I was a teenaged pothead or anything so this isn't some sensory trigger but an effect of the chemicals themselves.
