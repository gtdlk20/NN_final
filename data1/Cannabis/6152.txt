As 1 became 2 and 2 became 3, I started to notice my bathroom sink and the items which inhabited the area around said sink becoming very interesting. At times I would have to snap myself out of my glazed stare to fill up the bottle again or pack another hit. By the 4th cone I was coughing like a coal miner and felt the need to sit down and asses were I was. It was either brave or stupid to ignoring my physical needs and push onwards for 1 or 2 more cones. After going the extra yard and taking 2 more hits (A total of 6 waterfall cones for those of you not keeping score) I went out to where I spent most of my time, The computer/TV area and looked to see who was on msn.
