What horrible emotions I began to feel... I had never felt this depressed in my life. My life was not over, I had so much more to live for... people needed me... I needed to complete my life. And my poor body, lying there lifeless. I had spent so much of my time caring for it, cleansing it daily, and now it was gone in wasted neglect. I began to cry. I felt the crying sensation, but I don't believe my bodyless form actually produced tears. I needed to go back, continue on with my life. I reached out with a non-existant arm, and began to glide back towards my body. Closer and closer, until finally I touched my own face, and at that instant, my eyes opened. Me, inside my body, opened my eyes.
