I noticed as I walked that my limbs seemed to be working completely under their own control.  As I walked my legs felt as if they were controlling themselves, and there seemed to be a very powerful force pulling me around.  If I would lean heavily to one side, the force would pull me back, as if I literally could not fall over, the force would not allow it.  The night was wonderful.  As I typed on the keyboard, my hands seemed to float, and perfectly coherant sentences would turn into incessant ramblings, or just random letters being mashed.  Yet they all seemed to make sense.
