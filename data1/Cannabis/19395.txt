The time is now around 1 pm and we are sitting at home admiring his new water bong.  Again it is just my friend Justin and I.  We still didnt think to get anything to eat when suddenly the doorbell rang and in walked my pothead friend Scott.  We could always get weed from him and today was no exception, we decided to buy and eighth and ended up smoking it in his car with the water bong.  Justin got the first hit and I saw him draw no smoke into the chamber and my doubts were starting to arise.  The bong went to Scott and he took one of the most monster hits I ever saw and didnt choke.  I couldnt wait to try it, and after what seemed like a day it came back to me and I settled it into my lap and put my mouth to it.  I prayed to have a good high and hoped I got really stoned off of the bong.   I drew a big hit into the chamber and cleared it expecting to kill myself coughing but it was so nice and smooth! The hit I took was almost like a cigarette! I should mention that this bud was nothing more then powerful oregano, really nothing good.... we didnt care though, it was working it seemed.  That is to say, it was weed but a very inferior quality as I judged by the mass amounts of seeds and stems, and just the way it smoked.  I went on and took about 10 hits off the bong and we ended up smoking the rest of the eighth.
