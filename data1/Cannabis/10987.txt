t-00:07- I ask G to put on some classical music. Not knowing much about classical music, he puts on a deep, dramatic and ominous set. Unknowingly to me, the trip had already started, and the music frightened me to death. I shouted out something to the tune of, DIFFERENT FUCKING CLASSICAL MUSIC and told myself that as long as L is ok, I knew I was fine.
