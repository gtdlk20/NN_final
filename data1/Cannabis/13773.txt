On a warm friday night, I and a couple of buddies decided to go out. We knew there was a good party, organized by a friend of ours, who would give us free beer. So the 3 of us went there by bike, since none of us had a car. The place of the party was about 15 kilometers away, so we were pretty tired when we got there. At the party, we first went to meet a friend of ours, who treated us to a beer or 2. A little later, we went outside, and one of my friends, L, told me he had brought a joint loaded with hashish. We were both experienced with cannabis, but he had never had a decent high (my diagnosis was that he mentally, subconsciously refused to get high, or something to that extent). About 15 minutes after we smoked the joint, we both started laughing like madmen. We sat outside for a while, simply laughing.
