We started off the night by chillen and sittin around, smoking cigarettes, and watching tv. When the time came to smoke, we got out my friends bong, and I decided to go first. I was very excited about this trip, it had been a month or so since I had smoked, and I had been with my good friends. So I was eager to smoke. I started off taking a huge hit, I held the smoke in for some 30-40 seconds and then exhaled, to amazing find I was already starting to get buzzed. My body was numbing slowly, and everything around me just made me happy. Soon enough the first bowl was finished and I was definitely high.
