So I let it go, and there was so much smoke that it came up again without exhaling it. So I started to cough, and all my friends started to laugh their lungs out and I ran to the bathroom and just coughed in the toilet. Then it was over I went to lay down on my friends bed, I felt like something told me to go to the bathroom again, so I did. And just when I got in I puked my hamburger that I had eaten earlier right up, so it wasn't that bad because it still tasted like hamburger. But after a while I was soo totaly lost I was laying on the side on the toilet just trying to get things straight again, I was really tired. And then all suddenly I saw a big shining bathtub, I thought that it would be great to lay down there, but then I realised how 'junkie' it would be so I stayed where I were, near the toilet :)
