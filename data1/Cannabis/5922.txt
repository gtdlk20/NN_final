To provide you with a little background I have been smoking bud since my sophomore year in high school when i decided that maybe the DARE program really was bullshit and casual marijuana use might not be so bad after all. Long story short i enjoyed it so much that i didn't stop and eventually left for college. During my time in my hometown hotboxing cars was almost a tradition. Of course this is borderline retarded since its probably the most obvious way of getting stoned. Somehow this never backfired and I had avoided trouble with authorities altogether but of course you can't be lucky your whole life.
