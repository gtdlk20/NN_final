When the car revs to life, I panic. Benny was going to drive stoned--totally blasted. My voice finds its way past my teeth and I say no over and over again, telling him that we would get caught if he drove, that it was stupid. And somewhere in my gut I knew that this would happen--something like this would go down. We stank of weed, none of us were in our right minds, smoke billowed out of the windows. John and Michael tell me to relax, that I'm being irrational. I think the only thing that gets me to stop flipping out is Michael's assurance that Benny was one of the best stoned drivers he'd ever seen. When the car moves down to the stop sign, I put my hands over my face and lay down, head resting next to John's thigh and eyes shut tight. He leans down and asks if I'm okay and am I having a bad trip? My answer comes out strangled and tight. No, I am not okay.
