It was like any other day. Sunny, beautiful, around 70-80 degrees. I was with some of my closet friends and we decided to smoke before we went to work out (smart idea, right?). So we smoked as we always do: We picked up a Dutch Master (blunt) and rolled about 2-3 grams of what my friend described as 'purple haze'. I'm still not sure if the marijuana was bonified 'purple haze', but I have smoked many many many different types of marijuana from around the WORLD (yes, I've smoked local herb from different countries and almost every state in the union), so I feel like I am capable of handling anything in 2-3 gram doses. I have no reason to believe that it was laced with anything toxic, since we smoked more of the bud after I had my 'experience'.
