I spent a long time juggling and found that I was able to juggle EXTREMLY well while under the influence.  In fact I found that my performance seemed to be enhanced.  I would attribute this to the fact that the marijuana allowed me to free my mind from what I was doing.  It is well known among jugglers that if you start to concentrate on any single move you are doing, you will screw up a trick.  My previous record for consecutive behind-the-back throws was 3 in a row.  In one hours practice I shattered my previous record and pulled off 11 consecutive and smooth throws, much to the surprise of C's mom.
