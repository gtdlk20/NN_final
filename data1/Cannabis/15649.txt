I was looking at the street lights when all of a sudden the poles they were on began to bend over.  This seriously freaked me out as I had never heard of people hallucionating on weed before.  Then I looked to my friend to ask if he could see it and his face took on the form of a penguin.  I was seriously wacked out so i decided to make the best of it and just enjoy it. We were walking in when suddenly the school zoomed out away from us about 100 yards.  Then it zoomed in again about 2 minutes later.  So we went inside and it was about 2 hours from liftoff so I was definetely out there somewhere.  We got in on the dance floor and another peaceful wave hit me only this time it wouldn't recide.  It just got stronger, stronger, and stronger until it stayed there at the same level for about an hour or so.  All the while I saw patterns in things, not like out of nowhere like on acid or anything, but simply on tye-dye shirts or on the paint on the walls etc.  I would have spells where i would just stare at them and talk to them.  Then I got upset because a gnome I saw on a table wouldn't talk back to me (people must have been staring terribly).  So I decided to go outside for a minute and calm down.  Outside I discussed the dismemberment of the Grateful Dead with my friend (both of us being deadheads).  So after about 10 minutes or so I went back inside.  When I got on the dance floor, it just went on forever.  It was infinite, never ending, until I saw the DJ and he was at a point that looked like the edge of the plane.  I went up to where he was only to find it went on forever still. I was amazed.  It was like a revalation that went through my body.  I suddenly tied it to the possibilities of life being infinate and ever changing.
