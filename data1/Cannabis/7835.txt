First I was rolling joints - but then I figured it was too meticulous job & since I didn't have anything else, I used a souvenir-intended ethnic-looking HUUUGE tobacco pipe. Nevertheless I stuffed it to the top (Equivalent of 2.5 well stuffed joints) ! I wanted to get fucked up - and I did. I smoked it all in a smallest possible period of time - to get a better result. I turned the music on - 200 Hrs of playlist music on PC on random was good enough - I figured!!! First I was disappointed bcs I didn't seem to be as fucked up as I wanted to - but as someone noted in another report - everyone who thinks he's not fucked up enough - gets ironically fucked up PROPERLY!! Just for you to imagine - I couldn't even open the door of my room properly - I think I was staring at it for 5 minutes before even touching the knob, I couldn't walk or hold anything - it took a great effort to move around the room. While my mind was still trying to analyze the received info that happened 1 minute ago - I was already doing something else - which was eventually partially processed another 1 min later !! And so on.
