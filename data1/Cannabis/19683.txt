As I continue falling I tried to calm myself and I started to feel like I was falling through membranes. I started to feel like I was falling through membranes. Every membrane was a state, like I was growing or maturing, from one human condition into another state. As time passed and I continue to fall through this stage, I felt simpler, like a speck of dust lost in space. No longer feeling the need of everything I left behind in my previous life.
