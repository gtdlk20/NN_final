A thought entered my mind that perhaps I would regret doing this. I soon found myself traveling through space and time, which now merged insanely. One moment it took centuries for a single second to make it's pass, the next it seemed like hours could have been milliseconds. I began to think that I was moving at the speed of light and had the dire need to 'catch up to my body' but felt like I was moving too fast at the same time.
