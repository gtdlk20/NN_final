After that I started to become hungry. I dont know if it was purely due to the effects, or because it was the time I was supposed to eat, but because before not long ago I ate two small hot dogs, I thought I was so much hungry due to the effects. So I needed to go out and purchase something to eat. I started counting the coins. I didnt have any problem at the larger denominations, but I had trouble counting all the smaller ones, so I quit and did it again for three times. Finally I got just more money than I needed to be sure and went down to buy something. In the elevator, I was constantly checking if indeed the keys I got were the right ones.
