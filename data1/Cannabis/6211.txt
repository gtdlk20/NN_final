The third time was my favorite. By this time I had come to accept that I had no control over what happened to my body when I get too fucked up, and when it started the only thing that really scared me was the fact that I was at a concert. My friend J and I were at an ICP concert. I had drank four Smirnoff Ices, and we smoked two or three bowls from a metal pipe. When we finished smoking J left me to go find a good spot to see the concert, I didn't go with him because I could feel death taking over me. When my hearing left me I decided to take the initiative and make this as easy as possible on myself. I got off the table I was sitting on, for fear that I would fall off of it if I didn't, and sat down in a corner where I could relax. My vision went as the music started.
