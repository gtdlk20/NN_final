I should preface this tale with a bit of background about my drug experience.  Though IÂ’d smoked a reasonable amount of weed in my life and experimented with E and meth, at the time of this experience I had ZERO experience with hallucinogens and was caught completely off guard by what happened.  That undeniably had a profound impact on what ensued.
