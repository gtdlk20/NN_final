I walked outside towards the woods after everyone got busy with a game of pool and noticed that I felt completely different than I had with everyone around me.  I felt a complete peace about myself that I had never felt before.  I found a comfortable place and lay down in the woods.  There was a sense of oneness with nature.  I felt like all the trees and bushes and the few rays of sun lazily drifting through the canopy were saying to me 'here we are, now you know the secret to seeing us, you are no longer an outsider looking at us, you are part of us.'  Colors were exceptionally vivid, and my sense of wellbeing was phenomenal.
