My friend was still hungry so we decided to go to the grocery store and put in eye drops while we were there. The bathroom at the grocery store was a white room with white tile. This scared me. I felt like I was in the movie 1408 and would never escape the room. I needed to leave the room. The floor started to move in a curvy motion like a snake. I was so relieved to finally leave the bathroom. Inside the grocery store, my friend decided to go get some food. We were standing in front of the goldfish when she declared, I want goldfish! right next to an elderly man. Wheres the goldfish aisle? she asked me. I shrugged my shoulders. I still couldnt make words to tell her they were right in front of her. (she later explained to me she was looking for the flavored goldfish rather then the original ones in front of her)
