If I could only force myself to stop reporting everything and intellectualizing everything and just watch and pay attention and perhaps be an active participant (interactive hallucinogenic lucidity is the next level) I might be able to get even deeper into this realm and find out where those peripheral visions lead. That being said, I feel a sense of triumph, as if I've solved a riddle. I've synthesized the meaning of the experience so far. Of course, it's only the first riddle. Stranger and more difficult riddles lie ahead for me, and their solutions maybe require more than a poem or a trip report. They may require action, whether physical or mental, I don't know.
