Ever since then Ive been much more accepting of other peoples beliefs, ideas, and arguments, because I know their minds all work differently, and nobody is ever going to act just like me.  The most amazing thing was seeing that my entire physical life, from birth to death, was just the tip of the iceberg of my existence.  Im pretty convinced now that who we are extends well beyond these human shells we inhabit.
