Time(approx)12:00 - The cannabis resin seemed a bit different to the usual that I am used to, the normal stuff for me is dark brown in colour, where as this was of a pale yellow hue.  Even so we all chewed our pieces to experience the unique taste of bitterness which I can only describe as a petrol like taste (the resin was probably mixed with petrol?).
