Raz and I yet again play some WarCraft III before deciding we should just hold it off for now and get some music ready. We begin to set out our musical collection for the roll. We also picked up the room some so we wouldn't break shit. Then we headed out to the living room to watch TV and chat with those still around. Finally, BMF and Sicily finally came back with the goods. Just like one of the three wisemen, BMF sat down, opened his little baggy, and showed us the sixteen rolls he had gotten a hold of, as well as the relatively larger amount of hydro. Splitting them up into baggys and passing them out, BMF then told us that he was going to someone elses house to hang out for a bit, as was everyone else. Minutes later, Raz and I were the only ones around again, but we still had a friend on the way. About half an hour later, maybe a full hour, Grunge showed up with his girlfriend. His prime motive for the visit was to play some WarCraft III, so I got it set up for him and watched him play. Then, quickly and quietly one o'clock stopped by, and we got a phone call. The others had dropped their pills. It was now our turn. Taking a cue from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas I turned to Raz and said, 'As your attorney I advise you to follow me into the bathroom.' It was not one-oh-five, and we were going to digest our disco biscuits.
