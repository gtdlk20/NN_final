But as the reunion drew to a close, we wanted to continue the party in the big city. And so we did, but not before a quick trip to 'Christiania' (the 'freetown' in Copenhagen, much like a mini-Amsterdam, I guess). There we bought two nice hashish cookies. Nothing new about that, we have been eating cookies many times. But these were not the cookies we were used to.
