Upon hearing this story, some people tell me the weed was laced, but everyone else who smoked it that night can attest that this is not how it was.  I would recommend to those whove never smoked the herb before that its not always a party drug, for some people its a very spiritual experience, and a party atmosphere will only dampen, and possibly ruin a potential trip.  Try it for the first time someplace quiet, not in public, and with good people.
