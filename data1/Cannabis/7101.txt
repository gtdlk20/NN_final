We walked on to the race course track and decided to have a race and run back to the main road.  By now I was as about the most stoned as I have ever previously been; thoughts seemed to be flowing through my head at twice the usual rate, my heart rate had increased noticably, my body felt quite sedated and I was in a nostalgic dream-like state where certain things would conjour up a childhood memory that I probably don't even have. The concept of time began to feel somewhat disorientating, but the height of the sun in the sky aided the natural clocks we have in our heads.
