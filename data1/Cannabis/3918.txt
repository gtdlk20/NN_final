Me and my buddy H. Went by his place to roll up a joint and watch some cartoons, which is part of our weekly routine. This time though he told me about this new strain he got, which was supposedly... Mind-blowing. I was very excited and we ended up rolling a 4 gram spliff. H. Didn't smoke a lot, just took one puff, and I smoked all the rest. I wasn't aware that I was going to experience the most frightening and the most euphoric moments of my life all in one night.
