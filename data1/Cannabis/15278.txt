About 30 minutes later, I was well on the way to a trip that I can only compare to about 50%-75% of an acid trip.  It kept getting more and more severe, complete with tracers, an inability to speak, an inability to stand up or even concentrate on anything.  Wasn't a very cognitive high, more of just an experience kind of high.  VERY unsimilar to smoking it.  After the experience, I don't think I'll ever smoke it again, I'll only eat it.  I was never a huge fan of the smoking side-effects anyway.
