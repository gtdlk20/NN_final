An incident very similiar to the one that occured in real life, happened to my friend in the game. He was running around the third island (the only island with an airport) when he found a few people walking around. He nonchalantly pulled out his shotgun, shot them both dead, and then ran for a random truck. After this had taken place I began to talk about how things of this nature would never happen in real life. One man would not randomly go somewhere, shoot two people, attract all manners of the cops, secret service, SWAT team, and any other law enforcement agency. As I was saying this, he ran into a woman who, before being shot, screamed, 'Do you have a diet soda?!' So, naturally, as everything I had mention the night before was present in this news story, I took it upon myself to yell through the house, 'Do you have a diet soda!?!' in my best woman voice. Again, we both died of laughing fits.
