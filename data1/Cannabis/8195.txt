i spent Monday in a semi-haze all day and didn't really feel normal until like 7:00 pm, or t+49 hours.  i got a lot more than i bargained for on this one.  i'm glad it turned out ok and that i didn't do something outlandish in the middle of a catholic church service or get lost in Jersey (or the city for that matter).  This was unfortunately not much a growth experience due to the fact that i was asleep for almost all of it.
