From this point on I began drinking more water than usual and I purchased a 40 dollar system-cleansing drink from a vitamin shop.  I did not exercise or do much physical activity during this time.   I consumed the drink about 7 to 9 hours before the test, and drank a moderate amount of water after this.  About 30 minutes before the test I drank a large amount of water. When I took the test my urine was almost clear.
