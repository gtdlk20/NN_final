Emotionally it was also a very unusual feeling, before I got high I had a lot of stuff on my mind, but now I felt almost emptied of my emotions, but to replace that whole my senses seem so acute that I need every brain cell I could muster just to simply look around my room. I couldnt think of anything else, my brain was well, full. There was just enough room in my brain for my basic functions like breathing, never mind actually trying to speak.  I though about how weird language actually is, all it is is just sounds arranged into a familiar fashion so we thing that you can communicate with someone.  After some more pondering of life and staring off into nothing I must have fell asleep again.
