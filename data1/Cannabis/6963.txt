I've never been a huge smoker, but certainly had enough smoking experience to dispel any novice status, so when my friend got hold of a quarter ounce of what was described as top grade skunk I was more than willing to help him burn it up. So, four of us go along to a nearby park on the way home from college and begin to smoke. At the time I had been on a bit of a health kick so I hadn't smoked for a few months, and I remember the first toke hit me like a slap to the brain. I can distinctly remember thinking that this dope was obviously strong, but I wasn't aware of just how powerful it was until we got up to leave the park to go to my mates house which was about ten minutes walk away. The act of standing up took an almighty effort, and as we walked it felt as if our feet were set in concrete. At this point, we were all stoned to about the same degree, and the shared sense of intoxication soon resulted in the four of us laughing feverishly at any random object that passed by. An old man walking a small dog with curiously oversized testicles produced a particularly strong reaction.
