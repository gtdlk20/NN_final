It wasnt the first time I had smoked marijuana.  I have, other times, smoked from both pipes and doobies.  However, the effect hadnt been worth the time spent smoking it.  I think, however, that this was because I did not know how to partake of the herb.  In other words, I was inhaling wrong.  One must breathe it in, not suck.  Inhale from your lungs, not your mouth.  Suck it down until it starts to itch.  You may want to cough.  Dont.  Stop the hoot, and pass the pipe off, without exhaling.  Suck in some air quickly, so that your throat doesnt itch as much.  Hold the smoke in your lungs, not your cheeks, for about ten seconds, maybe longer, and then exhale slowly.  Breathe a bit.
