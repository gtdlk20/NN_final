Conclusion: I believe this was a completely mental episode. Even though I felt physical pain, it stopped the moment I left the gym, where I had felt uncomfortable in the first place. I'm also open to the possibility that my endorphins released from working out might have clashed with the chemicals in the marijuana we smoked right before we got in there. Either way, this was the most terrifying experience I've ever had, and it goes to show that I never know what I'm getting into. Marijuana is considered harmless (especially by me) but sometimes, in the right conditions, it can really throw me for a loop.
