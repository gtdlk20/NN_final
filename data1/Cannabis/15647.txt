About 15 minutes into dinner I felt this huge sense of relaxation and calm. Then when I lifted my fork to put some steak in my mouth.... BAM! I whipped the fork across the room and couldn't explain why.  At this point I was way out of my mind so I went to my room and downed about 10 or 11 shots of vodka.  My friend came to pick me up and couldn't believe how messed up I was.  He kept laughing at me and asking if I was ok.  I was like yeah whatever.  After about 1 and 1/2 hours after smoking up I felt another wave of the tinglies come over me.  Then when we were pulling into the school parking lot I was the happiest I had ever been.  I remember feeling so at peace with myself and everyone else around me.
