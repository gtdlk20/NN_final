Anyway, back to our jokes. Many times we told tales of how the stoner team would just weld a bong to their contraption, or simply make a scrap-heap pipe instead of what they were supposed to make. Then, Raz pointed out that on their white board for ideas and model designs, they would just have pot leaves and 4:20 scrawled all over the place. I then added that one of them would say something along the lines of, 'Dude...do you think they have anything I can eat around here?' and another one would say, 'Wait...weren't we supposed to be doing something?' Naturally, we decided it would be the best rated episode ever. Finally, the show was over, and we headed back to the room for WarCraft III. We began to play several games, each getting our asses handed to us by the insanely difficult computer opponents. We laughed and cursed and mainly blamed it on the drugs. Suddenly, things took a turn for the odd. A knock on the door could be heard, then the opening of said door. We knew very well who it was, but we weren't ready for what they had in store. We were playing and who comes through the door?
