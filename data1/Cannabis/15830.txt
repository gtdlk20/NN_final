After maybe thirty or thirty-five minutes, the first hallucinations occurred. The window became 3-dimensional - in other words, I could see things come out of the glass, it looked like a mountain all of a sudden. I was completely out of reality (note : I smoke in the dark, with only the light of the day - there is one, even at 1 am). I fell off my chair again, and when I wanted to find it again, I couldn't. I felt like I was losing my mind, because I couldn't find a big chair in such a little room.
