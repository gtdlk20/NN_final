My family didn't seem to mind that I was interested in drugs of all kinds since early childhood. By age 13, my mother dealt LSD in her school girls bathroom and was an intense druggie since age 11. My father was an alcoholic, my step father had tried every drug that I know of, from Cocaine to Crack to Heroin to LSD, he'd been addicted to it at some point in time. My brother's fate was much the same, so it comes as no shock that an interest wouldn't scare them at all.
