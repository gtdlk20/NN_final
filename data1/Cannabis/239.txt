Back to my first experience stoned after 25 years.  I felt the familiar buzz and fuzziness and a smile landed on my face that just wouldn't quit.  Kelly and I became really chatty and almost but not quite tripped over into uncontrolled laughter over nothing in particular.  Time seemed to slow down.  I remember the television was on and wished we had music instead.
