Hallucinations seemed to really take hold because my glasses had fallen off and I put them in my pocket. My cousin had to take them away later when I was trying to bend them like a twist tie in my pocket.  I dont have too bad of vision, but things really started to distort, especially in the darker backstreets of the campus.  Somehow, 2 full-size oaks became 2 scale-size statues of people, a garbage can became an old lady on a bench; Alfred Hitchcocks silhouette momentarily appeared in the shadow of a tree.
