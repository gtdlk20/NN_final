The water tasted so good in my mouth but the cotton mouth wouldnt go away. We decided to go buy sodas instead. The soda machine was a whole other complicated problem. I couldnt find the place to put the money in. I ended up jamming my dollar into the side of the soda machine against the hard plastic. If anyone had seen me they would have known something was wrong with me. My friend insisted that there was no place to put bills in but I saw it, it was right in front of me. Suddenly it disappeared and I gave up.  I bought a diet coke in the machine next to it. The coke however was impossible to drink. I sipped only about a teaspoon of it and it exploded in my mouth. It was way too bubbly and wouldnt go down with my dry tongue. Throughout the night I kept forgetting things my friend had just said to me and would forget what I was saying mid-sentence.
