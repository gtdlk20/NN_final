All of the sudden, about 100 feet in front of us, I saw a 80 or so degree curve in the road.  As we approached I became very nervous and was afraid we were going too fast to negotiate the curve.  I looked at the speedometer and we were only going 5 miles per hour but for some reason I screamed at my friend 'SLOW DOWN!!!'  As I said this I ducked my head down into my lap and prepared for a crash.  Of course, there was no crash, and in retrospect, the situation wasn't dangerous at all, but feelings of fear swept over my body, and once it was over, it was like nothing in the world mattered anymore.  Seemingly, I thought that if I had just survived that, that I was invincible and could survive anything.  I laid back in my seat and smiled and began to focus on the music playing.  For some reason, we decided to listen to classical music, and it was really quite beautiful, and kept us quiet the whole ride home.  Being an avid guitar-player, I really enjoy listening to music after smoking weed anyway.
