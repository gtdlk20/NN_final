Shortly after, I rose to my feet and claim my seat in my designated lawn chair. At this point, I put my headphones in and let the Technicolor sounds of Deadmau5 and Wolfgang Gartner caress my cerebellums third eye. It was finally opened. We sat there, rambling about nothing and listening to our iPods. Time flew by. I had no sense of time or space. It felt like a dream. Its sort of similar to when something REALLY good or astonishing happens and you arent even sure if it is actually happening. I wasnt even convinced all of this was real. At this point I realized I needed a ride home. We all packed into Fs grandmas car and the ride home commenced.
