When I came down, I felt reborn. I wanted to put my lessons learned into use. My life was going to be better from now on, I came back to school with a new mission. I made amends with all the people I had hurt. I got some wierd looks (apoligizing to somebody for something you had done 5 years ago will do that). And started to learn, not just be there. What were once D's and F's are now A's and B's. I have turned my life around, all because of a kind green bush that the U.S. government has decided must be outlawed because the think it is bad for people. It is because they do not listen to people like me. They refuse to hear the good, only the bad.
