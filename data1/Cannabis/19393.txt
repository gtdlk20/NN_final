The day started off cold and dreary.  I woke from bed and went to my friends house.  The friend whom I was picking up just turned 18 and wanted to buy something to smoke out of by himself, so I told him I would take him to a shop that sells them; and I did.  One of the grayest and colorless days I have ever known passed by us on that trip.  Once we got there we selected a nice straight bong with about a 2 inch mouth piece.  It fit my mug nicely as it did his.  We made the trip home talking quiet a bit how hungry we were, yet we didnt stop anywhere at all to eat which was a blessing in disguise I guess, it saved us money.
