When I sat down, I still felt that roller coaster sensation.  The euphoria I was experiencing increased at the same rate a roller coaster falls!  It was extremely intense, and so I panicked slightly for a minute until I finally just sat back and accepted it.  It was this time I decised the theory that the mind is an echo inside your head.  Individual thoughts themselves were just echoes.  I probably stated this because that's how thought itself felt; my mind felt like an echo you would hear inside a large cave. (Sorry, this is the best I can describe it.)  Speech wasn't self-controlled, it was automatic.  I simply could not control it, words just came out of my mouth. (Perhaps it triggered a dissociative effect?)  This sensation increased for at least 10 more minutes, but I went to sleep so it could have lasted even longer.
