So now we have our lines laid out. L looks down at his (keep in mind hes doing a double dose) and has a nervous laugh. I ask him whats up, and he replies (not wanting to freak me out) that he doesnt think hes ever done quite this much before. In L speak, that means it was a lot more than he had ever even thought about snorting. Maintaining his composure, though, he leans down and takes his line. Theres a pause, I look at his calm face slowly contort into a half amused, half miserable expression. He mutters something about how lovely it was, and goes into the bathroom to start coughing, gagging, and making some other lovely noises that are pretty impossible to describe.
