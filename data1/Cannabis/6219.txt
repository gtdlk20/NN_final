That's the thing with dying, while I'm falling deeper into it I feel like everything is lost and I'll never be happy or sane again, but then I fall out the other end and I see everything in a whole new light. My perception on everything is different for the next few days after my death, but I do get back to normal eventually. My reason for writing this is so that just in case anyone else out there experiences death like I do, I want them to be able to understand it and not be afraid. The more you worry during it the worse it's going to be.
