I decided I'd go to sleep with this knew-found knowledge, but the falling feeling came back when I closed the lights. It felt like the light was what would pull me up into happiness, understanding and that darkness would send me to the pits of hell, the falling feeling, which was hell. The big drop. To death. I comforted myself by repeating a single thought: 'There always is a surface to fall on. It is a circle. It is endless. Even if you die, you will wake up and fall on something.' I managed to go to sleep after that.
