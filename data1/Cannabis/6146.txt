I'm a 16 year old white male, not on any medication, without any (known) allergies and on this particular night, I had the house completely to myself. As soon as I was alone I grabbed the almost completely full baggie of bud and proceeded to get my shit together in preperation to enjoy. Although my parents were particulary bohemien in my upbringing, especially my mother of whom I speak openly about drugs with, I felt it was best to hide my smokables and such from them. I feared that if my parents found my weed I would almost certainly be sternly told 'I'm not mad, I'm just dissapointed' which hurts so much more, so naturally I wanted to avoid this as much as humanly possible. So, to recap, I have weed, equipment to make a smoking device and a free house for a good 12 hours.
