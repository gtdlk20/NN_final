The whole trip seemed to revolve in time frames. For every second or so (it felt) that I was somewhat aware of myself physically, emotionally, etc., I was instantly forced to snap into another time frame that seemed to last forever (from periods of 2 to 5 minutes that seemed like hours, until I reached periods that lasted years!). I couldn't remember the last time frame I experienced and there seemed to be a lot of gliches. I couldn't walk and I couldn't communicate. I had reached a point where I felt I was living within my mind and its understanding of time, which is drastically altered from repression. It was very scary at first, but once I started to understand when I was coming down just what had happended, I couldn't believe it, but I knew so well that I was not going to repress it, or anything, ever. I could not think as I was experiencing it or afterwards until I was coming down.
