My appetite became larger and larger. My stomach was like a never-ending pit. I ate 6 pieces of pizza, some mini ice cream sandwiches, and a hot pocket. I was still hungry. After feeding our gluttonous selves we smoked more. At this point (about 1-2 hours after the initial smoke) I started feeling an extremely painful headache. Stupid high me thought, 'Well it will go away if I get more high.' Well, it did go away, for about an hour. After that the headache just got worse and worse throughout the night. My skull was pounding, I was hungry, tired, yet I couldn't sleep because of my headache. This is the first time I've experienced an extreme headache of this sort with weed. Before we smoked my friend said it would be the most potent weed I've smoked and I COMPLETELY underestimated his warning. My brain throbbed and the coming down process seemed like it took days. Nearly 12 hours after the initial smoke the headache finally ceased yet my mind still felt very fuzzy.
