At this point they decided it was time to head back to the dorms, so I once again stood up and got ready to go. By now, the visuals had gotten nearly out of hand, as each frame of reality was nearly spiraling through me, such that my peripheral vision was completely whited out. As I stood there waiting to follow my companions back, this effect increased dramatically, until nearly everything was fading to white! Finally, the only remaining vision I had was of my roommate standing right in front of me, everything else was white. Doubts and fear flew through my mind, but I tried not to make a scene.
