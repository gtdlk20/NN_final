Finally, the effects began to become less intense, but were still painfully present. I still felt detached entirely but the uncontrollable spazzing had ceased and it was easier to talk. I might have passed out at one point, it is hard to say, but I do remember waking up and thinking I was hearing a guitar lesson going on below me and that sound of a learning guitarist and his teacher talking and then playing being a very nice feeling that made the return to reality and the eventual repossesion of my body calm and beautiful.
