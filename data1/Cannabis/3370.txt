Whenever I moved from one place to another  the kitchen to my bed or the bathroom  I was intently aware of this movement. I suppose in a sense it was as if I was experiencing these simple, day-to-day movements as if they were new. I sat on my bed for a while longer, still very freaked out by it all. Because it was such a new experience, I wanted to check my sanity, reassure myself that things were okay, so I would frequently check my watch on my mobile phone to see that I could understand things and that time was ticking by as it always did!
