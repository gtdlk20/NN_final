This is not to say that I endorse or recommend performing while high, particularly not classical music, primarily because the lovely, languid, eased out feeling of being blazed can interfere with focus, concentration, and memory. Personally, I have rarely performed while stoned, though I know many successful opera singers who frequently go on stage while stoned.
