Then we went inside, and decided to go sit in some couches. In the mean time, L was extremely stoned. Unfortunately it was the kind where you simply sit, look blankly into space and dont say anything. Every once in a while, he would say 'wooow man, I'm so stoned', but nothing more. I on the other hand was babbling away with a couple of other friends that came to sit with us. At this time, about an hour after we smoked the joint, I began to experience strange things. I was having deja-vus, and I was having them every 10 seconds for about half an hour. I would be talking, going 'blabla...wow! again !...blablabla...wow ! again !' for half an hour.
