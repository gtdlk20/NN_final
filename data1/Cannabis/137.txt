In general things took slightly longer to do, either that or I was more impatient. But since things also tended to move a bit slower it was actually ok. It wasn't difficult to perform any tasks, just a bit annoying that they seemed to take longer time than usual! I started noticing that I kept forgetting what I had just done. But it was very easy to recall again, I just had to concentrate a little and call it back 'manually' so to speak. This feeling of things my body normally does automatically becoming something I had to do manually would be the most recurring notion during this experience.
