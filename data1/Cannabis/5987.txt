I see now that my experience was worthwhile and was significant to my own personal revelation and testimony I see the importance of all things, and that God gave man, that man might use to better himself and glorify the father I thank God every day for giving me my unstable, yet stable mind to conjure and realize these things I have grown from my experience and am now more so wise than before I believe that man should not follow the law of man, but the law of the land, and that is: Do not Harm. Everything else falls under that rule alone.
