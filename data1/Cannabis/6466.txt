I belive it was around one year ago when this all happened, by then I had been smoking weed everyday for a few years. No problems with the drug at all, no paranoia or panic attacks and whatnot. So this day started out as any other, although I didn't have the urge to eat anything, just drank some coke and ate a few chips all day. So 10 pm rolls around and my friend who lives down the street from me calls me up and invites me to go over his house to smoke a blunt with him and a few of his friends. Not being one to pass up a free smoke I gladly jumped at the chance even though I was feeling quite hungry at the time. A few minutes passed and soon I was in my friends garage making small talk with everyone there. A few more minutes went by as my friend broke up the weed and rolled the blunt. When he finished we sparked it up and began the rotation. Everything was completly normal as I felt very comfortable in my surroundings. The usual feelings of being high slowly began to occur, and the usual 'cotton mouth' followed soon after. It took around 15 to 20 minutes to finish the blunt off and I was feeling very relaxed and pretty stoned. All seemed well, yet I tended to notice that my stomach would not stop growling. I just shruged it off and figured I would have something to eat when I got home.
