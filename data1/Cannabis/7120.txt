My fears hit me. It was my mum.. tea time!  My heart skipped a beat when I beheld the thought of communication; what a feat that would be, standing up and getting down the stairs was an achievement.  I made my way into the kitchen, guided by the scent of freshly cooked pizza.  I was terrified, like a young child banished to the headmasters' office.  My heart was still pounding but I was glad my tremors had died down.  I spoke a few words, as to cover up my 'secret', which probably only added to the suspicion.  My mum was technically two feet away.  Really I was in space and she was on earth.  She didn't show any signs that she knew I was stoned.  My older brother didn't help though; grinning at me and making gestures resembling smoking pot.  In my head i was going crazy with him because I thought he was giving the game away, but physically I just looked at him and walked back up stairs with my pizza.
