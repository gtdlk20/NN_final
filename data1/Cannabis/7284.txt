My views of life, people, society, and law have been totally changed by my marijuana use.  Mary Jane has helped me to realize that the important things in life are love, and happiness, and the way we treat others, not how much money we make, or how big our houses are.  I regard this change as an extremely positive one.  I have been given great insight by my use of the ganja goddess, and I hope that this article will encourage other individuals to use marijuana responsibly, and for the right reasons.  If you do so, you will open doors in your mind which will enrich your life, and give you a greater perception of the everyday world which many people are never able to grasp.
