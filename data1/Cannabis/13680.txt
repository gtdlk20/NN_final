Ok well I'd first like to start off saying that I was an expeirenced cannabis user for about 2 years, everyday or every second day smoking cannabis for about 2 years steady. I used to love the 'highs' I got from smoking cannabis, it used to make me feel good, and I could hold my tokes in and get really high, but a nice high and comfortable and never usually 'too' high.
