I HIGHLY suggest to anyone to try cannabis at least once,  it is not very addicting, and no, it is not going  make you go 'crazy' and  regret the night you have. I'm not saying that YOU HAVE TO SMOKE WEED  or that you won't get out of control if anything happens to you, it's your problem, not mine, but I do suggest trying it once.
