I was the first one to smoke.  I lit up and inhaled deeply, being the experienced smoker that I am.  This had to of been the hugest hit of my entire life, because it forced me to double over onto the ground and cough the saliva up from the back of my throat.  I managed to pull myself up back onto my feet with the help of two of my friends.  The first thing that I did once on my feet was try to lick my friend Dan's face, since he was so close to me after helping me up.
