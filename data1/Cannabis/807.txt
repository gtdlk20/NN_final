Throughout this experience, I write a letter to J. It's full of typos, dyslexia, unintentional puns, and scrambled words. It's almost a new language - it resembles the distortion I heard when she was speaking to me during the first trip. My writing is a bit less articulate but a lot more creative. Every random thought that pops into my head becomes an immense insight, an explication of existence. I proceed to make up myths that explain the universe. Who or what is God? I thought I was God but now I think I'm Moses. I spin endless verses of image-rich poetry, one metaphorical idea flowing into another. My words shape the visual patterns around me. I'm painting my life with words. I'm in control. I was right the first time, I'm God, and I'm creating the universe with My words - profound nonsense, semantic sight, visual sentences. Artful gibberish.
