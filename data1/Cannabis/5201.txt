When we got back to the dorm, I was almost instantly back in my room. Where I picked up a rubber frog, a mountain dew, and Ovid's Metamorphoses. Anyway, L, who doesn't smoke, and doesn't know what it's like to trip out, called me and forced me to watch the movie 'Saw' with her. I had seen the film before and thought it was a little scary, and now that I was baked, I dreaded watching it. Anyway, to cut a long story short the movie felt like it took forever, and at the end I realized that the movie wasn't scary at all. After that I was sitting in L's room, and I was reading Ovid - which was actually more scary than Saw because the words were tough to read baked - when I dropped into a trance, and went catatonic for a few minutes. It was completely unexpected, and I think it might have been a result of the techno that L habitually listens to. The trance itself is completely impossible to articulate, and half forgotten because L started to shake me because she thought I had passed out. This wasn't cool, I jumped to me feet, turned around, chucked the rubber frog at her and dove out of the room. I ran down the hall laughing, I felt like I'd just dished out justice. She disturbed me when I was in one of the most awesome experiences of my life, so I punished her by throwing a rubber frog at her.
