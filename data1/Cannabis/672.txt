At first I didn't get much of a stoned sensation from these, just the first stage where you suddenly feel that everything's changed but looks the same, like you've popped into a parallel universe, with the only difference of brighter colours.  I managed to get this sudden feeling on my last puff of the last Jay - just in time.  After the Jays we relaxed a little, and I suddenly remembered my CD player which I had brought along in my college bag, the music I had was some Funk/Tech House. I put it on full blast over my headphones, so all we could really hear was some big distorted beats and no melodies.  Dave (who is normally into Death Metal) thought it sounded really Phat and I grinned and nodded in appreciation (I usually find that almost any music sounds fantastic when stoned).  It had taken about 15 minutes for us to smoke the Jays, and also listen to the music for a while.
