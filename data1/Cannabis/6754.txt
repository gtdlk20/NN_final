We continued along, more cars passed, but I could generally control myself because life was like a game, and I was in control. I didn't have to suffer for my actions, so I didn't care; which in turn totally let me relax. Still moving towards my friends house, I talked to him the entire time, at least I thought. I asked him something aloud, something along the lines of 'That's true eh? (I'm Canadian) and he said 'What? What's true?' I realized that the entire time I had been 'talking' to him in my head.
