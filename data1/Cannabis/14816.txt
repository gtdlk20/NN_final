Afterwards we went back inside where some sexual stuff happened with my girfriend and me (which I will skip describing). And the night lurked on. One more thing, really. I had no problem with munchies or paranoia, until on the way back, we saw a lot of blue flashing lights. It turned out there had been an accident, but I was convinced that I was going to jail. I expressed this concern verbally, once again to the amusement of my friends. We came home and they dropped me off at my house. Inside, still buzzing, I proceeded to have a 40 minute conversation with my dad, who I almost never talk to.
