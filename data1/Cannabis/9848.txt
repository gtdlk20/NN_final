One hour. Christmases, Halloweens, birthdays when you still got presents. Climbing trees and carnival rides. When you were happy with your body, your hair, the simple things that made up your world. Sounds became louder, I become obsessed with the noise my nails make as I scratch the bedsheet, and I waste at least twenty minutes just engrossed in the sounds I can make scratching various surfaces.
