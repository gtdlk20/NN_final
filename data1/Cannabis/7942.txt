So here's my experience of the night. The party was producing wonderful vibes...strange rotten looking smoke hovering around the ceiling... cottonmouthed faces... iris-less eyes... splendid stuff. Yet, they were soon disrupted...several unfortunate dudes had to go and start breaking things... this lead to a few bitchslaps and some painful knee-testicle contact... a beautiful advantage to being female. Although this problem was solved, it had set my spirits a bit low. Being a smart party host, I have learned that staying sober while crazed drugees rampage all over your property is the best thing to do. Yet, being in a bad mood at your own party is simply non-tolerable, in my opinion anyways.
