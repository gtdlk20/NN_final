The rest of the day was a blur but I remember the first of it, sitting in the car marveling how complex the scenery is when I realized I had no idea where I was.  I began to think we were near my house when I forgot why I was thinking what I was thinking.  I never had such bad short-term memory loss like that before.  I literally would think of one thing, and then either forget what I was thinking about in the middle of thinking it, or space out and just realize I was spacing ten minutes later.  I wasnt thinking I was high until right then and it just hit me I was stoned off my ass.  I couldnt do anything but just smile with a big grin on my face and giggle at nothing.  We were lost in the city for a while in the car, maybe about 45 minutes when suddenly I realized a road and yelled out of no where 'AAAHH HOUSE NEAR HERE!' I couldnt think of what to say and after a while it ended up we were nowhere even near the city anymore somehow, which to this day I can never figure out how that happened.
