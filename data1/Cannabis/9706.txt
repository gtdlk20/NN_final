The bleeding sensation was like streams of warm water being pipetted onto the right-back area and flowing down the side of my scalp in several directions.  It was a random bleeding and wasn't in synchronisation with my pulse so it might not have been blood, instead it might have been sinus fluid or something to do with my nervous system. This experience was september 2001.  It is now Jan 31 2002 and I still get the bleeding sensation to a lesser extent in the time between lying down and sleeping.
