At this point I realized how truly gone I was. I little later I raid his kitchen eating anything I can find and it added up to be, 3 donuts, 3 slim jims, a moon pie, a cinnimon bun, a brownie, some glasses of soda, and a few pop tarts. After that we are fucking laughing at each other for no reason. He is not nearly as high as I am and his brother doesn't feel anything at all. We ended up having a fucking marshmello fight taking turns hiding and pitching them at each other. I can't really remember what happens after that, but I remember his brother going upstairs and then me sitting down and seriously thinking about where he had just gone to. Me and my friend attempted to get some milk and donuts but I ended up laying on the floor not being able to breath from laughing so hard, because he took the last donut.
