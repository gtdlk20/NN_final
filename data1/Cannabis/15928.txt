I woke up the next morning and I was in my pyjamas, under the sheets. Even though I had been wearing my jeans and shirt and a belt that was fiddly to undo, I had still managaed to take it all off, put my pyjamas on, and get under the sheets. I don't remember any of this, so I must have done it in my sleep while still quite stoned.
