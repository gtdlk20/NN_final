As we made our way into the kitchen for snacks, almost immediately, it turned into a cooking show set, where everything looked so perfect and in place. I just stopped and stared, like I was nervous to be going onto a professionals set. J was the host of the show and he was showing me around with the spices and the drinks. Funny. He then ran onto his couch and put on the Fresh Prince, a show that is highly recommended for anyone thats new to smoking. We all sat down with cereal and as we were watching, an event occurred that I will never forget.
