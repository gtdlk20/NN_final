It started off with just strange thinking, lots of my own thoughts rushing around in my head which is the normal feeling I get when IÂ’m really stoned.  Now I started to think biologically, relating to my body, which I sometimes also do when stoned, I had began to develop dry mouth at the 4th hit and now I was thinking of this, and what caused dry mouth, this later developed into WHERE my dry was going (?).  I began to imagine and/or feel a warm creeping sensation of drying out mucus/saliva travelling its way into my left tear duct... but the thing is looking back on it now, I imagined the tear duct on the WRONG side of my eye.  Ironically the cold, harsh and DRY wind was blowing into the furthest part of my left eye, and I began to feel as if the wind was blowing the dry feeling into the rest of my eye: basically I began to feel as if my entire eye was drying up.  This obviously got me rather worried, perhaps slightly paranoid.  I tried to think logically about the situation and I thought that the pot might be just super-enhancing the 'feeling' of Red Eye.
