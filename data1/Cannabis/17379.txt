4:30 PM: The car pulls in at cousin H's place. I've got my weed in my pocket, along with my tweezers and lighter. Now, S had told me that H was big into weed so I didn't feel as if I should keep this from anybody or not, so I brought up the topic of pot so we all started discussing it and such. A couple minutes later, H's cell phone rings and it is supposedly her dealer that has called so S and I both looked at each other excitedly as cousin H said 'You ready for me to spend a hundred dollars? Yeah, I'll be there soon.' Cousin H got us in the car and we set out to the dealers house.
