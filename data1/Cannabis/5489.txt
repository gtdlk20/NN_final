Auditory hallucinations followed. Thinking back on it, I was hearing this stuff throughout the whole time we were sitting on the hill, but it took me until the end of the conversation to actually acknowledge that I was hearing it. In my right ear, I could hear some sort of gospel reggae music, if such a genre exists. It was very vivid and very loud in my ear and sort of calmed me down. I asked my girlfriend if she could hear the music and she just looked at me bewildered and said, 'What the hell are you talking about?' Then in my left ear, I was hearing some sort of a conversation. My mind was independently conversing with itself. It became hard to focus on what my girlfriend and I were talking about because I was trying to figure out what was being said in my left ear. When I focused on it, it seemed to me like it was something that I had said before, but I wasn't sure. It kept going on and on without my help and it became quite interesting to listen to.
