I was already in a jolly mood, having resently moved a bit further away  from the hectic life in the city to a small village, and had come to town for a party that was held in a commune that's a local legend for it's parties. I had been smoking my bong since waking up, and was already quite buzzed waiting for my friend who was to accompiany me for the party. On the phone he'd mentioned he'd gotten us something a bit more special, but since such things aren't talked straightly about on the phone, I had no idea what it'd be. LSD? Speed? In my spare time waiting I also drank a 75 cl bottle of 10% white wine and had a few hits from my Â½ l bottle of Jack Daniels.
