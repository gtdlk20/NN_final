Experience with Cannabis:  I have taken cannabis in the form of smoked buds, wax/dabs, hash, cannabis oil, store-bought edibles, homemade edibles, and store-bought tincture from a dispensary.  I have never had a negative or difficult experience with cannabis in the 15+ years of my relationship with this plant.  The closest to a difficult experience I can remember is combining it with alcohol and passing out, waking up to a nasty hangover.  Even with oral cannabis, in the past I had taken a little too much and just gotten couch-locked and fallen asleep early.  However, I have also never used home made tincture until this day.  My previous tincture experience was pleasant, and the recommended dosage had been fairly high- about 30-40 drops.  I had taken this amount frequently and had good experiences; I remember that tincture being not very strong.
