All of this was happening in my bedroom, with almost 0 ventilation, after several minutes the flame finally formed in the sheet, I took the joint and lit it up. All my bedroom was full of hash smoke and burned paper sheet smoke. I took 3 hits and all of a sudden when I thought it wasn't working and had finished THE WHOLE JOINT with no tolerance to hash, I started to feel my legs tingly/numb and my body became like really drowsy. I took a look at the mirror and I had my eyes ALL RED, I had trouble remembering what was I going to do at every moment and I was trying my best to clean my room (burned paper sheets, the soldering gun heatened up in the floor, joint ash everywhere). Right after finishing cleaning, my grandma who was on fucking AMBIEN woke up due to the intense smell that was coming out from my room and asked me what the fuck was happening, she knows little to nothing about hash or pot smell so I told her I was soldering something and the smoke that had came out went straight into my eyes. I told her not to worry and that I was going to sleep. She believed me and went to sleep.
