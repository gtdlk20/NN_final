By the time I got inside, I started viewing things in frames.  By the time I sat down to eat, my memories of getting and paying for my lunch were like snapshots my mind took, and all I could remember seeing was the stack of trays where I grabbed one, the salad bar, and the woman who was working the register that day.  Even now, that's all I can remember of lunch.  I thought it a little odd, only having experienced vision like that with much larger amounts of weed.  But I was in a good place by then, and didn't really care that much, so I ate my lunch and left for class.
