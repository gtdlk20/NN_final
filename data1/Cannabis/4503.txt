It was a normal day at school; same routine. After school I went to McDonalds to hang out with my friend. Lets call him M. You see, my friend M smoked pot, and I desperately wanted to try. M used to be a dealer, and ironically, he had no idea where to find any product. I thought my chance at finally getting high was lost, until M and I spotted our friend, whose name also starts with an M, but we will call him Fernando. Fernando knew a guy who sold some really good chronic, well call him G. Fernando hit his guy up and got the okay to drop by his house. We packed into Fernandos grandmas car (his was in the shop) and headed over to where G lives. When we arrived at Gs house he pulled out two bags of suspicious plant matter. This was the enigmatic wonderdrug that I had been dying to try. We smelled the bags, exchanged money for weed and headed off back to Fernandos house. I remember M making a remark saying, This weed smells like Gods vagina. I replied I love that movie. On the car ride back, M had revealed his metal bowl that was carefully concealed in the safety of his pocket. M packed the bowl. He took the first hit. Being the smoking noob that I was, I assumed it was like smoking a cigarette (no I dont smoke cigarettes, but Ive seen people do it.) I just lit the bowl, sucked in, and expected some crazy stuff to happen. Im pretty sure we smoked about 3 bowls on the way back to Fernandos house. Sadly, I thought to myself, Why would anyone do this? This isnt even doing anything. I wasnt feeling the marijuana work its magic. I figured it was a dud or I was immune. But my friends seemed to be acting pretty funny. I thought I might have been immune to the effects. But as aforementioned, I was a smoking noob and wasnt holding it in long enough. The car ride was uneventful.
