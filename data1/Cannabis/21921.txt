I tried lying down on my bed. Getting into the totally relaxed mood, I started feeling and hearing my blood trickle through my body. I knew exactly which route it was taking cos I could feel it, and this was complimented my some subtle trickling noise and another sound (can't remember) for when it was being pumped by my heart.
