While lying on Ts bed I began to feel a familiar burning/tingling in my chest. W00! We're on our way baby! The effects come on *very* slowly however, so much so that I wonder whether or not I'm actually getting high as yet. Time slows down ever so slightly as I get up and go to the kitchen for some popcorn.
