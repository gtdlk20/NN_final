Matt packs a small bowl. I looked at what he was packing and realized it was ALL shake. In my mind I was still assuming I could handle it.  He passes me the bong and the lighter and I REALLY light this baby up..for a good four to five seconds.  It's nice and milky and I'm so excited to take this hit. It's nice and milky and I'm so excited to take this hit. I unplug it and breathe it all in.....thats when the trip started almost instantly.
