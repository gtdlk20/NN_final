At one point I felt my hands were just automatically typing without me thinking, and the computer was responding to my messages. I didn't feel like I was chatting to a person anymore (this computer responding perspective didn't last too long). This is when I felt my mind seperate from my body. They were seperate entities with separate purposes. I had a vision of my dark mind and my dark body (separate), my mind remotely telling my body what to do. Wierd, hard to explain feeling. But it was actually quite profound. I would've thought a spirit/body separation would be more likely, which was half why it felt quite strange indeed.
