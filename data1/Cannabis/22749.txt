Whatever the case, the feeling was euphoric at this point, not really calm.  It took me at least three minutes to get up the hill, which normally would have taken only one or so.  I slipped a lot, since I was wearing Vans on a slope that most people would hesitate to even walk down, let alone ride a toboggan down.  When I got to the top, I then went down, very slowly.  I dragged my feet the whole way, without wanting to, and everything was very blank.  I could hardly see, and felt very mellow by this point.  I think I was beginning to force myself out of my state of mind.  When I got to the bottom, we decided to go.  I do not remember walking back up the hill, but I remember climbing a fence, and walking across a field, and thinking I was going to die of hypothermia, and thinking my friend was going to pass out.
