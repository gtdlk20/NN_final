I believe, however, that psychedelic drugs open up doors in the mind, and we experience and perceive things that we are usually shut off to. This would explain why DMT visions are so alike. It is possible, depending on what you personally believe, that all of us walked through the open doors in our minds that night, and experienced something of another dimension, as our minds and spirits caught a glimpse of that reality. I've never known this to be particularly true with cannabis, but this experience shook that ground.
