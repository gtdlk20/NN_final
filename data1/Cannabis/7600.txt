That hade me intrigued, so I used butane extraction to produce 40ml honey oil, which was then added to 40ml 95% ethanol (everclear), and heated until just before boiling. I then slowly dripped in about 20ml melted butter (real, unsalted butter, not margarine), sealed the container, and shook. This didn't quite produce an emulsion, so I added 5ml more ethanol, heated until the alcohol was boiling, added 5ml more melted butter, and shook like hell. This time, an emulsion formed, and I allowed it to sit, hot and open, overnight, where it cooled to room temperature, and most of the ethanol evaporated.
