In retrospect the quantity of THC that I had ingested was probably quite high, but the fact that I had gone from unconsciousness directly into a potentially overwhelming high without any transition made the experience even more difficult to get control of.  What may have added to the initial panic I felt was the fact that I awoke from what I think was a nightmare- but was the nightmare natural or my brain's reaction to the flood of THC it was experiencing?  In any case, my curiosity was satisfied.
