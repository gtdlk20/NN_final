The question was raised as to whether or not I was okay. Responding was an impossible thing. I couldn't talk. 'or maybe I can' I thought and then wondered if all my thoughts had actually been said. Then I remembered trying to speak and tell my friends what was going on, but it was so hard to truly communicate, sure I had that mystical feeling of being able to transmit all my thoughts, but something told me that wasn't reality; I was giving in to the sub-reality that my body was moving too quickly through. It felt as though I was talking too fast and too slow simultaneously. Words couldn't even be formed, I was just struggling to get a grasp of my body and to catch up to it's lightspeed velocity so that I wouldn't die.
