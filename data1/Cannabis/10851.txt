A little less than 10 seconds after I inhaled, I tried to stand up and I felt like I was one of those York Peppermint Patty commercials, where the guyÂ’s on the mountain and screaming. I was then thrown into a trance where I gathered around the water bottle on the ground and began making shouting noises at it, while dancing like a tribal warrior. I saw J step back but at that time I thought it was just because he was scared of fire.
