I found myself in what I could only describe as a transitional period in my life. My boyfriend and I new we were meant to be together for life. But we'd been fighting a lot more than we used to. I'd just quit my job, coming to the realization that I'd grown stagnant. That, along with it being the end of February, and being somewhat affected by seasonal depression my whole life, put me in a very difficult mindset. I'd begun to feel like I didn't want to do anything. Like there was nothing TO DO in life. I knew it wasn't true, it was just depression, and I'd had experience dealing with this sort of thing in the past with LSD. Yesterday however, I didn't have LSD nor did I know where to easily get it. I'd moved last summer and working 50 or more hours a week didn't exactly help me make friends.
