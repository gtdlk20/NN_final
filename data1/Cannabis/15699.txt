I snuck away to the bathroom because I felt I had to vomit. Dry heaves. I couldn't commit my body to release the evil. I kept thinking of what someone said to me about vomiting as a means of cleansing. More feeble attempts. My friend came in to check on me, and we decided to leave. I made it home and was finally able to release and give in to the vomiting and all was better. Lesson learned, don't fight the urge to spew. Purged and cleansed, I lied on the floor in the darkness, finally able to enjoy the space in my mind. No more bad thoughts. I continued hearing music from white noise and tried my best to remember the melodies so that I could tune in later.
