This time, I had about a thimble full of marijuana, chopped up.  Its hard to describe how much I had, as the common measurements (an eighth, a half-bag) change depending on where you are on the planet.  I had enough to make a small pile in your palm, about one inch high, one inch wide.  I got two bowls out of it, but that was a small pipe.  I was very calm, looking forward to the high.  This time, I decided, I would find out what it was really like.  It is important to be calm.  Dont do it if you are afraid of being caught.  I suggest doing it in a remote area, such as a campground, or your own home.
