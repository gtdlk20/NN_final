Around 4:00, I am finally able to put my glasses back on. I am feeling drained, but still stimulated by the drug. L and I set up a playlist intended to last for the next five hours. With the music taken care of, we have fun just talking about life, drugs, and what were experiencing. Around 5:00, we decide that its time to simply get comfortable, and enjoy the comedown.
