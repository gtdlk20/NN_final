Despite my complete lack of physical coordination, my mind feels as if it's sped up. Words come out of my mouth before I can think them, and my mind seems to be making up for my lack of reflexes and balance. I hear my girlfriend laughing about jokes that I do not remember thinking up, they just came from my mouth, and it disturbs me a little, but not so much that I want the feeling to end. I feel smart, beautiful, clever.
