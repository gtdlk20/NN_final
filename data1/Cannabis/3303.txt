I sat on my bed with my head between my legs, wishing the sensations would weaken, making it a fun high instead of a confining high. Though I wasnt particularly enjoying myself, its not that I didnt find what I was feeling interesting. I thought it was great. It was like seeing the world again. It was just that I was taking in a lot more than I was used to.
