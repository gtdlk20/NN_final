17 year old light drug user. I had been smoking for five years and was reasonably learned in the art of toking. Smoked perhaps three grams a week. Heavy caffeine user, somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 milligrams a day. I had occasionaly experienced with hallucinogens, although I was by no means a regular user. Drank rarely, perhaps five servings per month.
