Well, one day in July, I was at my swim club. I meet a guy. W got to talking and he said he had some dank nugs in his car. I agreed and threw in 5 dollars to compensate the cost. We approached his car. He packed the biggest glass bowl I had ever seen. We got to smoking. I didnt feel high towards the end. As soon as I got out of the car. That was when it all kicked in. My Beautiful vision of a bright day turned into a dark night. I got on my bike, and began to ride home. The color of the sky was changing with multiple different colors. As soon as I got to my home I realized that the high was extremely unmanagable. I went to my room,  turned on the tv and layed down. I watch a episode of family guy. As soon as I turned of the tv, I turned my head and my vision faded behind me. I closed my eyes for a little while. When I opened them up, I saw clocks all over my wall, everywhere. I went to sleep and that was it.
