We smoked two...maybe three large bowls of hydro, and we were toast. This is the kind of high many people experience let alone with someone else. We began to walk back to his room for a rousing game of 'stoned WarCraft 3'. As we go inside I feel the cold air blast me with a nova strictly aiming for the heat arising from my body. My body is sent into a minimal form of shot. The El Nino of temperature combined with the lack of food sent a straight overkill to my brain. Instead of my stomach screaming and crying for sustance my eyes go out. It works just as that. A small pixel of black suddenly swells and amasses an army of grey and black squares that engullf my vision, very similar to a fire diffusing through an entire forest. Now, instead of seeing the home and furniture that was before me, I saw a swirling and caccophany of light greys, dark greys and blacks impairing any vision I may have once had. I was not scared though. It was somewhat entertaining and it had happened once before, so I knew the procedure. I was hot..then cold...and hungry beyond any feeling I have had before.
