I then lost all balance and began to stumble rapidly to the side. Trying as best I could to regain my balance, but to no avial as just then I slammed into the trunk of a car that was parked in a neighboors driveway. Completely dissorented, I then stumbled immediatly the opposite way and fell yet again. But this time I hit the concrete sidewalk but was fortunatly able to break most of my fall on my arm which left quite a scratch on it. I tried to get back on my feet as soon as I could just in case someone who had seen me fall not think anything of it than me just having triped on something. I stood up only to have a small tree branch wack me right in my face. Oddly, after the branch hit me, my vision improved slightly to where I could see right in front of me and I yet again continued to walk home.
