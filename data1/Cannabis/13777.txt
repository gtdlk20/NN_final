I suppose you may know the feeling of a deja-vu, and I personally find it a somewhat creepy feeling. At the time tho, I was pleasantly high, and you could say that I was enjoying it, since it had never happened to me before. I dont know how I got those deja-vus, I guess the cannabis affected some area in my brain where the deja-vus are 'made'. But it was a nice experience nonetheless.
