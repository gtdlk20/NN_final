The night of 20th February was Mahashivaratri - the Hindu festival, night of the Great Shiva. On this day bhang (dried female shoots and flowers of Cannabis) are taken as prasaad. From the overwhelming spiritual nature of the trip I had on this day, I now suspect that astrology and especially the position of the moon also influence the nature of the trip that one gets on Bhang/Cannabis. The Hindu calendar is partially Solar and Lunar based and Mahashivaratri invariably falls on the night previous to a Amaavasya or New Moon. I still must look up whether shamans and spiritual practitioners in other parts of the world consulted astrology to time their psychedelic rituals.
