This is where things got messy. I had a good friend from high school, weÂ’ll call her S. Throughout all of high school, I was always very attracted to S but had stupidly chosen to pursue other girls, as S seemed too pious to ever consider with a relationship with a renegade like myself. I took her on a single date after we graduated (same year) and we talked several times on the phone during our first months at college. Of course I was optimistic, especially when we started writing letters to each other. But I was blindsided by the death of my friend, and I dropped off the radar, calling her only once more for her birthday.
