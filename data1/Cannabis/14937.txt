Sitting cross-legged in a sandy wash, I smoked most of the joint before deciding to head home. After the intense sensory 'strobing' started, I noticed the small, fine details around me, all the tiny wonders that we usually overlook. The feel of the fine sand, the crisp purity of the desert air, the simple pleasure of watching a lizard dart among the rocks. I had just read the Tao Te Ch'ing, and reflected on the wisdom of the sages in urging us to be more appreciative of the little joys in life.
