I went upstairs to my room and was not scared anymore. I felt happy and funny. I began to do an Asian warrior dance. I thought I was a samurai! After I was done, I could barely remember doing it at all. It was probably because 'I' wasn't doing it; my brain was controlling my movements. And I couldn't control my brain.
