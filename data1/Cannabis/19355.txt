The first part was me sitting down in an air bubble chair. I was thinking of me just sitting on air, and that must have affected my trip coming up. Here it goes. I was just sitting there thinking of things, and all of a sudden I was blocked in by bricks. Not regular bricks but air bubble bricks (the only way to explain it). The bricks were like the bubble chair I was sitting in. I could not possibly move, the bricks were holding me tight. I closed my Eyes thinking I could lose the trip, but as soon as I did I got sucked into a portal. A portal of infinite knowledge (as always as I trip). I drift and drift. It was telling a story, and a great one at that. Life is great, you have to hold on to the moments and create new ones. I was literally taking deep refreshing breaths just to savour the moment. I can't remember every moment of this experience so I won't ramble. Every time I trip it is spiritual and I learn more and more about the actual world that surrounds us all. I hope you have liked this if you didn't have a wonderful day anyway.
