After we had both finished our chips, we walked out of the chippie and went back up to the hill. Most of our friends had already gone home, and there was only a few other people sitting down, skinning up and smoking some joints. I never smoke joints because I feel the tobacco ruins the effect of the weed. I think this may be because I don't smoke cigarettes and I'm not really used to smoking tobacco like I smoke weed.
