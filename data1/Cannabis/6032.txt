My head begins to feel light, floaty, high.  It takes a little while to come on.  The next thing I feel is like Im in the back of my head, it's like Im watching myself from the vantage point of behind.  First I notice these sensations and before I know it Im gone. I speak to Perry and it's like Im not even speaking Im watching myself talk.  I'm not even sure where these words are coming from, how Im answering how this is sane and still working, because the real me is off in some other land, so who is it there able to have this conversation?
