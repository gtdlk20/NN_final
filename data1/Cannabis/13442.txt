I went to the bathroom, took a shit, and as I was washing my hands it was starting to hit me.  My tv was off.  No music was playing.  The lack of sound made me lose sense of time.  I couldn't tell if I was actually moving in slow motion, or if I was just perceiving it that way.  There was such an akward stillness in the air.  Sooooooo slllloooooow.
