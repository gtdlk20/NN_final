By god's grace we made it home in time for us to park the truck in the driveway, go inside and pretend that we hadn't left. John's mom came shortly to pick him up for wrestling practice and I stumbled with my back pack to get my homework ready for attempted completion. The sun was receding under the horizon and I scrambled to get my chores done in time before my folks showed up. For some reason I kept hearing voices, like as if a tv was on. Every time I looked in the den, the tv was off. Paranoia was sinking in, as I was fearing that I was never going to come down from this and my parents were going walk in at any minute and find me warbling in madness. Thankfully, by the time they showed up, I was coherent enough to carry a conversation, but my mother was raging pissed about something she found in a pocket of a jacket I had left in the car they took. Also my dad confronted me about using the truck, as it was apparent that I had moved it from its original location.
