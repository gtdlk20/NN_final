I have been using alcohol and marijuana since I was 12. Not daily, but I'd say about 2-3 times a week over that 6 year span. More recently, I have started to smoke about 2-4 grams of marijuana a day. I consider myself an obsessive person, but I have a very strong will and I am positive I can resist addiction, and have tested that by abstaining from drugs for random and long periods of times. I have only had a handful of 'out of the norm' experiences when high, including hallucinations and extreme paranoia. I consider these to be 'out of the norm' because my surroundings where a direct effect on my high. I have experimented very briefly with other drugs such as xanex (alprazolam) and cocaine.
