Breathing is getting very 'manual' again, especially when I write. It is like the effect is going up and down in intensity, like waves on a beach. The feeling has now entered my extremities: ear lobes, finger tips, mouth. Threads from a spider's web that I accidently walk into feel very detailed and complex on my forehead, almost like a chord played by a big orchestra.
