3:00. 'Holy fucking freak-flying flags!', I write. 'I've courted the universe for many years but now I've truly fallen in love with her.' I'm more content than I've ever been in my life. Now I feel it was a folly to yearn for stronger substances like LSD and DMT. If cannabis can do this, what the Christ else do I need? To pursue euphoria beyond this divine plateau would simply be hubristic gluttony. I keep a glass of water by my bed to stave off dry mouth, but I keep knocking it over and spilling it on my papers, my bedside table, and my bed sheets. It doesn't really matter. I get to sleep at around 3:30.
