So my father experimented both with indoor and outdoor cultivation, and settled to do it outdoors in some concealed spots. The plants were of the White Widow variety. The first one grew well, but as they say, a weed is difficult to kill, but also difficult to make perfect, and so production on the first try wasnÂ’t so good. The next plants were more productive. The plants need a lot of light, water and fertilizer to be really healthy and productive. So I find the term weed not to describe them accurately.
