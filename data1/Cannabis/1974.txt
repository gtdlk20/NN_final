T+01.10 I make a ham, mayo & pease pudding sandwich then eat it  delicious  so much so I make another. I have a noticeable tingling up my spine & the nape of my neck. This is feeling quite luxurious now. No visual effect to speak of it just feels good. I consider redosing; I consider for about 5 seconds then decide.
