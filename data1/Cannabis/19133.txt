That, combined with the fact that I felt like I was in a film, made last night one of the strangest nights of my life. I think I enjoyed it, though I think I would have enjoyed it more if Kathy and I had spent most of the night in a place where we knew we were going to be safe, such as one of our houses (both of our sets of parents were home, which is why we stayed out until it wore off a little, and that took about three hours).
