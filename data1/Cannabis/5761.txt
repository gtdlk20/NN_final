I am artistically talented at both dance and music, 2 precious gifts that I treasure with all my heart. When I am inspired, or suddenly get a concept or idea of art, I am for that moment either in a trance, overwhelmed by an immense feelin of bliss, or am energized by an incredible adrenaline rush, and then I imagine the art, whether abstract or followin a concept/idea, and I have the urge to put the most beautiful thing I have ever come up with down into the real world, and appreciate my wonderful creation.
