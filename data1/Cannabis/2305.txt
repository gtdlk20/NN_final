I noticed that I was blinking often, and my eyes seemed to run like a projector that only showed every third frame of a movie, while running at a 40x minute speed. I would look at moving objects, like the water of the shower, and then wonder what theyd look like when my eyes caught them again in the next visible frame. Even weirder, my actions didnt look normal. Every time I did anything, for instance, raised my arm, Id see an old medical diagram in my mind of a mans arm moving, complete with a small script letter at the bottom that said Fig. 1. But it wasnt just one picture. As I moved my arm the picture switched to a different diagram of the arm in a different position, my current position. And the pictured would stack on top of each other, and remain numbered, increasing, I think through Fig. 40.
