I live in a suburb of a major city and have been smoking cannabis for about two years.  Usually it is locally grown 'schwag', which is sometimes good, and sometimes isn't.  When I have the money, I buy locally grown hydroponic marijuana, but this is not very often.  I have not taken any prescription drugs or any other drugs except for Ibuprofen (Advil) in 3 or more years. I do not engage in any other drugs except for marijuana and alcohol.
