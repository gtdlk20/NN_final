I was filled with happiness: I was happy to be with my boyfriend and I was delighted to finally be high. He repeatedly asked me Are you sure youre high? and I would just nod my head up and down. Everything was happening so fast yet the time seemed to drag on and my thoughts just continued to go faster and faster. Out of nowhere I asked to hear the Zelda Theme Song  I dont even play that video game. I was in amazement at everything, all of this seemed so new to me, I was looking at it all in a new light. I was speaking my mind, at least thats what I think I was doing. It was as if I was thinking out loud, but I needed someone to reassure me. I wasnt sure if I was talking or if it was all happening in my mind so I continuously asked if I was being heard or not. And I kept apologizing because I thought I was talking too loud.
