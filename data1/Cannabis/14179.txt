I am, or was, afraid of halucinations, and still have no urge to try any other substance.  Curious?  yes... willing to try?   no. Im not sure why, it just doesnt seem right to me.  After seeing the tennis bit, i shot up.  Sitting straight as a board, my mind came back to zero. Then i realized what had happened, i was hallucinating.  It took me a moment to realize that i was SAFE.  Around friends, in a house with no worries to speak of.  I lied back down and tried to find that place again.  (t+1:15)  I found it!!!  it came back in full force and this time, willingly took a ride.  This lasted for about 15 minits more...until i could no longer keep my experiance to my self.
