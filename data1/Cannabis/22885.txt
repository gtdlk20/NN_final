As soon as we lit up, we could feel the good times roll. After a few strong puffs, we were all absolutely f**ked. My English friend thought he was an explorer and started to swim accross the front lawn. Needless to say, the hilarity sent us into huge fits of uncontrollable laughter. Then, when it eventually subsided a little, I honestly started to believe I was a monkey. I sped around the room like monkeys do making the kind of noises monkeys do. We thought it was hilarious although one of my friends wasn't quite so impressed when I ate all the bananas out his cupboard but hey, I had the serious munchies.
