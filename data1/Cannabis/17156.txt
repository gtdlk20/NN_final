Last night I had the most amazing marijuana high of my life so far.  It was unbelievable.  I've been smoking pot quite regularly (daily, often multiple times daily) for about 4 months, and had not as regularly smoked for about a year.  So last night 2 of my friends and I smoked up at about 10, 2 bowls and then 10 minutes later another 3 and I was quite high.  At about midnight I went to bed and decided to smoke up first.  So I smoked about 3 bowls to myself and got into bed.  And it was incredible, I just lay in my bed listening to music and felt my whole body numb and tingling, the music reverberated in different parts of my body and I had waves of sheer euphoria.  It was reminiscent of MDMA in that way, I almost felt like I was rolling.  At one point as I lay there focusing on my intense body buzz I got really frightened because at this point my teeth and entire jaw felt paralyzed with this intense tingling - it felt amazing and I just talked myself down and into how unbelievable I was feeling and how awesome this was.  I don't know how long I lay there until I fell asleep (and dreamed the most vivid crazy dreams) but it was absolutely wonderful.
