Well, to end this tale on a high note, Ill say that while smoking, it is highly entertaining to watch it turn different colors. With regular, good weed, the bowl part turned dark amber, almost gold. With piff, the level of hash on it made it dark gray with gold only on the neck. Its very beautiful to look at.
