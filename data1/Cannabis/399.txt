I can barely speak but manage to get across the main point that Ive taken something psychedelic.  I tried to express that I hadnt known what it was that I was smoking but Im not sure if that got across.  I started listing outloud every hallucinogenic substance that I thought might have an outside chance of being smokable.  LSD, PCP, K, Opium, Shrooms, Mescaline.  What had I taken into my lungs and bloodstream?
