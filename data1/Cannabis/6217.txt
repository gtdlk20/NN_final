I forced myself to get up and walk to my class. I passed the principle on the way and told him I wasn't feeling very well when he asked what was wrong. I lay down on the bench in the back of the room and tied to let myself relax a little. The only comforting thought that I had was that at least if something went seriously wrong I was in a safe environment, my school is my sanctuary, and no matter how fucked up I am I know my teachers and peers would take care of me. Anyways, it took about ten minutes for me to relax and chill out, and then I was fine.
