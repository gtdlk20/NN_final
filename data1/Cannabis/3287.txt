When I am high, I always become paranoid that Ive burnt some eyelashes or part of my eyebrow off, so I checked the mirror. I spent five whole minutes looking into it, and still couldnt decide whether Id singed anything or not. I then became distracted by just how red my eyes were. I saw the rivers of blood and their tributaries running over my eyes. I found this beautiful, and laid back in my bed and closed my eyes, smiling about it.
