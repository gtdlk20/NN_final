I asked my friend A if he was feeling anything, since it was his first time too.  He said not really.  I noticed when I talked to him that my voice seemed an octive lower than usual.  My mouth tasted/felt extremely sticky and dry; I needed a drink.  A wanted to stop by his brother's anyway so when we got there I got out with him so I could get some water.  On the way into his brother's I found I could barely walk straight. Things looked very strange.  My head felt like it was compressing a little and everything looked like it had no depth.  It looked kind of like a pop-up book, with each object being a card on a surface, not 3 dimensional like usual.
