Preparation: The day before, I had decided that I wanted to smoke the next day, so I got out my bag while my mom was out of the house, and began to crush up a couple of buds for a spliff. When I finished crushing up the large bud I figured I had enough for a little over 2 medium sized joints. For some reason I decided to combine two rolling papers so that I could fit all of the MJ into one big spliff, and once I had filled the papers with the weed there was still room left for more if I wanted. Well, I wanted, and so I started breaking up a smaller nug of weed from a different sack I got from another seller, which I considered to be pretty 'dank'. So after rolling this mammoth of a joint (at least 2.5 grams), which was rather difficult, I put it in a snack bag in my backpack for the next day.
