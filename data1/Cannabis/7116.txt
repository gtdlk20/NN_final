I got inside my house and went straight up stairs to my room.  By now I was wasted.  Thoughts were rushing through my head double overtime and were pretty much all paranoid. 'What if my mum knows?', 'Why would I go straight upstairs without greeting her?'.  I got upstairs and sat down at my computer.  Time no longer existed, it was just a false measurement of nothingness... The clock,  I couldn't wait till it stuck 6 ;whatever, the clock was the only comfort I had left.  I had to shut my curtains as the sun seemed too intense and the bright green leaves on the large chestnut tree shadowing my house were just far too bright.  Even this was a chore, it seemed to take ages just to walk a few steps.  I rested my head on the desk in front of me.  My left leg began to shake violently, I had no control over it.  My heart was pounding away like I had never experienced before, it was a crazy beast feriously battling to get out of the ribcage.  I feared I would have a heart attack, or maybe rupture an artery.  I began to pray to stay alive, and would have given anything to be sober again.  The side of my face seemed to be glued to the desk, I couldnt feel it anyway.
