The setting was a park, one which i had been to many times. So the experience began with all of us being like kids with candy, taking as much as we could, not knowing what we'd feel like afterward.  As we were smoking, i think about after the 5th hit, i finally started to notice something.  Sure enough, it was just the onsets, and i was happy that i was finally high and could now start to relate to people about what being high was about.
