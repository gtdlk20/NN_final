I needed water quick. Everytime I tried to say absolutley anything I would cough and my eyes got soooo watery it looked like I was baawling.  I was absolutley high as an airplane at this time. I was sitting still the whole time. Everytime I would slightly move, it was like I had just entered realitly again. And then wen I stopped moving, I was in a dream.
