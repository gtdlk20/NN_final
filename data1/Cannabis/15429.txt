It felt as if a veil was lifted off my mind, and I could see the universe as a whole, and see beauty in everything. I knew that the universe is one, bound together by music and love. I knew that I would always see the world from a slightly different perspective, perhaps a higher one. Since then I have seen order in chaos, and chaos in order. As a musician, I have changed dramatically. Overall, I feel a hightened awareness, and a greater connection with the universe, the earth, and mankind.
