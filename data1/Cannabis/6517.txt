Soon Matthew and Lukas arrived, and pulled out the weed while Mark felt it and estimated that the price probably should have been about 10 dollars cheaper. Then they packed the bubbler and started passing it around. Jessica decided not to smoke, but I did. I was the last in the circle of four that were smoking, and I managed one hit before the weed was kicked during the second time passing the bubbler around. They decided then to smoke a joint, and we sat there talking while Mark rolled the joint.
