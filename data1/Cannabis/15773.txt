Several weeks ago on a Thursday afternoon before sport at school my good friend and I decided that we should alter our state of mine ever so slightly through a complex ritual we like to call getting shit faced. I was not particularly in the mood to get stoned as I tend to become very uneasy when I am the only one stoned within a large group, and my friend and I both do different sports, so I decided to only have one lung full of mildly potent grass spun with some crushed rose petals (they do nothing to potent or change the experience in any way, my friend is just a bit strange).
