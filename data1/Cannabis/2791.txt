Now, I dont know if its my brain chemistry or whatnot, but I find myself to be much more susceptible to the effects of cannabis than the next guy.  Im constantly having people tell me theyve never seen somebody act as fucked up from weed as me, and every time, it seems more intense.  I will say that I believe myself to be considerably more creative than the average person.  I wouldnt say I was anti-social, but I tended to keep to myself when I didnt need to.
