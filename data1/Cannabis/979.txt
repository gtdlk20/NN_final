When I wake up again, it's maybe 2 or 3pm and I feel super- stoned.  No longer sick but completely non-functional.  I use the solar shower at camp, eat a power bar (it tastes disgusting and it's hard to swallow, but I know my body needs food), and feel like I am coming back to normal.  The nausea and dizziness are gone but for the next 24 hours I feel like I have an ecstasy hangover.
