He would take a hit and then shot-gun it to me, and then I would take a hit and breathe out like a dragon. We did this for an entire bowl and he asked me how I was doing. I was still feeling normal as usual. We slowly got up and as I was entering the room it blurred to the right and then to the left. The colors seemed beautiful although they seemed to bleed as the blur moved. I walk into the room and I tell him to wait up, I gaze at him a bit confused and then say 'No, never mind it's not happening anymore.' From that moment on my thoughts are just racing but everything seems so slow compared to all of the thoughts in my head. I start talking and it feels as if Im not the one doing the talking; it feels as if I were a mechanical doll just saying what I was programmed to say. This continues for awhile, I begin to walk around the room and just notice the difference in how things seem. My cheeks seemed heavy, my tongue seemed to swell up, the light outside was extremely vivid  then all of a sudden this burst of happiness just overcame me.
