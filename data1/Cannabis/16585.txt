My eyes were closed for much of the rest of the trip. All I remember is sensing the lights off the street lights, and the intensely painful feelings I was experiencing. I was shaking and panting, my heart pounding against my chest. I was jittering and had spasms too. I'm pretty sure it's a good thing I can't remember with much detail how it felt other than what I'm writing here.
