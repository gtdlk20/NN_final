I look at my hands--they really are huge. A giggle escapes, a dry, high sound. They don't look huge, perse, only feel huge. Like my nerves had stretched out about six inches from my body. I lean in to touch John's face and find that I can feel him without any physical contact. The sensation was like to touching your foot when it falls asleep--that feathery caress that leaves you in a dull, numb ache. But as soon as too much pressure is applied, the feeling goes away, leaving you unsatiated. When my hand lay against his cheek, the 'aura' left until I pull away. John announces to the group that I'm officially blasted. I say nothing--there's no need to.
