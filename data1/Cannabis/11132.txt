After this, just cook as normal following the boxÂ’s directions.  I was able to cut the tray into 12 potent brownies, slightly more than a half gram in each.  Worked well for everyone who had them, even very experienced smokers felt the effects for about 6 hours.  They tasted good too, just like normal brownies.  (Best eaten within a few days, I saved one and ate a little over a week later, it tasted terrible).  I personally felt them very strongly, my own experience follows.
