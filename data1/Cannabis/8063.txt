J. took her kids to A&W; and she brought me back a Mozzaburger at my request. I wasnt particularly hungry and chewing the burger felt very strange, but it tasted good (no better than it ever does, but certainly no worse) and I eventually finished it. An hour or two after the trip began, all jitteriness had subsided and I was feeling remarkable calm and sedated (far more than Im ever accustomed to feeling while sober). I sat outside for a while just watching people move about in the yard, feeling perfectly comfortable and content  the cold and wind didnt bother me (although I dont know if they would have anyway, neither was particularly strong).
