5:30 PM: S, H, and I get back to Cousin H's place and we go to the side yard where the table and chairs are. H talks to S about being a designated driver, what if she gets too high, what her parents will say, ect.. while I get out my little roach and tweezers and light it up. I take about 1 puff off it and it's already much too small for me to smoke anymore so I just put it in my pocket for me to unwrap and roll in another joint later. Well, S puts some eye drops in so I figure I should do the same and we're both smiling really big at each other as we do this. Cousin H goes back in the house to roll a joint, and as she comes out I was greeted with the most amazing looking hooter I had ever seen in my life! H lights it and takes a few puffs and then hands it to me, seeing as my parents know I smoke weed and are fine with it. I take 2 pretty good hits off it and wait a minute, and them a couple more and give it back to H and thank her graciously for being able to smoke that wonderful smelling, looking, tasting, joint.
