Then out of the blue, everything changed.  I enjoyed a few hits with some friends and went home to watch movies.  Within minutes I was overwhelmed with pure terror.  I spent a good hour on the phone with my mom bawling hysterically.  By the way, did I mention I was 30 at the time?  I'd smoked since I was 16.  I managed to conceal the fact I was stoned, just very upset.  That experience was enough to scare me away for a few months.
