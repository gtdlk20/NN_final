I got about 3 meters when I began to lose sight again and the ringing was getting louder. Finally realizing that I might not be able to make to to my porch in time before I fell yet again, I stopped and sat down on the curb 3 houses down from mine. I could feel my heart pumping at a very fast rate and I was sweating profusely. My breathing became very erattic and I was becoming very scared as I had no idea what was happening to me. I tried as best I could to take long deep breaths and tried to calm myself down in hopes I would feel better. It seemed like I was sitting there for 45 minutes when it could only have been around 15. Luckily, it seemed to work as the ringing subsided and the tunnel vision seemed to get better. Feeling slightly better I decided to go for it and walk to my porch and lay down on a bench. I got like maybe halfway and I could feel it all coming back, I kept going none the less determined to make it to the bench. Thankfully I made it before it got so bad as to where I couldn't walk, but just barely. I slumped on my bench and closed my eyes and continued my breathing technique which worked yet again after a few minutes. I then proceded inside where I quickly had something to eat and relaxed on my bed till all the symptoms faded away.
