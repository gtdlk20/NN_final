Everything just felt soo good to us as well.  We were always smiling, and I wanted to talk to everybody!  We were just so friendly to everybody and anybody!  It was like we were angels of happiness sent to spread happiness to everybody.  Our eyes were cashed of course and people noticed that but we didn't care at all.  We rode the elevator up to our rooms where we had a feast.  All we could do was drink and eat a lot of food!!  It wasn't hard to fall asleep either, I was watching a movie and fell right asleep at like 11pm, which is actually very early for me and her.  It was great.
