Here's some background before I narrate my first decent high. I live in University dorms. Many indulge in smoking pot and it's hard to get caught as long as the staff doesn't come to know. That being the case, I decided to try weed for the first time. My first time smoking cannabis by taking a few drags from a joint was disappointing, as the effects were minimal and very short lived. I didn't get quite high; what I experienced was shivering, a shaky, slow voice and laughter for half a minute. Later on, I felt disappointed. I wanted to get baked.
