Hughie has grabbed my hand. I wonder if he's as afraid as I am that I am going to die. He stroking it and telling me to stay with him. He's telling me that I am fine. That everything is going to be okay, and even though I am off in some far away place in my head I know he is lying to make me calm down. I'm tapping my heartbeat out with my finger tips on Hughie's hand. This makes him laugh. He recites a story about his brother and how he does the same thing when he's really stoned. I can't control the action, it's involuntary. I can feel myself starting to come back to reality as Hughie continues to talk. He is still holding my hand and as I begin to giggle at his story my heartbeat gets faster and I continue to tap it out on his hand.
