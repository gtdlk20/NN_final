Back inside I notice that if I shift my thoughts to something concrete, something mundane, the effect, the altered state, disappears! But only for a few seconds. As soon as I start to think or let my mind drift, the effect comes back in full glory! But it is good to know I can make it go away like that, even if just for a second. It is as if I can perceive my normal state and this altered state, and can switch between them.
