The next day my roomate, friend, and I drove up to the park to hotbox a blunt. It was a little rainy and we considered this to be perfect conditions for a hotbox. We parked at the end of the lot and rolled up the windows and began chiefing. All was going as planned except for a few cars that drove in and out but generally paid no attention to us. The whole time my friend was so paranoid that we had to constantly reassure him that we had never had trouble before and eventually got him calm enough to enjoy the hotbox. About halfway through the blunt a car parked in the lot behind us for about 5 minutes and left which we thought was suspicious but ignored it and continued smoking. We weren't facing the entrance to the lot but I could see everything in my rearview mirror. As the blunt was ending (probably half an inch long) my friend got a terrified look on his face and told me a highway trooper had pulled in the lot. I called bullshit thinking he was just trying to scare me but sure enough the trooper pulled up behind us.
