After about an hour or so, I was incredibly stoned. I had sort of a sleepy, dreamlike sensation going though my head, NOT ideal for something as physically demanding (or dangerous) as snow skiing. I remember the best part being leaving the slopes after only one poor outing on the beginner's slope and finding a restaurant where I restarted the day with coffee and breakfast. I met a couple on their honeymoon who were friendly and talkative. They had no idea I was zonked out of my mind and feeling like each sentence was only babble. Well, I got recharged and skied my heart out making the most out of a unique opportunity and after the success of this 'experiment' a friend and I each ate a much LARGER amount of hash on the plane ride TO Amsterdam later in the spring of '87!
