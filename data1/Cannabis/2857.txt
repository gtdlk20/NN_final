I saw many things in the mirror, they were extremely clear and I could see how they were composed of the actual elements that were reflected in the mirror, yet the closer I looked the faster they became other images. They ran a gamut from trains with gaping, fanged mouths, to the faces of old men whose mouths moved at the same time as mine, which were unconsciously muttering everything I was seeing trying to ground myself with M. I had a strong desire to melt into her, feeling that would save me from this strange phenomenon, but the design of the car would not permit it. When I looked away from the mirror I was disconcerted and felt like I had sunk to the bottom of a hole that was very hard to climb out of. I looked forward and the pattern of light on the tree branch in front of my car became a huge wolf with its mouth open lunging at the car. I knew these were hallucinations so the subject of them didn't actually produce fear in me, but the fact that I was having them did.
