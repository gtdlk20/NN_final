The visual component starts with things in my room looking like other things. Dunes on my computer screen (Egyptian themed wallpaper - a great 3D rendering) become faces, then diamond beings in spacechips (an unintentional pun I leave in, and proof that my subconscious engineering artist is a step ahead of my cognitive mind - they do look like space-chips. Anthropomorphic triangular cornchip spacecraft.) Then come the visions. They definitely contain the flavor of the cannabis quasi-CEVs I've come to know and love.
