After about 30 minutes I decided I'd had enough and that I wanted to go home. With great difficulty, I made it to a taxi but sounded surprisingly eloquent as I told the driver the directions to my house. As the taxi was moving forward, reality was moving forward with it. I was no longer falling down, I was moving forward, at an incredible speed. My heart was beating fast, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. It wasn't as bad as the falling feeling, but it was still somewhat frightening.
