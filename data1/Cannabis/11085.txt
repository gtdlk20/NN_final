It was getting late and I had to be home. So my boyfriend drove to his house where he and his friend would stay. I was afraid about driving home but I knew I had to. I didn't live too far but I still felt nervous. I kept thinking I saw cats in the road. Then it got to where I thought I saw babies. I was scaring myself pretty bad.
