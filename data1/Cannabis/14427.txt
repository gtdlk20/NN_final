Now, I don't know if it was something in the ganja, or if my lungs just reacted strangely, but when I was about ready to take another hit, I involuntarily inhaled VERY deeply. I was overcome instantly with a feeling of extreme disorientation and confusion. I put my bowl away and just sat there for a while. I ate my carrot and sipped the lemonade as I felt the first effects of cottonmouth coming on. I put Jimmy on and listened for a while.
