Obviously I needed to take drastic measures, so I trudged down the stairs and poured myself a glass of orange juice. My mother was downstairs, and I began to ask her a series of random, pandering, incomplete questions relating to how much food we had. She didnt catch on, thankfully, and I cut myself a small piece of cake. That didnt satisfy me, so I cut a piece twice as large and poured another glass of orange juice. I ended up eating 4 large pieces of cake and drinking 4 glasses of orange juice before I felt full enough to stop. It goes without saying that my headache had disappeared.
