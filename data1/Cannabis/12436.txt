After about ten minutes of doing that I realized where I was and that there is a trampoline outside. I ended up going out side to get on the trampoline, but all I remember is coming straight back in. I know I was out there jump on it because my back was wet because it had rained earlier. So I am wearing a wife-beater and I go to take it off because it is soaked. I take it off and put it down then sit there begging my friend to get me a shirt to wear so his mom doesn't come down and see me half naked, and would then know what was going on. After attempting to hit, raise my voice, and repeat myself he simply turns around reaches at the table and hands me that shirt that I took off a few hours ago so I could wear my wife-beater because it was too hot. I sit there fucking stunned, how the hell could I forget that I had a shirt right there behind me the whole time.
