The funny thing about this was that not only did the hip swiveling come from nowhere, but it was as if I could not control it. It seemed like invisible puppet strings were making me move and I could see it happening but couldn't stop it. I felt almost detached from my head...almost the feeling I would imagine the coyote feels when the roadrunner drops an anvil on him...stars.
