My first experience with cannabis was not entirely interesting, and for a while I viewed it very negatively, choosing to smoke only once in a great while and regretting it each time. I was of the opinion that it only made me irrational and dull. Once I got over this feeling I began smoking more often, but until this point I had never enjoyed the high as much as I did tonight. This may be a lengthy report.
