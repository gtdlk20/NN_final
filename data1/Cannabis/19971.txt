Within half an hour of smoking this joint we felt a very intense fog settle on us. As I can't speak for everyone else, I  remember the high to be very thick and cloudy. Tobacco (as we all smoked) seemed to have a strange taste like a bonfire and our munchies, Haribo and pizza, tasted very very weird. I recall that the Haribo left a thick coating on my tongue that tasted amazing for a very long time.
