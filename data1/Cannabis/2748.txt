And looking around, I suddenly realized my entire perception was palpable and existing, instead of just THERE and not so much existing tangibly than all that I knew. I could feel and remember how I've felt during my life, and could relive old experiences with vivid detail, now able to sense the dimension of perception, something we humans generally take so for granted that we don't even realize it exists. I began to consciously try to change my perception of my surroundings, and guided Elwin through this process as well. The leaves in the trees began to become more uniform, and the entire wilderness turned into glowing purple and green tessellations, interconnecting and phosphorescing right before our eyes. As we moved our eyes around the pattern followed, and then, I decided to add a dimension to it in my mind, and in a moment I was thrust into the center of a swirling green sphere of fractalized tessellations that swam around in a constantly moving sea of infinite complexity. And I knew that this sphere had an outside, and that I was just inside for a while, trying to pick up what I could while I was there. I felt, truly and palpably, that there was an afterlife... or better, an exolife.
