DidnÂ’t get much sleep that morning but when I woke up I felt like I had some sort of awakening! Only sort of similar to 1 or 2 other times in my life - (A SIMILAR HIGH/GOING UP THE SPINE -AFTER JUST SMOKING 1 BUCKET),, (IN SOME WAYS MORE INTENSE THAN SOME OF MY MESC/CACTUS TRIP BUT WITHOUT THE VISUALS).  Had to write it down.
