Everything that happened felt like a dream 5 minutes (or so it seemed) later.  We rode ALL of the rollercoasters and none of them scared me.  I was just like, 'Let's go for it.' Because I had no remembrance of it afterwards.  I saw a picture of me on one of the coasters and I was all 'zoned out' like I was just sitting at home like a lazy ass as usual.  I'm kind of upset that I got to miss the reality of the Amusement Park being that I don't get to go to them often.  But the feeling was great!  I had to literally hold on to Jamie because I wasn't aware of where I was, what I was doing, or where I was going.  The munchies hit me later though and I had to pay $20 in Hershey for a pizza!
