I don't smoke everyday but close to it, I know my limits and always smoke with moderations, preferring the ability to think and remember the night to getting completely fucked. I have done shrooms and hash on multiple other occasions but pot is my drug of choice, it really has made my life better and made me a more controlled and accepting person. I live in Vancouver city and growing pot is out largest industry in our province. It has been estimated that if the pot grown in BC was taxed that the profit would be upwards of two billion dollars. Almost a third of the people here smoke pot which really surprised me. Start watching for stoners and you might be surprised how many people smoke around you.
