All of the sudden I was falling, falling backwards into something, into some unknown universe or dimension. My head landed comfortably enough and as I looked up I realized the terrible mistake I had made. I had fallen right into Tak's lap. I know it sounds over dramatic saying it was a terrible mistake but Tak is scary. She's scary to anybody who fears for their own life and at that point I was afraid. Dib and Gir went completely silent as I looked up at Tak. It was as if time had stood still. It started quite harshly as Tak swatted me in the head and off her lap. We had a laugh as I apologized over and over again and then resumed chilling. Tak's mom entered the room shortly after and laughed at us all and called us stoners. That's all I really remember of that night.
