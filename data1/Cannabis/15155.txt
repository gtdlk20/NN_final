Me and a friend of mine (we'll call him Cornbread) were sitting around my house pondering the universal question: 'What the hell are we gonna do today?'  The answer was obvious, really: 'Smoke a phatty!!'  Well, we both had some weed at the time (his was about $80/quarter and mine about $50), so we decided to match up on a phat blunt.
