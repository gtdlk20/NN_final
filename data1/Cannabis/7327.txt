I remember the crickets were so loud in my ears I thought there were two inside my ears.  I was feeling so fucked but he still made me get up and grab my bike to come home.  When I got inside everyone was looking at me laughing like 'OH SHIT! HE LOOKS LIKE POWDER!  YOU OK MAN?!'  I could barely answer them so I just nodded and smiled.  I felt still that I could break out into a coughing fit if I had talked.  I told them all I was going to head out and thanked the brother for smoking me up.  He couldn't stop smiling and told me to bend down.  When I did he told me 'Dude, I knew you were last so I packed your hits more than I've ever packed hits before.'
