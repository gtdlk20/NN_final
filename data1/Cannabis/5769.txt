Eventually, I had to go. It was 6pm, and I wanted to get home, so I left for the bus, and durin the whole ride I was so relaxed, yet tired and sleepy the same time. My vision was still funny, and the dizzyness was still there, though. I'm pretty sure people noticed I was high, because when I stood up, I was all wobbly and whatnot. By the time I got home, which was at about 6:45pm, I ate like crazy, and noticed that movin gave me the biggest headache, and so I sat down. After a while, the headache went away, as well as the sleepyness, and so I sat there, waitin for my girlfriend to come home, so I could experience that one unique feelin that nothin else could ever mimic, love.
