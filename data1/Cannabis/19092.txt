However, not too long ago, me and a couple of friends packed a bowl with some really potent KB and after about three hits I was really tripping hard.  I was sitting in a car in a parking lot at night listening to trance music.  My eyelids were drooping and I could not move my body at all, not that I wanted to.  The music was enthralling--I could actually see it.  Everyone knows that smoking makes music better and I definitely appreciate it more when I am high, but seeing music is something else.  It was as if each facet of the music, and there were probably at least twenty--the bassline, the main melody, that strange clicking noise in the background, etc.--every noise took on a visual shape.  I could see every line of the music moving and dancing to its beat.  It was beautiful, absolutely breathtaking, until one of the shapes--a pink ball of light--began circling my head repeatedly.
