So that night we grabbed a pop can and fashioned a 'pipe'. She and I smoked about half of it and she was almost instantly messed up. I was pretty disappointed thinking I was immune or something. I distinctly remember her getting up off the bed and watching her stumble out the door mumbling about getting an apple. Next thing I remember was standing behind her at the fridge smiling. When I came to realize that I couldn't remember how I got there I told 'A' that something odd was happening. She just laughed at me and proclaimed that I was 'in the void!'.
