After realising how intense this high was going to be I decided to experiment with it. We all pretty much had the munchies, so I take two Redoxon out of the tube and hand one to Dingo. After his initial paranoia (I had difficulty explaining to him that it was safe to eat) I popped mine as well and immediately the sensation burned through my entire mouth. The effervescence of it, coupled with the sweet tangy taste was mind-blowing. I felt my teeth vibrating as the tablet dissolved, and started to giggle uncontrollably, Dingo was obviously feeling the same thing (I could tell by his facial expression) and started to laugh too. We both fell on the floor, giggling like idiots.
