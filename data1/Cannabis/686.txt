It was around about 5 minutes after my second trip that we got up and walked back into the college.  The heated sensation was slowly disappearing as I had other things to concentrate on, i.e. like desperately getting something to drink, and eat (we didn't have munchies as such, we just hadn't had lunch yet).  The college canteen is not a nice place to be when youre stoned, I have experienced large feelings of paranoia from there, because there's so many people, and also youre on college ground.  We ate there anyway, and my friend offered for us to go up into the Internet rooms, which I declined.  I was not expecting to 'trip' today, so I thought that going home would be my safest bet, so that if I did anything foolish it wouldn't be done in public.  So I walked down to the train station, where nothing major happened.  However when I got near the station I heard my train arriving, so I ran for it and got on it just in time.  I was not expecting this next trip... I think it was triggered by me running for the train: a large increase in heart activity, more oxygen in the blood stream etc.  It would be interesting to try that out again.
