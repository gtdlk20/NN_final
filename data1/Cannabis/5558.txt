3:30 AM- I have reached the peak and at this point my body feels like it has fallen asleep and is waking up slowly (the way an arm or leg would fall asleep).  It is a very, very strange sensation.  When I walk I feel like I am floating.  Closing my eyes reveals indescribable pictures, many of them containing animals and plants.  With eyes open, my eyes focus and unfocus constantly.  Light is very bright.  My posters on my walls creep slowly, as though they are running down the wall like fresh paint.  My eyes burn and they are more comfortable closed.  I turn on some dntel (ambient electronica) and lay down in my bed to relax in the dark.  I am experiencing slight ego loss.
