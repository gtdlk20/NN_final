I started smoking a lot of hash this year in college. I love the high it gives me. I went home for summer break and decided to eat the hash instead since the smoke leaves a smell to it and I didnt want my parents to know. Anyway, after numerous google searches on edibles I found a way to make one - in a mug. Its so quick and easy; 1 tsp of white flour, 1 and a half tsp of cocoa powder, 1 tsp sugar, mix that with a bit of milk to form a thick batter, add 1 tsp of vanilla essence to suppress the hash taste, take 1 tsp of oil, put some hash in it, don't need a lot, just the size of a pea, heat that until the hash melts in the oil completely. Mix it all together. Microwave for 1 min and a half - and voila.
