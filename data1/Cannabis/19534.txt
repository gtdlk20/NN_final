The movie started out very strongly, and as I lit up another bowl, I started singing along to some of the songs that I knew, although the remakes had rhythms I was not used to. It was perhaps twenty minutes into this movie that I started seeing it as the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, a feeling I still hold some months later. The utter perfection of the 'humanity' in the movie made me weep several times. By the end of the film, I had decided upon what I wanted to accomplish with much of my life. As a college student, I have been slightly indecisive about my major, where to go in life, and what to do. The character Jude, although fictitious, finalized ideas I had been having for some time. I knew I wanted to work on the wrongs of the world, and the best way I see is to start from the ground up; what people think. People think by what they know, and they know by what they are taught.
