It was a quiet, fall evening and I had just sneaked outside of my parents house to indulge in some of the dankest nug I had ever encountered.  The herb was covered in crystals and smelled skunkier than anything I had ever been around before.  Outside of the garage, I loaded my McGuiver-style Gatorade water-bong and began one of the most intense cannabis journeys of my life. It was about midnight, and a full moon hung in the sky; an omen of good times to come.  As I lit the bowl, the only thing that flared across my excited mind was that I hadn't been ripped for almost a month, and that this was probably going to be one of the most astounding trips I had even encountered.
