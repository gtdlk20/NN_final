I experienced my first moment of calm.  As the night wore on I would notice that my sense of hearing was, or at least seemed to be, extremely acute during these respites from the most vivid hallucinations.  I could clearly hear my heightened breathing through my nose.  But I was safe for now.  Bed.  If I could just crawl into bed and close my eyes I would be ok.  I looked to my right at my bed.  It was covered in a mound of clutter that normally would have taken me half a minute to clear, but in my present state it seemed like an insurmountable task.  I grabbed the first couple of things I could get my hands on  a pair of jeans and a shirt.  As I began to carry them towards my closet I remembered a conversation that I had had with a friend of mine about one of his acid trips  I had no idea what I was actually on but I certainly had my suspicions.  I remembered his story about playing the game Diablo before taking acid and then walking into his basement to the sight of people impaled on spikes throughout the room.
