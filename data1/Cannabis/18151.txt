I soon realized an hour or so had passed, and I was starting to come down.  I could not realize half of what had happened that I told myself to remember, because it was crazy, but my friend never showed up, and apparently I made some calls to another friend of mine flipping out...  This shit must have been laced, but hell, I don't care.
