8.14 - As my watch beeps the time, I struggle for exterior contact for no reason. I wish to call someone, and speak aloud, Damn, everyones at school. I crave salty food and inhale some more Triscuits, but then take a fearful swig of green tea. The life existing around me feels so beautiful, I wish to clad myself in clothes much in its colour and natural patterns, and go out into it where I can experience the beauty of music and love right in its deepest deaths. I feel as though the world has just thrust upon me the key to life in this marvelous cannabis experience and wishes me to emerge from the world relaxed and rejuvenated. I require a different musical selection now, and I restart my webcam.
