It all started when I bought a gram of some 'Sour Diesel Kush' from my friend A, after once or twice of smoking it out of his bong with him and chilling at his place. What's odd about this is that it was only when I brought the weed home and smoked it by myself (from an apple pipe!) that I had my mind truly blown. It was a normal Thursday night, and like usual I made two perpendicular incisions into a nice crisp green apple, and proceeded to pack the top/bowl with bud. For the past few weeks I had been smoking weed that was average at best, so I was surely about to have a different experience, if you will. I packed what I guess was a decent sized bowl of this Sour Diesel Kush, went out back and lit up. I coughed immediately from the smoke, which has to be easily the harshest I've ever inhaled. I had to take a few moments to recover and take the second hit. I think I took two or so more nice hits before the bowl was either cashed or the weed had shrunk down into the center of the apple, rendering it almost unreachable by flame without practically burning my throat.
