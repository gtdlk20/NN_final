I felt the effects of the chocolate within 45 minutes and by T+ one hour was experiencing visuals. They were not dynamic in the way that they are during the peak of an LSD trip (warping, breathing, rippling etc), but they were still very pronounced in terms of colour, contrast and shading.  Leaves for examples seemed to blend into textures and forms that drew upon the original but were far richer and more complex with colours and shade transforming from greens into golds and silvers. Depth perception was also altered with a mixture of flattening and deepening. It remained possible to come back to normality by focusing hard, but as soon as I relaxed, the visuals would come back. The peak experience lasted for perhaps one and a half to two hours.
