But of course, though there is an 'in' crowd here, I am failing at life by turning myself and Ani into 'us' and everyone else into 'them.' God, but this is awkward, and psychedelic drugs would really help me deal with that. I would perceive the oneness that suffuses all life, it would render these aggressive and combative tendencies in others laughable in the face of the unity that permeates all things. It seems attractive to take something. It also seems too easy.
