I had been smoking pot for about 3 or 4 months, and until then, I had never hit from a gravity bong. I'm a recovering Bulimic, so I weigh very very little. So this was good shit, it was headies. I take a monster hit off of the gravity bong, and I didn't exhale all of it. So I start coughing, a lot. I start to get dizzy from lack of oxygen. At this time I started thinking I was blacking out, but in reality I was just blinking. I start freaking out majorly, thinking I'm going to die. My friends, and the guy who bought the pot for me, help me onto a mattress, and things become very weird.
