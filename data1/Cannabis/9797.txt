I woke up at 1am in a bed somewhere in some dark room. I panicked and looked around and saw Josh sleeping next to me. I woke him up and asked him what happened. He said that a friend had found me passed out and brought me up to a bedroom to sleep. He promised me we hadn't had sex or anything. The party was still going on downstairs. He called a cab to bring us home and after a short ride back to my house, I said goodbye to Josh and dragged myself into my room.
