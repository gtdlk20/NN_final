Everything moved in flash frames, no longer continuous. I was a bit disoriented and so was my sister. We bumped into each other several times. We made our way to the kitchen and drank some water, our mouths were bone dry. I could feel paranoia setting in, but I was determined not to have a bad trip so I put my demented thoughts in the back of my mind. We decided to watch TV. I couldn't keep still, the numbing of my body drove me nuts. My thoughts went everywhere except the movie we were trying to watch. One moment seemed unconnected to the next. What was going on?
