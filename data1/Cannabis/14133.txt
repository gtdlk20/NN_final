When we got to the mall, me and Matt's friend, still slightly stoned, talked about 'shrooms and how great they are. After a while at the mall, we went back to Matt's house. Matt's house has a lot of history, we always got stoned there, it was the best place to go. Now, I felt very comfortable around both Matt and his friend, being able to have a good back and forth conversation with both of them. I felt connected, I finally felt like I belonged after losing my best friend.
