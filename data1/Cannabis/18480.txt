If only I was rolling, my ability to drink massive quantities of water and not urinate would have been intact. I then stepped outside and sat next to Spin (For lack of anything better to call him, merely the first part of where he works) and started talking to him. He took was on one of the pills we took, but like the rest, wasn't feeling anything. I smoked a few bowls with him and talked a bit before going back inside. After Sicily went back outside I claimed a spot on the couch next to Fuck-Up and began talking. Fuck-Up was waiting to roll the next day with some others in a big city, but after she saw how everyone else faired, she was thinking about not doing it. Monster on the other hand....he was pretty fucked up from the shrooms he ate. We sat around watching VH1-Classic while all manners of friends came and went outside. We had a small conversation about what we dubbed the 'bunk ass pills.' We had two tips and six people attempting to roll.
