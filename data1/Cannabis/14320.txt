I rolled two 1.5 gram joints and put a small amount (perhaps .2g) of this oil in only of of the two joints.  Then two friends and I compared the effects of these two joints.  The hash-laced joint was clearly much stronger to all three of us-- a much more uplifting, heady high and no 'couch lock' effect.  The comedown took longer than with the unlaced joint as well.
