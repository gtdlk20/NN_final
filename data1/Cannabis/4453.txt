I began texting a few friends of mine who were experienced potheads. I asked them what to do. They responded to feed the high, or eat food and drink liquids in order to expedite the disintegration of the high. I guess it worked; Im not for sure though. I had begun to eat a TV meal, drink multiple cups of tea and water, and eat random stuff from the fridge.
