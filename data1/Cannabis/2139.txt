They say marijuana reduces concentration.  This makes me smirk in contempt because even though, yes, it can cause one to not be able to focus on the two-dimensional shit of our everyday lives?  Sure weed makes me lose focus on that shit, but only because Ive moved on to another world in which all things that seemed important now are trivial in the context of this vast other universe (universe isnt even big enough a word.  Dimension, if that werent so overused..ahh) So Im in another dimension.  Thats why I cant focus on stuff from the lower place.  Because Ive been temporarily raised to the view of god.  This makes me very vulnerable. I feel vulnerable (fearing fear itself a lot) when I smoke weed.  But thats just because Ive stripped away myself and zipped into, it seems, a large tent in another dimension.  This is rather unfamiliar and scary each time it happens.  But wow, these words are really two-dimensional.  Or, in my state, one-dimensional.  Its difficult to describe normal life in words.  This is in another dimensional shit.
