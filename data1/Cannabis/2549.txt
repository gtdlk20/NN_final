Soon enough a guy appeared out of what seemed to be nowhere, he was demanding that everyone take a bite out of the gigantic sub-sandwhich that he had purchased. I opened my mouth and he shoved the sandwhich in my mouth, I immediately realized that there was something in the sandwhich that I didn't like, pickles and onions. These two things made me very sick, very quickly. I pretended like I needed to take a crap, and attempted to go in my friend's bathroom, where I found it was being occupied by someone else, so I went to the private bathroom, my best friend's (person who lived at this house) mom's bathroom. Where I knew no one was allowed to go, so I would be safe to throw up and no one would walk in and find out.
