I watched some more videos on my phone (maybe porn? i don't remember) Then I checked the clock and it was only a few minutes later. This is when I realized time was moving very very slowly. At this point I was super annoyed, and wondered why anyone would voluntarily get into this state. I had some thoughts about how ironic it would be to have bought several hundred bucks worth of cannabis products only to toss it after getting too high once. I really just wanted it to stop, but knew there was nothing I could do but wait.
