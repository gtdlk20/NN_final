8.39 - I am amazed that Ive only been high for 40 minutes, it feels as though it was an eternity, considering the movement of the sun over the earth has been dramatic, and my mood has changed so deeply. I am really stoned now, and am experiencing a euphoric full-body buzz, as so many of us have heard described. I consider going out for Chinese food, as fried rice with little pieces of meat sounds amazing. Maybe I will order it, they couldnt be too upset, eh? Maybe some spare ribs too. Oh, shit, no delivery. Damn, I wish they delivered everything. Or they had like a totally automated method for delivering all food, where like everything would be kept in giant metal containers or something. Wow, I just had a total out-of-body experience, I feel content and happy with everything the world has to offer, and am thrilled with the thought of my article being enjoyed worldwide.
