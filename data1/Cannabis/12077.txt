Well, I walked down the street, made a left, then another left and walked back the other way. This is when it started to get good, I was looking at the shadows that the bushes were leaving. I could see all sorts of things in the shadows and the bushes themselves. I walked some more and by now I was on the same street  that I started on, but on the other side. I walked down some big boulders and sat down. I looked out across the construction site and saw this flat field, and I can see the star light covering an area that I decided was about the shape and size of a football field. Then I looked to the left of it and I saw what I decided were Aztec Ruins. Then there was this statue in front of it, and I it was 'beckoning' me to enter, but I told myself, 'never trust a statue, they are sneaky.' Then I saw what appeared to be a 'two-story dump-truck' coming down this hill, and I freaked out and scrambled up the rocks like 'Spider Man' but then I realised that I left my CD player at the bottom, so I ran back down, and the truck was gone.
