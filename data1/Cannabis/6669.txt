The strongest part of this trip came on and began to frighten me. I didn't know what was going on and thought that death was now inevitable if I couldn't return to my body so I was desperately trying to catch up to it but felt as though my movements were faster than the speed of light at the same time. I fell against a wall and held onto the folded parts of my beanie, pulling on it and holding it securely on my skull. The movie file began to get more intense. Things were popping out at me, sounds threatened my safety, eyes stared, mouths laughed, and ears closed to me.
