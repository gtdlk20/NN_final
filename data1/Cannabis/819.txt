2:30. I turn off the lamp, turn my computer screen toward my bed, switch on the Winamp visualizer, and lie in bed to watch and listen. I'm using Jet, but later I switch to G-force. Both seem to be very popular eye-candy for stoners. The patterns look awesome. The textures seem richer. The colored seem purer - more vivid - delicious - almost edible! I feel like I'm David Bowman at the end of 2001 - Jupiter and beyond. A very cosmic motif. I should've put on some Ligeti. Also, the artificial synesthetic properties seem to be enhanced - I notice the relationship of the patterns to the music much more than I used to. I spend the next half hour in an open-eyed trance as a floating consciousness in a small dark room, listening to my shuffling Winamp playlist on a good pair of headphones and watching the visualizer with renewed appreciation. I seem to possess a profound insight into the lyrics of every song I hear. I feel I've gained a deep understanding of Terence McKenna's timewave theory. I write: 'Novelty must be conserved and accelerated or existence would be a logical fallacy.'
