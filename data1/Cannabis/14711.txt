As I was trying to figure out what had caused my bliss just a few minutes ago, I started to take greater notice of the lush green trees outside. Then just as suddenly a wondrous feeling came over me. This was many times more profound than before and it lasted for most of the 15-minute bus ride. During this time I lost my entire internal monologue, apart from the occasional ?wow? and ?what?s going on.? My mind was empty of verbal thought, instead filled with raw emotion, a type of bliss or ?nirvana,? if you will, so profusely mind-blowing that it brought tears to my eyes.
