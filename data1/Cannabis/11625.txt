As I had a thin layer of sweat covering my body, I grabbed a cold Mountain Dew and cranked the central air. I then sat down here at about 4:45 to start writing this. I am most assuredly still under the influence of all three drugs ingested (one being the amitriptyline which doesn't seem to affect me in the 'fun' way anymore). I think if anything the CNS depressant effects enhanced the MDMA high and they combined for a great experience.
