These thoughts and more race threw my head, then I have a realization that almost made me swear off marijuana forever. What if I stay this way forever? I can only think of my family standing around me, watching me freak out. I start to think Im a waste of skin, useless, a disgrace. But suddenly something in my head snaps me back to reality; I realize that its just the weed. I think back to all the time before this, when I felt too stoned and I always got through it and in a couple days at the most I would be back to normal. These thoughts comforted me enough that I was able to get to sleep yet again.
