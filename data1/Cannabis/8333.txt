I knew we had smoked ourselves into oblivion once we were all rolling around on the floor mumbling to ourselves.  It was about 2am when we all drifted off to slumber land.  When I woke around 10am, I felt like I had just completed a whole lifetime of movement in a single night.  I just laid on the floor, lit a morning bowl, and reflected on my life as the sunlight streamed through the windows onto the floor.
