I dont know why but I started to feel guilty about smoking the weed and began to get very very paranoid. I thought at any moment my heart was going to explode and I was going to die. I tried to think about something else but it didnt work. I would start feeling guilty and paranoid again. It seemed like hours had gone by and I began to think that it would soon go away but when I looked at my watch, only 5 minutes had passed by!
