As the night progressed i started on the exploration of my inner self, learning about things which i had experienced, and who i was.  Putting together thoughts, and travelling on the brain waves of thought to understand how things are connected.  As i dug myself deeper and deeper into my mind i slowly noticed paranoia creeping up on me.  I was alarmed with many things and proceeded to act somewhat like a cat, quick and very attentive.  My friends thought this was all funny and just couldn't get enough of it.
