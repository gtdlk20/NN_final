For the next 30 minutes or so I kept going in and out with I guess I would call a blackout. But to me it felt more like overlapping time. I still can't remember the moments lost, but I vividly remember when I came to and freaked out to 'A'. She was giggly and enjoying peeling and eating her apple while I was shaking and discovering a blanket wrapped around me out of nowhere and sitting at the counter.
