My friend was not at all opposed to the idea, as he also gets along well with my dad but unfortunately that time he was between harvests and we were currently out of smoke.  We didn't get to smoke that time, but the next time he was up was after the final harvest so when I told my dad how much bud my friend had he expressed some interest in buying from him.  He bought a 1/4oz and the three of us got high that entire day until the rest of the circle got off work and they all joined us for the rest of the evening.
