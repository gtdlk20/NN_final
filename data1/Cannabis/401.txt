Thank god for two things: 1) Jim is a very calm, levelheaded guy 2) He is a bit of a psychonaut.  He started talking to me in his normal, calm voice, which was immensely comforting to me because it sounded nothing like what I had been hearing inside my head.  I realized that even my own internal monologue had been at screaming intensity in order to be heard over the klaxon sound.  Jims voice was mercifully quiet.  I told him I thought that I was through the most intense part of it.  He laughed a little bit.  Im not so sure about that one.  He continued to talk for a while relating part of his most recent acid trip.  Then he got up and said he was going to go ask exactly what it was I had smoked.  I nodded, not really realizing that I was letting my link with reality walk out the door.  The inside of the room was still dark so I turned around again to stare at the light of the hallway through the open door.  The contrast between light and dark was just too much.  As I watched, the shape of the door began to warp from a rectangle into a parallelogram.  My eyes looked to the left again and the scene snapped back to normal.  This time it was even more jarring and really not worth it.  As I watched the door began to warp again.  The hallucination would not be denied.  This was all just too much for my equilibrium.  I became aware of a strong sense of nausea.  Time to make for the bathroom.  I had resisted the urge until now.  I didnt know what my mind would make of the toilets mini-whirlpool.  Rational thoughts like that would occasionally interject themselves during calm moments of the experience.  I dont think they really helped me do anything other than anticipate the next descent away from rational thought.
