The problems all started after 1 summer, when I was smoking this one strain of bud that I got off the same person I used to always get, when it started giving me anxiety, things just didn't feel right anymore and I was getting 'sketchy type' highs. I didn't even feel relaxed at all. I started having a few episodes where I would go into a case of extreme panic just off of a few hits, and my heart felt like it was going to explode and I couldn't seem to control it, I couldn't even stand still. I would have to powerwalk, or keep moving, no matter how hard I tryed to relax. Even with different strains, from different people, same thing would happen. I sort of cut back a lot on smoking cannabis, and only did it occasionally, but it was really hard considering that so many people smoke it now recreationally. Just about all of my friends were pot heads too.
