Later down the trail we hit some LONG grass which was really bugging us because it felt like bugs on our legs, but my friend says, 'man, we cant feel this, our legs are covered in foam'. . .and that instant the irritation dispeared, it was great. A few feet more and we found ourselves in one of those old Mario games for nintendo, picturing it seemed so real, like I was really in it. . .
