I sat down on the carpet in my room and slowly lit up a bowl packed with a fairly good sized bud (I had broken up and de-seeded the nugs mind you). I inhaled deeply and held it in. I repeated this twice more, making for 3 fully smoked bowls (with each piece as big as the thimble-sized bowl would hold and smoked until it was mostly black ash).
