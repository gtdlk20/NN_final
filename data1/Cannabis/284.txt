If there were one thing I think I should state here, that would have heavy influence on my (or anyone elseÂ’s) experiences with any drug, is that I have an immense respect for all psychoactive substances. I'm not the most experienced tripper out there by any means, but I take comfort in the sense of wonder I get when I think about the things I've already learned, and have yet to learn down the road-I've found that more times than not, that light of wonder and love of life can take one farther than simply using the drugs.
