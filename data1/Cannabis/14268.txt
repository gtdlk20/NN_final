We sat down outside of the store to just chill while we ate. I felt pretty good at this point, but there was this feeling of anxiety. I would watch the cars drive by and criticize the shitty ones and point out the ones I thought would be nice to drive for the day. Then as each car drove by, it started to get annoying to look at them and everything was bright. When the cars drove by they seemed to move slower than usual. They were all 2-D, like I couldn't see all the dimensions of the car and I couldn't tell where the corners of the car were.
