As he walked off I asked him for another cigarette incase I wanted one, and out of generosity he gave me the rest of the pack. Granted it was only three, that's still real fucking nice. He also ensured me that if I ever wanted any more that I could ask him and have as many as I liked. I'm no a big smoker, but that's just damn nice of him. So, there I was, on a trampoline, out of my mind, with a notepad and minimal light.
