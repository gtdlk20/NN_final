During this time I noticed a lot of things that I don't normally pay much attention to, in a serious way. Every single movement of my fingers was palpable, and the vibrations my vocal chords made were so amazingly easy to feel and control that I began to sing, truly feeling as if every note I made was perfect, for my senses were so enhanced musically. As I walked back I found it hard to walk regularly and easily, for the world danced with my footsteps, and with the outer perspective that I had gotten, it took much more concentration to walk normally and act normally, for my mind was much too busy dancing around the gigantic universe it had just discovered. When I got back to the dorm, I found I could type much better, for with my eyes closed I could see a perfect map of the keyboard and how my brain drew the correspondances between finger location and letter typed, and could also spell out long words clearly and quickly in my mind. I put on a pair of headphones and I thought I was listening to some music for a while, but several minutes later I realized I had never started any music in Winamp, and all of the music had been in my imagination, though to my brain it was by then just a vague auditory memory. I thought of Carrie, and was instantly (and still remain) entranced by our excellent night together, and truly felt connected to her and everyone else in a way that seemed very childlike and wonderful... another recalling back to a level of perception I think I definitely had when I was younger and have since forgotten.
