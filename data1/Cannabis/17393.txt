6:00 PM: There are a lot of people here and I am tired so I sit back at the table where everyone is congrigated. S suggests that we leave because I'm acting really weird, so we do. I wanted to be with the people and possibly tell them how good I feel so that they can feel the same pleasure, but I didn't have the chance to. Oh well.
