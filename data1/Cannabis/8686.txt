I first smoked weed as a sophomore in high school. I felt nothing the first time. Fast foward to this year. I recently got a friend to hook me up with a twenty sack. I had no idea how much this really was, and it wasn't until I was twenty dollars lighter and at home with my ziplock baggie that I could examine it.
