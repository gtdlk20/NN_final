My boyfriend, S, rolled me a joint containing about half a gram. He had his own to smoke. We left my house to take a walk around the neighbourhood while we smoked them. At about halfway through the walk, things shifted from hazy to surreal. It felt strange to move my legs; as if my strides were exceedingly short. My surroundings seemed somehow foreign. Eventually, I decided I was too high to continue smoking my joint to myself and I shared the last bit of mine. Upon arrival back at my house, I noticed that my sight seemed to be clearer: when I leaned in to kiss my boyfriend, I saw a sort of sharpening of detail, as with MDMA. In addition to this, colours seemed brighter and his eyes seemed to grow larger.
