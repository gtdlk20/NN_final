When I was in middle school only a select few students were known drug users, none of which I was friends with. The possibility of me getting weed was not feasible. After reading online about nutmeg, I decided to give it a go. I now regret this immensely and blame it for a large portion of my paranoia. This first time I megged it was a beautiful experience. I had taken it the night before at around 9pm and woke up the next morning in a dream like state. It was beautiful. I went to school the same day and was constantly forgetting things. I asked a kid in my science class what time we had math. He looked at me with a puzzled expression and said, what? We just had math last period. I still didnt remember but agreed with him and replied oh yeah, wow Im dumb.
