9:20pm: I begin to have memory lapses. I begin moving my head, neck, and arms over and over again in the same motions until I catch myself and realize what Im doing. Im zoning out into a deep, bottomless train of thought. I want to stop thinking and I do manage to clear my head for a couple seconds at a time. However, the thoughts race back again at lightning speed. I was thinking in a cycle about going crazy, reassuring myself that nobody goes crazy from smoking weed, completely forgetting what was going on, and then remembering what was going on and preparing myself for this thought loop over and over again like a cycle. Only each time I got to the next part of the cycle it felt like the first time.  I begin to fear permanent brain damage. I remember that during the first part of this cycle or thought loop my mind was stuck in, I did not realize what was wrong with my thoughts (which caused me to panic). During the middle of the thought loop I would realize that I was either thinking too fast or too slow, (which caused me to panic further), I wasnt able to figure out which was true (if my thoughts were moving too FAST? or too SLOW?) and this frightened me even more.I would then realize that the solution to this problem would be to stop worrying about the fact that I was thinking either to fast or too slow, only to zone off into my thoughts inexplicably and uncontrollably, and enter this thought loop all over again. My friends and I leave the backyard and begin walking around the streets.
