I decided I didn't want to smoke it in the pub, so I put it in my tin and we all went back up to the hill where we usually hang out. When we arrived, I pulled out my blunt and sparked it up. I took my piece and then passed it round to my friends. Immediately I felt a warm sensation flood my body, and I started to feel far more relaxed and I started to be more talkative and less shy.
