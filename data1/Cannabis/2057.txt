The next day, I felt very relaxed, and had slept in well. I recalled what I could of the previous night, and was a little astounded. I hadnt expected such a glowing experience from half a joint of cannabis. It didn't seem like the experience was something forced by the cannabis, but rather, something it facilitated. Experiences afterwards would vary as they became more numerous, but for a first real experience, I was more than content. Deciding the image of the phosphorescent worms was the gem Id bring back from the experience, I penned a two line poem describing it, which has turned out to be one of my favorite verses in my notebook.
