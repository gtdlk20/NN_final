I was up in Missoula Montana for thanksgiving at a friends house. It was an interesting trip. Nevertheless, one party at the house made it all the more interesting. People started smoking pot and on impulse, I figured I would try a bit of it. Thinking that I didnt want that much of a reaction, I only had a few hits off the bubbler. Afterwards I nearly hacked up a lung because of my sensitivity to smoke. Everyone else around me started to feel the effects while I didnt really feel anything.
