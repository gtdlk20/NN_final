I am a college student who smokes marijuana every day. And I don't mean I have a bowl every night, I mean I smoke a lot of chronic often. My tolerance is without question extremely high. That said, last night I took a hit of hash through a hash piece. It was a good 7 second hit of incredible hash. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I had to immediately sit down I was so wrecked.
