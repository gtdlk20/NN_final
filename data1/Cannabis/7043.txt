The lamp on the end table to my left, as well as the standing lamp on the other side of the room, as far as the little b.b.Â’s of light are concerned, seemed to function as magnets or  attractants, as the little bullets of light would accelerate, squiggling towards and appearing to bounce off the lamp shades.  It was as if the room were on fire with hundreds of whitish yellow glowing streaks of light, all in time with the song playing on the stereo.
