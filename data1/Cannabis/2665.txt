8.04 - I am still going up, believably. When I close my eyes, I can view coloured graph-generated lines forming pictures of what I can see in my mind. I seem to type by predicting giant mathematical patterns in my mind outlined by these wires. This sensation cannot be grasped by anyone who has never used marijuana. I just feel happy and content, yet massively hungry and thirsty. I also feel satisfied with myself for the labour required to purchase this bowl. And I just completed my inhalation of the first bowl of chips. The world around me seems fascinatingly dynamic, and I am filled with an urge to rush out and behold of its beauty, but I must hold fast. I will return, with a plant from it to satisfy me. Oh, and food.
