I realized that earlier I had to go to the bathroom but forgot about it. Now I just acted purely on instinct and went to go take a piss. I pissed for like a minute straight but felt no bladder pain or anything which really scared me. I thought I might just not realized it and hold it in until it burst. Then for about an hour I just sat there and visualized a whole bunch of shit which seemed so real to me at the time. I ended up falling asleep at like 4 o'clock and waking up the next morning still fucking high. Not anywhere near what I felt that night before but I defiantly could tell there was some weed affecting me still.
