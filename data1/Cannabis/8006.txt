I sat down by the fire and was immidiately enveloped by it.  It sent the most wonderful warm vibrations through my bodyI felt the warmth like Id felt nothing before.  It was almost like an constant orgasm.  I started talking to Fred, and it was pretty obvious that he was higher than a kite.  After fighting the giggles for a while, I managed to stand up and go get my bag of licorice.  I promptly ate the whole bag.  We talked, we laughed, we even talked about laughing.  Ann and Kate even joined in on our laughing, even though they werent high and didnt know we were high.  We sat around the fire for hours, at least until about 1 or 2 am.  I was reluctant to leave the fire, but eventually did and went to my tent.  After curling up in a sleeping bag, I began to think about all sorts of thingsreally weird things.  I tried to comprehend shit like how big the universe is and how no two people are alike.  It blew my mind.  I was still going really strong, which made it hard to sleep. I actually learned something very important while I was drifting off to sleep: human beings are lonely creatures.  If you think about it, life is nothing more than a continuous series of interactions with other people.  This is all we have in this world, so make sure you make the most out of it.  Be positive towards others, and you can probably find peace with yourself.
