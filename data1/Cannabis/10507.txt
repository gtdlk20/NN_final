I could barely hold my head up anymore so I let it fall back against the top of the seat.  As I looked up at the ceiling, I saw waves across the browness of the ceiling.  I was shocked.  Then, I looked outside, and for a second everything seemed normal.  Soon though, I realized that everything was underwater, and trees were tying themselves in knots.
