I've got to say that that night was one of my best smoking experiences of all time.  My dad bought us all beverages, pizza, took us out for dinner for munchies (he's kinda loaded now).  He regaled us with stories from back in the day when you could score a lid (I had to ask him what a lid was, it's a full ounce) for $5 and if you spent $20 you got some super dank ass weed.  He made some awesome prank calls with me.  He started trying to fuck with our heads when we were really feeling it by talking in this gibberish and acting like it was a real conversation.  And every once in a while, I would look at him and think, 'My God.  He's been living for so much longer than I have, and yet here we are connecting in this complete and wonderful manner in a way we never have before.  This is so fucked up!  I'm blazing with my fucking dad!'
