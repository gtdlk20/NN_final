BIG MISTAKE.  When I turned on the shower the most complex musical score you could ever imagine accompanied the falling water.  My life was a fucking sound-track.  Everything I did blended into the music of the shower.  When I dropped the soap it's thud on the tiled floor became a dramatic crash in the classical overture that only I could hear.  I began feeling as if I would never be ok and I wanted the music to stop so that I could 'attempt' to study.  I leaned my head against the wall and closed my eyes.  I just kept thinking of how fucked up I was.  The music wouldn't stop.  I knew that I was tripping because I never had a high like this before, this was more extreme than any high ever.  I always hear sounds when I'm high and sometimes they sound like music, but not like this.  This music was so complex and sounded as if it could rival Beethoven's Fifth.
