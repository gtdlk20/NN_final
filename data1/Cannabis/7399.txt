The song changes to Pink Floyd - Time (Winamp playlists are wonderful things) and strangely, so do my 'visuals'. This time the sea is red, then cycles through blues, greens, purples and yellows until I'm confronted with a myrian of dancing bears, in jester's hats. At this point I open my eyes and blurt out something about teddy bears and banannas and start to move to the music. As I close my eyes I envision my arms as great feathered wings. Dingo, on ther other hand, is pretty stoned, but in a different manner altogether. He'continuously talking about everything and nothing, all in a hilarious New York accent. Nos just sits and laughs at us, and tries to get into the fun.
