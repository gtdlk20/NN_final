My cousin, Dru, and I had been planning a smoke session for about 5 or 6 months before I finally went with a few friends to meet him.  We met and me and my friend went with Dru out into the woods of Michigan State to smoke a joint and a bowl or two.  I had smoked a few times before but never had a real high; the last time I smoked was 3 months prior.  As we arrived at the designated spot in the forest, Dru took out his joint of average weed and lit it.  I could take hits fairly well so I took advantage of that.  My first hit sent me coughing so that I couldnt participate in the next round.  I finished off the joint in my next hit and we took out the bowl.  I took 2 more hits off of that and it was cashed.  Dru had more weed but we all decided that we had had enough.  As we were walking back, I wasnt feeling very high except I was hallucinating small things, mostly thinking that certain shadows had depth and could have been small animals.
