42 minutes: I can't see anything. I'm not exaggerating. I see shapes, I see lights, that's it. My stomach feels like it flips upside down. I feel the need to throw up. The bathroom is nearby, so I suck it up, and get there. I still can't see shit.I sit on the toilet to try and feel better, no luck. I try to make myself puke, nothing. I am rendered completely motionless on the bathroom floor.I can't move any part of my body without feeling extreme pain (note that I only briefly lifted weights, that was my only activity in the past 30 minutes and it was not intense).
