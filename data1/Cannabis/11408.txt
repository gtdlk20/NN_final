My friend made it inside with apparent ease, giving me hope for myself. I put my hands on the base of the window and used what little strength I had in my wobbly arms to pull myself in. I ended up scraping a few layers of skin off my thumb, which seemed to bleed forever. Damn window. My friend then got on his computer and was lost to Counterstrike, so I needed to entertain myself. What better way to entertain myself than to play the original Super Mario Bros.
