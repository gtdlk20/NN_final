It is now getting light inside the tent.  I try to sit up but am so dizzy that this is literally impossible.  I feel very sick and nauseated.  I'm going to throw up but I can't move.  I have to pee but I can't move.  It's at least 6am because the sun's coming up.  I am tripping and sick and delirious and semi-paralyzed.  Passing thoughts of brain damage and seizures float around in my head, but I'm too sick to care.  I tell my partner I feel very sick.  He finds a first-aid person from the festival who helps me out of the tent so I can crawl into the bushes to pee.  I tell her I had some cannabis tincture last night and she does not seem concerned.  She helps me pee and get back to my tent.  Reminds me to drink water.  Gives me some Benadryl which I don't take.  I am too sick to feel embarrassed.  I throw up into the grass.  I feel a little better and crawl back into the tent to try and sleep.
