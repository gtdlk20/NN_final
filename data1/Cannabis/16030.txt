We went inside his house and I remembered smoking now and I watched him play video games, but I couldn't pay attention I would keep on dozing off and look at random things and become entertained by them. This wasn't even the peak. My friend had to leave so I walked home. I only live like 2 streets away. On my way home I saw the mailman. I got really paranoid I kept saying to myself he knows I'm high he knows I'm high.
