I was hanging out with my step-brother and a female friend of his. We drove quite a way to get it from a friend of hers. We went back to my brother's place to smoke it. She made a home-made bong out of a 2 litre pop bottle. My brother rolled two joints, one for me to and one to share with them. I paid for the 2 grams, so they were very liberal with giving it to me. They also thought it was great that it was only my second time. They are both chronic users.
