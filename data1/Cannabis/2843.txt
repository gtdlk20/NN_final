I've noticed that sometimes people (including me) have a significantly different type of experience than just being stoned after smoking pot. It seems to occur either soon after use of a heavier psychedelic such as psilocybin or LSD or after abstaining from the habit for a while and then returning. It is unrelated to the amount smoked... it can happen from one or two hits.
