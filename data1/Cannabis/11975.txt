Last night however, I had gone out to meet a friend and smoke a J before going to bed. This was a typical habit as I had been meeting up with him and smoking several times a week now. He had already rolled the weed (about a gram I'd say) and we began smoking it in the cold, outside an old school. Everything seemed normal, and I had smoked about 1/2 the joint, which was usual. I felt disappointed at first as my friend was clearly feeling the effects, while I hadn't been hit with any of the high. I guess my first mistake was underestimating this feeling. I took a few more hard tokes and decided that I just wasn't in any condition to feel the high (this sometimes happens to me, I just plain don't get high even off of good weed and a good amount). My second mistake was probably my decision to smoke at all that night. I had been nursing a bad hangover all day as well as feeling the after effects of some hash smoked the night before as well as some seriously laced weed. My body had been weak and my stomach and head felt upset most of the day. However by the time I had met up with my friend I felt normal and figured smoking would merely put me to sleep.
