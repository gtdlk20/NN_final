We waltzed back to our room, with me feeling comfortably stoned. Of course that was only the fever at that point, with perhaps a tiny foretaste of what was to come. The main assault was still speeding through my veins, and when it broke through the blood-brain barrier, I went far beyond 'comfortably stoned' or even 'stoned'. But for a little while yet, I sat on my bed unaware of what I was due for, listening to psytrance and stoned babble.
