I was up first the next morning, though I guess that's to be expected, since I never really slept. I watch Benny sleep, the way his nose twitches and his mouth sags just slightly. John is even more fascinating, and when he turns facing me it seems like he knew someone was watching, because his eyes open. He turns around, looks to the hall, and then at me with such open confidence and lazy nonchalance that I have to avert my gaze--almost like he knew that I'd be watching him, like he was waiting for me to figure it out instead of vice versa. I prod Benny until he wakes and then we leave to air out the car. The sweet, heedy smell of pot hangs heavy everywhere--in our clothes, our hair, my hands. The car can't compare with this eye-rolling scent absorbed into my very sweat and skin.
