My lover smokes regularly, and I had tried cookies and candies in the past when an old back injury was acting up, but this was my first time smoking. I hadn't planned to try cannabis that day, but he offered me the pipe, and I said yes. We were far into the park, and plenty of other people were smoking, so I wasn't worried about getting caught. First, I tried to take a hit but kept sucking ashes onto my tongue, and I don't think I managed to really ingest much of anything.
