Well, I have broken peoples mailboxes before and never thought twice about it, but i guess that was guilt surfacing in the back of my mind, but also thoughts of how stupid the things we think are important really are.   It was about 9:10 or so and I decided I wanted to be alone for the rest of the night.  I told my friend goodbye and drove home.  Wanting to re-experience the joy that the classical music gave me earlier, I put my radio on the classical music station and fell into a deep sleep.  I woke up the next morning feeling refreshed, and everything was pretty vivid except for the pool game, all I can remember about it is laughing and making weird noises. I really enjoyed the feelings this weed gave me, and it seemed to me that hydroponic weed really is stronger and better than what is grown in my town.  Overall, this was a very unique and enjoyable expierence, and I hope to feel what I felt sometime again.
