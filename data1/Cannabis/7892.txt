After sitting around until about 7:30, we decided we would play a game of pool.  The game seemed to be endless and we were almost in tears laughing the whole time.  It would be completely quiet and we'd say something completely off the wall or make up some gibberish like 'Scahhshsawashy' and fall to the floor laughing every time.  The conversations we had are almost completely a blur. All I can remember from about 7:30 to 8:00 is laughing.  Finally somehow we managed to finish the game, and we decided to go for a ride.
