For the most part my voyages on weed have been very favorable, I can recall only two intances out of hundreds and hundreds that resulted in a bad trip. I usually smoke free homegrown from my friend which is not to bad, however sometimes I find myself other varieties. I am very curious as to what triggered both of these experiences, I think it may have something to do with the quality of the grass. I usually prefer weed with somewhat of a citrus aroma,I find that these types usually give me an up-beat high. On  both the bad occasions I can recall the weed smelling not just spicy, but somewhat sweet like honey. From now on I will never again smoke weed with that particular aroma.
