Never have I had any negative consequence come from it. I am close to a straight-A student in all AP classes, and am also an athlete. I don't encourage habitual use, but smoking a big fatty once in a while, will give me time to meditate and expand my understanding of my purpose here on earth. I have since smoked almost every weekend, and continue to enjoy the benefits of the sacred herb, without going to hell, moving onto any other drug, jumping out windows, funding terrorists, experiencing amotivational syndrome, or even a loss of memory.
