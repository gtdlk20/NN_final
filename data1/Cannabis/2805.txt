I confided in Chris how attracted I had found myself to Evans girlfriend since the last two days.  Earlier in the day, the two of us had gone for a walk, and now the whole episode as being even more amazing that when I was sober.  I knew it was wrong for me to lust after her like that, but I knew Id make a better boyfriend for her, and I was certain she felt the same way, but it killed me because I couldnt say anything to her, given the circumstances.  It was no longer even about me, I just wanted her to a have a better relationship.
