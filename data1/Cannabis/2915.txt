I suspect this was actually a result of a long, slow buildup.  I began seriously smoking pot when I was 18, I am now 21.  At first I always enjoyed smoking and had a fantastic time.  Over the past year or so, however, I have noticed a pattern of more and more paranoid and depressing thoughts when I am high.  I have a number of friends who have experienced the same pattern, but I don't know if it is the result of some sort of predisposition or if it can solely be attributed to the pot.  Either way, if you have been smoking for a while and are experiencing the same pattern I did, I suggest you ease up on the smoking before something catastrophic occurs as it did in my case.
