After smoking, my friends thought it would be cool to see Lord of the Rings on it's opening day.  I hopped into the driver's seat and immediately realised that I wouldn't be able to drive us anywhere in my condition.  We all piled out and started playing tag in the parking lot.  I made sure that I didn't run too fast so that I wouldn't trip; it wouldn't have hurt at all then, but i would've felt it in the morning.
