I did not know where I was. All I remember is babbling to my friend G about how I had to get home before I would pass-out. He didn't pay attention to me and kept passing the bowl around. We were all very very high at that point. Normal yellow-white lights would appear red and blue. I was scared and wanted to go home and sleep it off. When I stood up, the effects were even stronger. I felt much more disoriented and afraid.
