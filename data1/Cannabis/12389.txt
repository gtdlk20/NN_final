The day after smoking, the voice is almost completely returned to normal. While an open throat is still much easier to achieve, the cells in the throat which were killed by the smoke have yet to completely regenerate, so singing can be slightly painful and some singers complain of excessive mucus on their vocal cords the next day. As to long term effects of smoking marijuana on the voice, the primary one is the damage inflicted on the cilia which are responsible for clearing mucus from the throat. Apparently, it is very easy to identify a smoker by examining their vocal cords, and while cigarettes are not as damaging (because they are filtered) there is clear evidence of damage from pot smoke after only a few uses. Personally, I find that after 36 hours at most, the effects of marijuana on my voice have completely disappeared. For this reason I try not to smoke for approximately 36 hours before a performance.
