When I stood up, my entire body felt light. Like I was filled with helium. It was really weird, but really neat. I was actually pretty tired, so I made my way to our guest room, so as not to wake my wife. I felt a little unsteady walking. When I made it into bed, the covers felt nice, and I could feel the high was still increasing.
