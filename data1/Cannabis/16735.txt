Hash... What a night, a moroccan friend of mine rolled me up a joint full of moroccan hash (he actually knew the guy who made it there, in the Rif mountains, so the quality was really high). I was living with my grandma at that moment, and one night I decided to light it up but I didn't have a lighter so I decided it would be a good idea to heat a paper sheet with a soldering gun until a flame came up...
