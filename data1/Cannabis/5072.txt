Amid our insane laughter, we managed to set up the movie Grandma's Boy on my laptop, and watched as we tried to think of a way to finish the night. Finally, the idea struck us as the movie reached one of its most famous scenes; the main character tells his pot-smoking buddy to roll his myriad marijuanas into one joint. We paused the movie, looked at each other with lunatic grins, laughed our heads off, and reached for the King-Size Rizla rolling papers, rolling machine, and grinder. We mixed up equal parts of Chips' and Burger's savory weed, my laughter-inducing weed, and Ramen's mind-numbing weed with a pinch of tobacco from one of Ramen's Camels, and rolled it into a long, chubby spliff.
