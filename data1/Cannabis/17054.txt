Now, months later, I smoke about 1-3 times a week during weekends trying to be as responsible as I can while still having fun. My first prophetic experience with marijuana begins here. Since I began smoking I have forever longed for those classic moments you hear about people summarizing life, the earth, and life beyond death in amazingly deep quotes. I had yet to think deeply and become one with myself while under the influence of marijuana. Last night my time had come, I smoked with a few of my work buddies at one of their houses. It was a slightly odd setting being I was the only guy there in a room full of bi/lesbian women. Most guys would kill to be in that situation but it is a lot different than first imagined. We lit up in one of their cars after making a food run to a local Mexican joint. I got first greens on the small 1 foot bong we had considering it was my bud and I was smoking out 4 other people. We all smoked about 3 or 4 bowls and I could tell I was starting to feel it. We eventually went back inside the house and ate and sat around and talked while one couple was flirting on the ground. We finished eating and were sitting around just talking and somehow the subject of time came up. It was like a light bulb lit up inside me, I could feel warmth in my chest as I realized I was taping into my inner self and began to elaborate on the subject of time. I said what I felt and what I had thought about before. I continued to speak about how time is so fleeting and you have to make the most out of every second because you will never get that second back, how people shouldnÂ’t fight or make enemies because it is a waste of precious time that you can never take another chance at.
