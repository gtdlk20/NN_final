The mental conversation ended, though, when my girlfriend decided that she was too tired and wanted to go back to the tent. Walking back was one of the hardest things I think I've ever done. My legs were like lead and it seemed very hard to lift them. That, and I was still horribly dizzy. When we finally made it back, I laid down and became very paranoid because I didn't know what was real and what was just going on in my head. The other people that we were with at the campsite were up and yelling stuff and playing their music very loud. Or at least it seemed that way to me. I would randomly hear screams and loud ambient noises and I wasn't sure if any of that noise was audible to anyone else. I eventually tuned it out somehow and went to sleep.
