(t+2.45)  Comming down was unappreciated, i was having too much fun.  But all good things must come to an end. I went inside and joined my friends in a conversation. I tried to bring them outside with me, but no one was interested...i guess that this was a little gift from cannabis, to me.  I was thankful, and hope to be on the receiving end again soon.
