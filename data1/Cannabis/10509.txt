My friends still didn't know what to do with me, but they knew that they had to get me outta public.  But I had no house to go to.  So with their genius they decided to leave me behind the shed of the place where I smoked, so I could chill out, because his parents were home.  So relunctantly, I sat back there, not able to walk or talk I had little way out of it.  One kid stayed out there with me for a little while, but after 1/2 hour or so he saw it hopeless.  I wasn't coming down.  For the next few hours I sat there, drifting in and out of consciousness, and tripping my balls off.  At about 7 or 8 o'clock (I smoked at 3) I finally got the energy to get up and walk home.
