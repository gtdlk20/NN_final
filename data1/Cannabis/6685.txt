My friends were then taking me out of that room and I remember hearing someone say, 'And it's common for this to happen?' as I was trying to stand. When walking down the hall I had to prop myself against the wall and remember sliding alongside it, feeling like a retarded animal, then I became a bird and felt a hiccup of flight before returning to earth somewhat. I began to become very paranoid, my long-time friend played some soothing guitar and tried to calm me down.
