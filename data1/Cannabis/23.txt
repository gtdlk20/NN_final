A few months ago, I had a bit of a freak out (to put it mildly).  I have wanted to write down exactly what happened both in my mind and in the real world, but didnt know how to put it.  Well, Im swallowing my pride and doing it.  Its probably not going to be completely coherent, but it is, at least, honest and a very accurate representation of what I perceived to be happening.  Despite my fears and perceptions, the people involved handled the situation brilliantly and I could not have got through it without them.
