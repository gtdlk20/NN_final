The most striking aspect to me at the time was the extremely vivid ongoing minds-eye/closed eye hallucinations. I pictured all kinds of scenarios and apparitions, most of them cartoonish and inscrutable. The most nagging one was a continuously morphing object which always moved from left-to-right across my visual field, usually against a background of stars. It was a cartoonish object which I felt sure represented a motif from my childhood (probably a show I used to watch) however I felt that it never took its true form and instead was morphing through related/reminiscent shapes: a tennis shoe, a shark, a rollerblade, a car, a space shuttle, a lightning bolt, an electric guitar, a pizza slice. I had the very uncomfortable feeling that none of these were really what the object was. The cartoonish visions sometimes became very present and 3D. One recurring 3D image/sensation was of an enormous fungal venus flytrap which filled the space around me and closed around my body.
