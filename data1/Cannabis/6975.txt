I eventually managed to get home, with the paranoia slowly wearing off after a couple of hours or so. Whilst walking home I was still suffering from aural hallucinations but strangely, as soon as I heard something I knew it was the weed and not anything more serious. I walked past two men in a car park, and was convinced that one of them insulted me - I can't remember quite what it was I thought they said, but I do remember that it was something that, when sober, seemed less of an insult than just a strange random remark.
