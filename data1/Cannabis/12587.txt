We walked right down to this football pitch. We sat down on a bench and I started tripping again, same as before but this time when I closed my eyes I saw 3 big circles suspended in a black mist. They were worlds as I was calling them. Some how I start getting this feeling of looking at my friend and me though my mind, we were in one of these worlds that I was looking at. We decided to walk around the oval. I was fascinated by everything, it seemed as though it was the first time I was doing anything. My friend start joking about how trashed I was. He instructed me to pickup a pinecone, I picked it up, I started walking towards him and he ran away. I was confused, apparently I picked up a piece of dog shit, I swear I thought it was a pinecone.
