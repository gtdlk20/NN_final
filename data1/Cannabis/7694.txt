My friend called me up when his parents left the house and told me that the house was empty for half an hour. I roller-bladed over, (was 15 at the time and didn't have a ride), and quickly stumbled onto his back patio. He had already prepared a make-shift bong out of a 3-liter cranberry juice bottle. He pulled out his little baggy of sweet, fruity smelling weed, which must've had at least 4 grams in it, and proceeded to pack the bowl. He warned me that this was by far the strongest Sativa he had ever smoked. (Where we live, we're used to getting shitty mass-produced Mexican Indica, which gives you a body high but doesn't lift you up. This on the otherhand, was homegrown and had made it all the way from Vancouver,BC courtesy of a friend...and I believe was somehow related to Thai.) Anyway...We lit this monster bowl up and kept hitting it straight for about 5 minutes. By the time I had finished, I felt warm and tingly..a sensation I had felt with my previous experiences...but nothing could've prepared me for what was about to come.
