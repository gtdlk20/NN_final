Sorry for rambling, I just had to share this experience. It was very pleasant, although at times quite breathtaking. I will try to reach this state again, but I'm not sure that weed alone is responsible for this. Another thing I learned is that the setting and your state of mind just before the trip are *very* important. Overall, this trip was very enlightening to me, and made me reconsider several things I took for granted about reality.
