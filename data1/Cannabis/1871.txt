At about 6:30pm it was time for me to meet my friend so I came back to my desk and started clearing up. All of a sudden it hit me! And I mean hit me hard! I have a good amount of experience with psychadelics and this was very much like tripping! If it were not for the crazy physical sensations I started having, I would have thought someone slipped me some shrooms or the like.
