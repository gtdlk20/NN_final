I started off the day by meeting another friend in the towns park and had a couple of joints from the 1/8 I had bought. Everything was fine until I started to feel a bit off. I wasnt feeling comfortable in my stomach, however much food and drink I filled it with it, the feeling didnt pass. I was stoned and was already mongin (going into my own quiet world). The bus ride was particularly unpleasant because I was sure that by the time I was off the bus I wouldve vomited over the woman sitting in front of me. No puke yet. When PiC and me had arrived at his, Bous was already skinning up. Meat turned up little later.
