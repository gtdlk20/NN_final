Well, the last funny thing to happen was I closed my eyes while we were walking and I could still picture the suroundings as if my eyes were open, but it was changing colors like crazy. . .until, SLAM! I walked right into the raised bridge. . .5 minutes later I noticed I had a huge gash on my arm, and continued to go off on my friend for about 5 more minutes about how they should have told me the bridge was there.
