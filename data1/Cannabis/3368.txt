I sat on my bed cross-legged, and looked at my legs. There were no hallucinations or distortions in what I visually saw, but things just didnt feel normal. I went into the kitchen, and to the fridge to eat part of a muffin, the muffin tasted intense, more recognised through the senses, as has been the case when I have eaten before whilst stoned or on magic truffles. But then I looked around me, at my furniture, and things just didnt feel right, or normal as I was used to them.
