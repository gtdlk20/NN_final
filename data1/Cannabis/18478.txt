I looked around at Monster and Fuck-Up, the only two inside now, and exclaimed my well rehearsed line in the car, 'So...this is where the mighty [name here] resides.' He laughed a bit, then concurred with my statement before I set in for my next line of dialouge (also well rehearsed), 'So...I know I just got here, and not wanting to come off like a dick or anything, could I use your bathroom?' Once more he ind of laughed and directed me to the second door on the left stating, 'It's a trailer, not too hard to figure out.' I then, once again, went to the bathroom, pissed off because I was still going to the bathroom.
