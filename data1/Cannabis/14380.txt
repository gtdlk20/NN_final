Farmer talked Jim down and then took us for a walk.  Jim rode that first big wave of paranoia and then began to see a point of clarity that he could operate from, and we began to talk and sort out what we were feeling and thinking.  The waves seemed to stem from deep-seated fears or traumatizing events.  These were new stretches of the horizon for Jim, and to rush into it with little or no introduction, and to such depths I cannot imagine.  I tease him about it still, but never belittle.
