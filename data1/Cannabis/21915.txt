Back to first camera my head continues to raise (note: not I raised my head) back to normal sitting back in my chair position, then further back till I couldn't move it back any further. While my head has been moving back, I have been flying higher and higher. When my head tilted full back I was flying so high!! and I felt the falling/flying sensation, that tension. Hope you know what I mean. Laughing FIT while my head was in full back tilt. Could not stop laughing. Tried to explain it to my friend while having a laughing fit, which eventually reverted to a huge smile. :D
