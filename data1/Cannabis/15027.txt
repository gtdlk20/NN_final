This was my first pot experience. I had tried smoking it for three consecutive nights, nothing happened. It all happened on the fourth night. I have been lately dealing with 'issues' - nothing too bad, but repressed events of my life, realizing just how I have compressed time and selectively forgotten events. I was well prepared if these issues surfaced. I can't say I fully remember every second clearly, but I sure can accurately give details about the majority of my trip. After smoking about 7 hoots in a 20 minute period, I still felt normal. I took one more hit.
