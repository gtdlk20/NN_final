Then my friend offered to let me go down the hill.  This, of course, involved me walking up the hill, so I began the long march.  I remember feeling like my voice was a springboard.  This is very hard to describe.  My voice felt very high-pitched, so I was trying to force it down to its normal pitch.  I now know that I thought I was moving through at least fourteen octaves (if you sing you understand that only the best singers can do even eight).  My voice was very high, and as I forced it down, I thought it was becoming more like my normal voice (which is quite low).  But as soon as I stopped trying to hold it down, it shot back up.  I think I was in fact making myself quieter, not lower.
