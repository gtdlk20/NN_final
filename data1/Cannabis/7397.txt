I can definitely feel the difference, somewhat spaced out, somewhat lighter. Every muscle in my face is active, and I'm aware of them all, individually. Suddenly I feel very active and playful, as I usually do when high, so I put on Queens Of The Stone Age to get the vibe going. Five minutes pass, but its like an eternity. I can feel the air around my limbs as though it is thickening, and start to get some intense closed-eye visuals, in which figures move in tune to the music. This world is green and muddy, much like a swamp. I open and close my eyes, going between the Green and T's Room, Its utterly fascinating for a while. Then Nos (who never, ever feels the effects as intensely as I do) realises my situation and starts to laugh and ask me stupid questions, presumably to get me to say some gibberish for his entertainment (as I usually do...). But not tonight. This is too real, too wonderful so I close my eyes and thrash about madly on the floor, swimming through the Green.
