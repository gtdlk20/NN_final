I was convinced that I was a cartoon dog and that my face was all droopy while I laughed.  I could not stop laughing until I noticed how hungry I was.  I seriously ate about 2 full packs of Chips Ahoy cookies.  I noticed then that I had no idea what was happening, I had no idea what time it was and if I saw I clock I wouldn't have understood.  I was so confused by everything.  I was having fun but then I became nervious and felt really paranoid.  My face was twitching so I decided that if I took a shower I might start to feel ok since I felt as if I was on fire.
