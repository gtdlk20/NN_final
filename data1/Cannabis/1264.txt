16:30 still pretty busy here. Heading back outdoors for a spliff in the sunshine with Sister Moon! It is FUCKING hot out there today. I LOVE it like this, it's not even that humid. Kinda reminds me of Ibiza today, except Ibiza is humid! I think the effects peaked about half hour ago, I feel as though I might be on the downslope now. Not certain or anything, if this is anything like the orginal L, it's bound to ease off in waves, much like it started of course...
