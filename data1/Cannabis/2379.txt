1:30 am: Now Im scared. Sitting in the dark has a weird effect on my high, the above effects described were at least doubled, I try to remember when I ate the weed and it scares me more to realize that I might have a long way to go before I start to come down. Then I notice that my heart seems to be beating very fast, this cause me to breath more through my mouth, which in turn dries out my entire throat which scares me even more. I almost start to panic; I breathe so heavy it feels like I will pass out. What will happen if Mom and Dad see me freak out? Will the kick me out of the house? Can you OD on weed? No. No one ever has, thats a dumb thought.
