Upon returning home after brunch, we were preparing to part ways. This time, I took one rather large hit for the road. We walked out into the street. I was feeling rather disappointed that nothing more significant than sensation perception enhancement was going to happen. It's a shame, I thought, that my first experience was so nightmarish but that this time, I was going to feel almost nothing too significant.  About ten minutes had elapsed. I said good-bye to my friend and proceeded to take a walk outdoors.  It was at this moment, upon being alone, that I realized that I have a lot of difficulty containing my facial muscles, which keep morphing into a huge smile. Suddenly, I burst out in laughter. I walked about a block bending over in uncontrollable laughter. There was no particular reason for this, I decided, and becoming paranoid of the fact that others might see me in this dumb state, I tried to reason with myself; 'Just remember what you told yourself before you got high: You said that you would remind yourself that this is only a drug and that, by understanding the situation, you would feel comfortable with letting go and enjoying it'. This worked in quelling the paranoia. I put on my headphones and enjoyed the mild euphoria, like a million little ants in my chest, and desire to laugh all the way home.
