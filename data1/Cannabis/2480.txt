It must have been a couple of hours, because I'm stiff and aching. I push myself into a sitting position and press the heels of my hands into my eyes. The hall light is back on and I assume John has the munchies or ran to the bathroom, so I let my eyes wander. Benny is on the carpet, half-covered by a blue comforter, and John is fast asleep on the couch. He has the blanket I left on the chair, his face covered with it, unruly hair poking out the top. I notice how much taller and leaner he looks laying out like that, all open and stretched end-to-end of the green sofa. In the reflection of the television screen I see a man with long gray hair and an orange shirt sitting at a table. The colors aren't moving so I guess I've come down. My heartbeat quickens and I lay back down, and within minutes I'm half-asleep again.
