I had to turn the stereo off so that I could keep every ounce of focus that I had left on the road. I drove at the 10 and 2 positions, going no faster than 20 miles an hour and taking every residential detour possible that could get us to where we needed to be. I was seeing nothing but frames, like watching a slow movie projector. My sense of depth and coordination were completely out on vacation. God it felt like we were driving for hours, and I had no idea where the hell we were but it wasn't our town. Finally we somehow reached my area and John had me pull over at the neighborhood convenience store so that he could get something to drink and some gum to conceal the crime we committed.
