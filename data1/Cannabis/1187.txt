I still could not connect with my body, but I remember that I had the realization that everything I thought was real to me in my life was really just a wakeful dream. This was something I had thought about a lot before, that we are just going through life believing everything to be real just because our perception and thinking tells us so. However, it is a complete different thing experiencing it with your own consciousness, seeing the illusion that this material reality is.
