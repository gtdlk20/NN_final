I looked at something on the wall, and in a couple seconds my visual field tunneled, with the periphery blurring, and the center becoming very clear, almost seeming closer or zoomed-in. I was familiar with the sensation, as it was a really exaggerated version of something I've experienced many times during sitting meditation when staring at an object for 90 seconds or so. Moving my eyes made everything normal again, but if kept my eyes in one place everything would tunnel. So it was basically the same thing, but it happened in 2 seconds instead of 90s. I thought that was cool.
