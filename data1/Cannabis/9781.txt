After the first bowl was done, we looked at each other. Without saying anything, we began packing another bowl. A silent language of the stoner, told in bloodshot eyes and stupid grins. When the 2nd round of bowls had been finished, we thought we were done. But then Mike saw that we still had weed left and said we had to finish it. So we all smoked another bowl each.
