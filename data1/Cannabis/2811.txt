I was the first person up the next morning, at about 7:30 am, feeling incredibly well rested.  I was still a bit high, and I decided to head off to the pier again as I slowly grappled my way back into soberbia.  I was good after about 45 minutes on the pier.  I had enjoyed my trip and taken much from it, but I came to realize that the me whom is clear headed and sober is whom I truly am.  I felt like I was being welcomed home with open arms after a long journey, it was wonderful.  I sat there, overlooking the lake and smiling.  Sometimes you dont realize how good something is until its gone, I had missed being myself immensely by then end of the night.  I had never felt so much love for myself as I did at that moment.  And it wasnt drugs making me happy, it was this new, absence of drugs!
