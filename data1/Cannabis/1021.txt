Saturday evenings are typically uneventful for me, as I am always off work and most my friends aren't. I spent the day with my girlfriend, and after she left for her job I became bored as hell. I tried calling a few people but no one was able to hang out, so I contacted A, a friend that I had not spent significant time with for a couple years, but with whom I still maintained some contact. He told me he was going to eat dinner with his girlfriend's family, and then he'd come over. He also said that he had some really good weed and that we could smoke it if I wanted to do so. I said that I would love that, and I went home to play some music and clear my mind. At about 8:30 A arrived. We talked a bit for a while, and then got down to the deed. As he was loading the bowl, he explained that he shared one bowl with four people and got extremely high. I was impressed, as A was a frequent smoker, and a bit nervous to be truthful. We went outside, and I took the first hit. The smoke was so strong that it had barely hit my lungs before I coughed it out. From then on I took much smaller hits until we cashed the bowl. It didn't take long for the effects to kick in, and by the time we walked inside, I felt much higher than I ever had.
