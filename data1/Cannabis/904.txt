When I got outside, everything seemed good and happy. However I started feeling odd about other people on the street. I would like to be just alone, myself. I was walking the sidewalk and started laughing again. A small distance in front of me was a kiosk, where they knew me and I was fearful they would find out, and again I laughed with this silly thought. I also had fleeting negative thoughts about stumbling and falling, injuring myself and going to the hospital or even dying, where they would test me and they would find out what I had consumed and everyone would know and be shocked and angry with me. I have a moderate level of paranoia in my normal life as well, and I imagine making such thoughts about other things while sober, so I donÂ’t think it was purely the effect of the herb.
