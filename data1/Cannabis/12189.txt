So I put my headphones on, hit the play button and closed my eyes. As soon as the first beat started, it immediately hit me. I wouldn't say that it was a total hallucination, but it's like the weed had heightened my imagination and my perception to such a great extent that I was visually seeing the music in my head. The whole song was linear in that it was happening along some kind of track, with a black background. It's like it was one long and skinny wave that changed as the music changed. It started off as some kind of rod with all sorts of black pistons driving out of it, and then the true melody of the song hit. This ribbon was born out of the pistons, it had tons of tiny little spikes driving out of it, making it look fuzzy. Each spike was a different color, and it was also striped different colors along it's length. When the song's melody would change, the ribbon would pulse while flowing along from the beginning to the end. As the music would die down a bit, the ribbon would as well, and then slowly the energy would start building up, climaxing, the ribbon just hit some kind of crazy peak and exploded, going faster and bursting with more energy than ever.
