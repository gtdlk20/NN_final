Afterwards I left the party at an unknown time, and headed to a place I'd arranged for myself to sleep in, but sleep ofcourse, was no option. I kept slowly drinking beer and smoking alone the entire night, feeling, pondering. I think after the actual onset around 1 AM the actual rising of it took like 12 hours or so. The visuals were truly great, so flexible and somehow controllable.
