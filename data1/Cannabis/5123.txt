We leave the bridge and go to one of my girl coworker's friends' house. My friend D passed on smoking from the bubbler, and when we came to this guys' house, D wanted to leave. He didn't want to be around us smoking, so he walked home. So I meet this guy, his name is Alex, and we all go into his shed. Apparently he was a huge stoner, his parents smoked weed and didn't care that he did it. So in his shed, there's a circle of folding chairs. We all come in, he shuts the door, and pulls out a bong. I remember commenting on how it looked 'trippy' (mind you, at this point, I was still pretty high). He loads up a bowl and hands it to one of my coworkers. She hits it, then passes it to me. I hold it to my lips, light the bowl and pull out the slider after inhaling for about 5 seconds. I blow out a pretty decent amount of smoke and hand it to my friend Jazzy.
