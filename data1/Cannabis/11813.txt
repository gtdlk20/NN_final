This prior time a few months earlier, my girlfriend and I had smoked a bowl of hydro on my porch at home, and soon after I got back inside I felt waves of warm numbness come over me, and my vision began to shift and blur, and I got nauseous and ended up lying on the bathroom floor ready to puke for 10-15 minutes. However, I ended up not puking, and was able to force myself to return to baseline very quickly, and became extremely tired for the next hour and a half.
