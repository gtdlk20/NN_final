7:35 I woke up in bed without knowing how I got there. I felt like I'd slept for hours but it had only been a few minutes. Again I wanted to sleep, but I had a fear that if I did I'd never wake up. I suddenly became aware that our apartment was a little messy and it bothered me. I was going to clean, but I was very unsteady and suddenly very forgetful. I walked into the kitchen and immediately forgot why I was there. I decided not to clean, worrying that I would hurt myself. So I went back to the bed. Again, minutes felt like a long time.
