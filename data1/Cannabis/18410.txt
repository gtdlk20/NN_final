Then, I finally rose from bed at roughly three p.m. and walked outside my room. Chaos abounded. My mom was cleaning the house for some unknown reason before it clicked that it was the fourth of July. She sees me...first thing I get instead of a 'good morning' or whichever greeting applies was, 'Weren't you supposed to do this?' I tell her I was going to clean the house tomorrow (Friday), and ask who ask coming over. She replied to me with, 'Charlie and Cynthia....your dad invited them...' I asked her why I hadn't been told this and she gave me this trip somewhere around the lines of, 'You knew damn well they were coming over...' and I laid things out for her. Simply, I did not know. I asked her several times before what her plans were, hoping they would leave the house. Everytime I got the answer, 'I don't know, nothing yet.' Apparently, she recalled differently. I gave her the usual rounaround: 'Whatever...I didn't know anything about it and I planned on cleaning tomorrow.' Then, very pissed  as I was, I went back to my room.
