Like any other day, my brother and I were driving to Ultimate Frisbee practice at the local park, rolling some joints and listening to Phish, when we met up with three other frisbee companions and proceeded to smoke all five joints in our van, when we finished, ready and in the proper state of mind for a serious game of frisbee, we stepped out of the billowing side door and walked from the parking lot five feet to the field. Immediately, I felt the calming effects of the tasty bud, and kept humming my favorite Phish song (bouncing around the room), when it happened.
