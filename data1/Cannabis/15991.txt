Anyway, I think that's the most intense high I've ever experienced with Mary Jane.  I don't know what exactly triggered it either... And going by other accounts, it doesn't appear to be a normal reaction.  My only explanation is that I take certain medication for seizures, but then why wouldn't it occur every time I do it?
