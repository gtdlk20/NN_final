It didn't taste too good, but I downed the large drink in no time.  I had read and heard about very intense trips on Bhang Lassi, some horrible.  I have been smoking and baking with Marijuana for about 3 years, but I have found that when it comes to eating it, the results are almost always intense and I can't expect the same thing.
