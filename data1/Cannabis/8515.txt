Oh, what a great night it was indeed.  My best friend and I decided to go out and by some weed and go for a car ride.  She was driving.  We packed a bowl (a glass one with a carb) and we were both so pumped up to smoke because we both had a stressful day studying for tests.  I packed the bowl and I gave it to her to spark it.  She did, and smiled at me, then let out all this smoke.
