While I was on my 10 day leave after boot camp and before combat training, I stupidly decided to smoke marijuana knowing I would receive a urinalysis at the end of it.  About 4 or 5 days into leave I shared a bowl of mid-grade cannabis between two friends and myself.  At 8.5 days (1.5 days before test!) I was intoxicated from alcohol and took 2 hits from a joint of low grade cannabis.  Needless to say I felt like a complete idiot the next day.
