Then I stumbled upon the article that would teach me how to vape without coughing, and inadvertently get me super high.  Basically, it explained that what one wants to do is draw to create the vapor (with either mouth suction, or inhalation), and then chase it with a giant column of *fresh* air to get the vapor deep into the lungs. I've read in other articles that THC absorbtion is small in the mouth and throat, so this made sense to me. I must not have been getting the vapor far enough into my lungs.
