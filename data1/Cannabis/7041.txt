My buddy Rob was digging on that part of the song as well, because it had a strange quality to it.  I've never been a really a big noticer of visuals when I smoke cannabis, but I think the cues from the music were throwing me into a bit of sensory overload, because this is the point at which my cannabis-laced perception of Nick Cave's song went into Whale Overdrive.  By this time,  I was picking up some cool, firefly-sized whitish-yellow tracers swerving from the speakers.  The tracers seemed to time themselves with the flourishes of guitar in the song, as the speaker closest to me would release staccatto spurts of squiggling, tracing 'pellets' of light.  It was as though the notes of music were giving birth to little bullets of light, sending these revved-up, electrofunk babies streaking out through the pulsating woofers of the speaker.
