8:30am I woke up not feeling rested at all. My mouth was dry and sticky. I felt hung over. How could just weed do all this? I felt hung over. How could just weed do all this? Part of it was, I'm sure, because I ate it instead of smoking. I also think my emotional state played a huge role. Much like on acid, I felt a clash between my soul, who I truly am, and all the outside influences including my own mind. Negative thoughts tried to get in my way, things I'd been suppressing could no longer be suppressed. I feel like my mind cleansed and reorganized itself. I realized I'd been dwelling on trivial nonsense instead of seeing the whole world, my whole life.
