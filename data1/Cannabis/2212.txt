As Hughie went to pack the small glass bowl a second time I shook my head at him. 'I want to forget who I am tonight.' I said jokingly. I pointed towards his room where I knew the gravity bong was located. Without hesitation he opened his door and began to prepare the bong. His warning didn't come until he had begun to take his lighter from his pocket, but it was stern. 'I'm telling you... you've never been this high, and you will never be this high again.' he said. I laughed as I began to hunch over the top of the glass bottle. 'I've been smoking pot for a long time, and I've smoked from this thing before, I'm sure I can handle it.' I retorted. He shook his head at me, but lit the pack and smiled. 'I warned you.' he said.
