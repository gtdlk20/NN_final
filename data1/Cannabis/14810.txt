'I love you too,' I said to the friend with my trademark goofy grin. This was great. I felt wonderful all over. Panorama vision dissolved into the wallpaper climbing up the wall. Very funny things would happen, to the amusement of my friends. For example, I decided to get rid of all the stuff I had in my pockets. So instead of just logically laying them down somewhere, I had to walk into the den and place them on the TV. The thing was, I'd stumble in there, put one item down and stumble back into the kitchen. Realizing my mistake, I'd repeat the process, several times I might add.
