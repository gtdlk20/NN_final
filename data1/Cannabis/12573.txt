Now when I first ever smoked marijuana I did not get all that high. I had nearly 10 pipes with no effect! I smoked out of nothing but pipes for the first 3-4 months of my 'stoner' period. So I used marijuana nearly daily for 3-4 months then suddenly stopped smoking it for 8 months. This one particular day my friend urged me to come smoke some dope, because I hadn't had the buzz in a long while I agreed. I really was anticipating getting stoned, the whole walk back to his place I couldn't stop thinking about it.
