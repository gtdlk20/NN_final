I wasn't sure if I was high or not so I tried to put my feelings into words, but I don't think my friends could understand.  C began to state that everything was 'going into strobe mode,' so I figured he was high too.  We rode the four wheelers around a bit more and then retired back to the cabin.  It was now about 6pm.
