As soon as I am done breathing it in...I start coughing uncontrollably.  I feel as though I am coughing up a lung. I can't stop no matter how hard I try. I ask Matt for some water and can't even swallow it. I open my eyes and everything around me is pixelated.  A million bouncing squares in the dimly lit room.  Everything around me is in slow motion.  My senses are so heightened that the sound of the T.V made me want to tear my ears off.
