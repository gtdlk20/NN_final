vaio - Rapture (Deep Dish Remix) - This is a good one cos I played this not long before I got stoned. Played this over a couple of times, the kicks were very nice, I understood the singing a great deal more - the 'la la la la' parts I could even understand what she was saying there. (I have shit memory of the rest of the details soz)
