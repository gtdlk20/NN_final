Getting tired, so I lie on the couch to watch TV. When I wake up, 2 hours have passed. When I walk around I am still not walking straight, but the effect has decreased a lot. I am hungry and my sense of hearing is still more acute than normal. It is weird that the effect is mostly gone, but hearing small sounds far away, still freaks me out a little. Is this the paranoia after smoking this, that so many talk about?
