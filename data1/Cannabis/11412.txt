I watched him play counterstrike for a few moments, and made a mental note of how damn good he was. I saw his brain shifting through gears, monitoring every pixel on the screen. I saw his reflexes fly off the charts. I saw how dumb I looked staring, transfixed on the computer screen and snapped out of it. Wait....I snapped out of it? I needed more, I told myself. I climbed out of the window once more, packed another bowl, and smoked it myself. Oh, the sweet sensation. I went back inside, and used some Rhoto V for my eyes. It was the best sensation my eyes have ever felt. I could see my eyes dancing beneath the coat of ice that the eye drops had put over them. Wait, I could see my own eyes?
