I get this feeling that my brain constantly tries to predict what it is going to happen, and then when something else happens, I become aware of it, slightly confused, because I thought the thing my brain predicted had actually happened. This feeling of things happening that are not supposed to happen is interesting. It is just minor things, like which hand I will put in the pocket, what something would feel like when I touch it or what kind of sound I will hear when I open the door etc. The incongruence between what happens and what I thought would happen is noticable and slightly weird.
