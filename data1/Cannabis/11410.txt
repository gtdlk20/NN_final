As expected, I kicked ass. In fact, I was kicking so much ass that, unfortunately, I died on the first level because time ran out. Man, and I thought I was going too quickly. Level 1-2 must have been a breeze, seeing as I don't remember playing it. I then warped to 4-1, and rather than killing everything in my path, I realized that these creatures meant me no harm, and I just stuck to avoiding them through the rest of the level. I then found myself at 8-1. What is it with me and having no recollection of playing the underground levels? I stumbled through 8-1 and 8-2 and got to 8-3. In 8-3, I engaged in several epic battles with the hammer brothers...and got my ass kicked. I stared at the 'game over' screen for about 30 seconds and then realized that I didn't know where I was. I looked around and realized I was still at my friend's house.
