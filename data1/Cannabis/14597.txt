We piled into my car and I volunteered to sit in the back seat.  As we started driving, I was finding it more and more difficult to concentrate on anything and was starting to feel a little bit dizzy and nauseous.  To try and calm myself, I closed my eyes and tried to focus on consuming the racing thought in my head rather then the racing scenery shooting by the car.  That's when one of my friends turned on the radio.  Peter Gabriel was playing.  It was 'In Your Eyes,' what some may consider a cheesy love ballad to be sure.  But with my eyes closed shut and the radio blaring in my ears, it was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard.
