We entered my suite (3 rooms of 2 people), and then went into my room. My suitemates don't smoke (they hate smoking) and I dislike my roommate, so I was very uncomfortable, and I felt my incredible high dissipating because I didn't want to be there. I told C, and we got up and decided to go to her room (she has a single) on the other side of campus. The walk over was refreshing, my legs weren't too bad.
