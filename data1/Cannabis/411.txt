And so that was it.  From the depths of hell to the rapture of heaven  my first extended hallucination was nothing if not far-ranging.  I never did find out for sure what it was that caused the hallucinations.  Rick swears to this day that it wasnt laced with anything and that he didnt experience anything other than being really stoned.  However, Mike had an experience that was similar in intensity to mine.  I dont really have much choice but to believe Rick and assume that it was just exceptionally potent cannabis - in which case I have just gained a HUGE amount of respect for what I used to consider just weed.
