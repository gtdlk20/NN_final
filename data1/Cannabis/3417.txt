Up until about April 14th of this years school year, I did absolutely nothing illegal or mind changing. Although I hadnt forgotten about drugs, I had pretty much given up because none of my friends had access to drugs and I had no wishes of ever doing nutmeg again. In the beginning of April however, my best friend was introduced to weed and became a regular smoker. After a couple failed attempts at smoking together (our plans didnt work out for one reason or another) we finally got our shit straight and she invited me over on a Saturday afternoon.
