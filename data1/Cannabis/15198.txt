I was sitting on the floor of my friend Debra's room one evening, when a friend of hers came round to see her.  They hadnt seen each other for ages and just sat there chatting and catching up, and basically just ignored me.  Id never met Suzy before, and I started to listen to some of what was said.  As I did so, something began to happen.
