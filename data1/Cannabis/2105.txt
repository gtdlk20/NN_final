A few hours ago, my friend (whom, for the sake of anonymity, Ill call Catalano) asked me if I wanted to come over and smoke with him a girl named Rayanne (yep, another pseudonym).  I decided to go, since I was bored.  She was excited to teach her methods of efficient smoking to me, the newbie, and she told me that I could be a part of their circle of friends.  I politely mumbled that I couldnt be a full time druggie, and she assured me that in no time Id be snorting coke.  So I decided to leave it at that.
