We arrived at the local school, obviously Zim's favourite smoke pit at the time. I remember walking behind the school is anxious anticipation. Zim took the joint out and offered me first hit, I told him to go ahead. It wasn't until a few hits had gone by before I decided to take the hit. I took the joint in my hands and my heart started to pound in my chest, I could barely grip the joint I was so nervous. I moved the shaking joint to my mouth until I could feel the paper on my lips and smell the smoke billowing in front of my eyes. I pulled hard, eyes closed and pulled some more. I had taken way to big a hit way to fast, in short, I coughed like a little bitch.
