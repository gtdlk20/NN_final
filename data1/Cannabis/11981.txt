I woke up the next morning feeling completely fine, as usual after a night of smoking. I guess the reason I blacked out was my body's overall state. I guess I hadn't recovered well enough from the night before and smoking that joint had been a breaking point almost. For now I think I am going to slow down on my smoking and even try to quit for a couple months. My body has been in bad remission since the summer and I owe it a break from drugs in general.
