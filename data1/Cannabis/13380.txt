We smoked what little was left in the bowl in one round, and Jess repacked tightly.  After a few passes I started to feel the effects, and as a seasoned smoker I could tell it was going to be a very physical high.  Nat and Jess didn't smoke all that often, but they continued to keep up with me and my twin, who can smoke all day long.  I started to get the giggles like crazy and everything was hilarious to me.  I was having trouble keeping up with a story that Jess was telling us, and enjoyed the nonsense that I shot back at her when she tried to explain.
