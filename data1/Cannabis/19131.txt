In terms of my awareness of my surroundings...It's difficult to describe this without being really confusing and roundabout...The way I saw and thought about things was very similar to any movie or movie preview or something where the editors take several clips of a particular scene and place them all one after the other, even though in reality five or ten minutes may have passed between each clip. I would exchange a few words with Kathy, then we'd both fall into silence for a moment, and then I'd look back up at her and realize that I'd completely forgotten she was there, and I would have no memory of just having talked to her. Usually for those first few moments of realization I'd think she was a hallucination I was having (eventually, that began really to unnerve me, so I asked her to hold onto my arm, which made it a little better, but I was still pretty startled every time I looked at her). I had many consecutive trains of thought, but they were all very brief and died out one after the other. So, the end result of all of that is that everything felt incredibly disjointed.
