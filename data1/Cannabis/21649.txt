 The second time is one day, I had the brilliant idea of smoking 4 joints before going to school. I had been smoking for under a month, (2 weeks to be exact) and I was buying A grade weed. This stuff gets me fucked to this day and it was amazing that I was using that for practice. I went to school and fell asleep leaning against my locker only to be awaken by the Special Ed teacher tapping on my head and telling me I still had 10 minutes left until class. She knew I was on-top-of-the-moon stoned at that point because it was blatantly obvious. The only people who didn't notice were the kids who thought I was just some weird kid, so me being baked just registered to them as me being weird. (Grade 8) I went to my first class which happened to be double science, and I promptly started tripping balls, including a point where I completely forgot what my name was and so I decided I was Patrick Swasy for 10 minutes. The next class was math. We had a test that day, and being fucked beyond any inkling of a doubt kinda impairs my ability to do anything. It was at this point I blacked out and have no idea what happened the rest of the day, but apparently I had two more tests that day, and also apparently I got an A on all three tests I took that day.
