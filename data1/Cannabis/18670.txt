Somehow I reached the food-court and we chilled for a little bit at a table when I was staring at S and he was talking in a weird language and telling me to buy a book at Wal-Mart without moving his lips.  I asked him what he was saying and he told me I was hearing the Skytron monitor.  The Skytron was a huge TV above the food court that played constant commercials.  Anyway I stopped and watched the beautiful scene and let my worries fade when R looked at me and asked me if I heard the robot.  I was hearing a constant sound for a while now, not realizing it was a robot till R said something.  Normally I would get freaked out about something like this and hate myself for smoking bud.  This time I said , 'yeah' and sat back and relaxed and lived/loved life for what time I had left till the robot came to kill me.  It never did.
