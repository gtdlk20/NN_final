Finally I fell asleep and woke up two hours later with something like a marijuana high but only physical effects, nothing mental.  I guess from all the looking back I've done onto that experience I've come to the conclusion that 'trips' on marijuana aren't for everyone.  Not many people seem to experience stuff like I did on marijuana but the people that have all have gained something from it.  It was a great experience and even though it was so unpleasant at times, if I could do it again I would (I don't mean smoke weed, I mean have a 'trip' from weed).
