Wen I got back I gave my cousin her food and then got back in line for the concert.  While I was waiting I couldnt tell if time was going by fast or slow.  I didnt say a word the whole time.  I just stared  in the same place the whole time.  But while I was waiting I was listening to this guy (who was clearly drunk) keep saying the same thing over and over again.  It was like 'your the greatest man' or something like that.  And it was getting annoying.  So I found myself bursting out 'shut up!' and he did.  Wow that was random from the girl who doesnt say anything.
