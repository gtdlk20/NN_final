All of this was in a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions that flashed by frighteningly quickly.  I stared paralyzed and wide-eyed at the computer screen, which was displaying the exit graphic for the game.  There was a constant klaxon blaring in my ears.  This sound may have been the single worst part of the entire experience.  The only word I can think of to describe it is oppressive.  It was oppressively loud, oppressively low, oppressively bone/mind rattling.  My consciousness fractured into several different pieces.  One still feebly trying to shut down the computer  one, almost completely detached from the rest, keeping a running monologue and record of the events (at the moment it was repeating the less than helpful mantra This is hell.  This is hell.)  one taking in the incredibly terrifying scene.  Most of the aforementioned pain was focused in a burning sensation that enveloped my whole body.  The game screen was made up most of shades of orange and yellow  which whether or not it caused the burning sensation  did not help.  After several terrifying moments, I somehow managed to turn the computer off.
