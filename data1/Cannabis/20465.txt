We watched the infamous, stoner's favorite movie, 'Half Baked.'  Our friend Kris came over after that and we smoked another bowl.  Then I put one together and we smoked it (I make a TIGHT bowl!).  Afterwards, we WALKED to Kris's house and I felt like I was floating, like my feet weren't touching the ground.  I didn't talk much either..I don't think I talked at all really.  But we got to Kris's house and went to the basement where the band equipment is set up and all.
