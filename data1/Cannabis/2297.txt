Sunday night, I had just returned from a flight to D.C., and due to a slight hunger and lack of sleep, I had a minor but persistent headache. I had rolled two cigarette-sized joints a week before, but IÂ’d used one, and I only had one left. Rather recklessly, I decided to smoke up despite the fact that both all my siblings and my parents were home. I planned my trip pretty meticulously, I would empty my bag from D.C., then strip down, smoke the joint in the bathroom with the window open and the fan on, then take a shower after I finished the joint. Hopefully the telltale smells would have wafted out the window and I would be clean, literally and figuratively.
