So after my first year in high school in the summer, my friend and I grab some proper kush from his area and decide to smoke it in the forest beside a swimming pool, this was on a bright summer day. We sit on a log to enjoy our burn sesh and my friend takes the first hit out of the pipe. I watched him to see how this works. Then I take my hit. At that point I thought that I had a small hit, but it turns out my first hit was huge, maybe a .3. Halfway through my hit I feel like I'm going to die from coughing, and my lungs and throat were irritating like a bitch. I hold my hit in for as long as I can until my lungs start to hurt. After my exhale, I literally couldent see anything, my vision went all black for about 5 seconds and after that it hit me right away.
