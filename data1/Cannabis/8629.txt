There had been a couple times where i had smoked weed and never caught off of it.  I always questioned why people did it and spoke so highly of it.  I never quite understood this.  Then one time, after school one day, my friend came up to me and told me he was high, and i asked him to describe it.  He told me that things seemed to go very slow, and different things seemed a lot more alarming.  I just passed it off and though nothing of it.
