I was at a friend's house, and we were just talking and having a good time. I suggested we get some weed, so I sprung for a dimebag. The room was lit only with a blacklight and the glow of the TV. I smoked a lot, I would guess about seven hits. I got up off the couch and I felt like I was swimming. I could barely walk. After that, things get hazy, but I left the apartment and went down to mine.
