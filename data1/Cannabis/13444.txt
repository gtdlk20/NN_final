I sat on the couch and turned on the tv.  The transition was amazing.  The very second the picture came on the screen (simpsons), I all of a sudden grasped my sense of time back.  My heart (which seemed to beat very slow before) had all of a sudden seemed 'real-time' which was actually quite fast.  It was very intersting how my perception of everything changed with the click of a button.
