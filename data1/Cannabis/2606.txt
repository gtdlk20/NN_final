Much of what I think and do while high on marijuana is quite out of character for me.  I undergo what I call a 'mentalmorphosis'; a change very difficult for others to detect, even those very close to me, for it is of purely cerebral nature.  The way in which I convey myself seldom changes even when I am overly intoxicated, yet there are differences in my mannerisms that are so intricate as to only be recognized by myself.  I will show a greater interest in the arts at times, especially music, art, even cooking.  A song will have much more depth, lyrics and instruments tend to embody emotions that can only seem to be derived while high.  The effect of sound and its ability to evoke thought and feeling are heightened.  A good work of art will open itself up when beholded through enlightened eyes; this could be a painting, literature, a movie.  And cooking becomes a journey, a quest motivated by the will to create something worthy of my taste.  My lack of cooking skill does not allow me to develop anything special, but the pleasure of eating while high can make any culinary monstrosity taste exceptional.  The taste sensations experienced under the influence of marijuana are quite astounding to me, I would say that it is the sense most adversely affected.  Deep fried foods release their warm, oily flavors, and their crunchiness is exemplified.  Mashed potatoes have a profound smooth, earthy texture, and meats feel pleasurably moist and firm against the teeth, and the list goes on.  It takes longer for me to finish a meal, simply because flavor sensations become more intense, and I will savor them almost to excess.  I remember consuming a bowl of popcorn one night, one kernel after another, tasting each one individually, because that was all that was necessary.
