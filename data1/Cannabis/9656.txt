I actually remember very little from this session. Overall, it was much closer to an episode with tryptamines (with their parallel lines of thought) than with lysergamides (with their immersive, spontaneous imagery). There are no visuals to speak of but tactile hallucinations are rampant. The feeling is like a fuzzy corona enveloping different parts of my body, but at other times I dissociate and can feel very little. Early on, I have a disconcerting feeling of motion that makes me nauseous, but I quickly regain control. For the rest of the session, I drift back through a line of nostalgic images which quickly swirl into an indistinct smudge of memory.
