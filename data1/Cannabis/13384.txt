Nat, however, was visibly shaken and looked up.  I could see her heart racing in the hollow of her neck and could tell that she was worried by it.  When asked what was wrong, she said that she felt sick to her stomach.  I turned to talk to my brother and I felt a jab in my ribs.  Nat had fallen onto the bed and her elbow was poking me pretty hard.  'That kinda hurts,' I said, and she mumbled an apology and stared off with a glazed look in her eye.  She made a face as though she would vomit, so I sat her up and she protested mildly that she didn't want to hurt me.  I was worried that she was going to have a bad time so I tried to rub her shoulders and give her a kiss, but she turned away and declined.
