The next thing that happened was me waking up suddenly, I semi remember that I was having a nightmare and I forced my way out of it.  I was up, and decided to put the radio on.  But something didn't seem quite right.  Something was different.  I couldn't figure it out, but hmm this seems familiar...then I remembered eating the cookiegravel.  Yes know I know what's wrong- I am unbelievably high!  I was actually beginning to get that feeling where your perception is like a drowning person and normality, or the surface of the water, is just out of reach.  And I was definitely reaching out for it - I was beginning to dissociate slightly.  I looked at the clock- it was 8:45.  It had only been 45 minutes since I had munched; my general experience with eating marijuana is that I reach a peak 3 or 4 hours after I ingest it.  I did the math and started to get a little concerned.  My first reaction was to make myself puke to purge what remained in my stomach.  That didn't really help me out- marijuana is an anti-emetic, and I shit you not when I say I was fingering the lining of my food tube and getting zero results.  This failure only worked to make the situation feel more out of control.  I was not happy- I had ingested a quite possibly heroic dose of THC on an empty stomach and come to the experience directly out of unconsciousness with zero transition.
