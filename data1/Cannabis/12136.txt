Okay this is a good one. I used to smoke alot, it was summer, there was nothing to do, so my friend and I took up smoking. Well after a few months of smoking every weekend and some weekdays we tried something new. We wanted to get as messed up as we ever had in our entire lives so we each bought a quarter and rolled 3 joints. We went out in his back yard at around 11 PM, each with our own joint. We finished with that bout 15 min. later. We then went inside to watch TV. About 10 min. after we smoked, we started feeling moderately high, so we broke out the third joint and shared it. After the third joint we were stoned, very stoned.
