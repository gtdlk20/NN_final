At this point I was cold and wanted back in the club. I go up to the bouncers and they say, You are too intoxicated to enter. I say in disbelief, Wow, what is going on here? This has never happened to me, I have my ticket right here, see my stamp? I hold out my hand. We dont care. Then he takes a black marker and draws two large Xs on the tops of my hands. I try to enter anyway and two men PUSH me back out.
