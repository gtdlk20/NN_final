Fortunately, the high was rather smooth, and not at all uncomfortable, but there were some strange side-effects that went along with it.  My bro got some serious munchies as a result of the stuff, and ate a whole jar of peanut butter.  I on the other hand had a single bite of chocolate cake, followed by the sensation that my mouth was 'glued shut' (BTW, the cake was REALLY GOOD!) the strange part is that my mouth was actually wide open, and my face was completely paralyzed. I found that I could neither move my jaw, nor feel anything touching my face during this time (an hour or two after smoking up).  I also felt very much disconnected from my hands, and motor dexterity in my fingers became sluggish, and delayed almost to the point of uselessness. these effects took about 3 hours to subside, and the next morning, I still felt somewhat stoned.   I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else.
