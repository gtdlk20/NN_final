As I walked back down the dirt road that went near my house, the sun setting behind the mesa created a gorgeous mix of red, purple and orange, whose richness I found to be very peaceful. I reflected on the myriad beauty of nature. The small desert plants all around seemed more alive than I had noticed before, and I could hear dogs barking in the distance. I stretched and moved my body in various directions, marveling at the complexity of the human body. To think that mere electrical impulses from the brain could dictate the actions of this vessel! I began to think of the soul, how we fit in with the 'cosmic scheme of things.' I contemplated God, who could surely not be a physical entity. If so, s/he/it would be bound by some laws and forces. I thought of what we know as God to be some universal concentration of incomprehensible energy, directing all things from the scurrying of an ant to the slow, majestic wheeling of galaxies. My body was crude and puny in comparison, relying on material sustenance and physical manifestation. The thought kept recurring through my head 'We Are Machines Compared To God,' as if our idea of 'Organic' pales in comparison to the raw life-essence that is God.
