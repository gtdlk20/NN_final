In all of my experiences with multiple substances, I have never felt so 'right' as I did that night. I have never felt so 'right' as I did that night. I called members of my family, telling them of my revelation, of my new insight, and every one of them has helped me in working towards this goal, which is still a long way off. Through cannabis induced rants, silly ideas, a completely irrational fear of Zerglings, and all other foolish, but fun, things associated with my cannabis experiences, 'weed' really helped me. I am happier now than I have been in some time, even with the constant stress around me. I know that, due to a simple little plant and a movie, life will be completely worth all the hardship just to pass on any knowledge I am able, to hopefully better our so often ignorant species.
