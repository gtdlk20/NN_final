I began to notice that If I saw something which prompted me to remember how fucked up I was, be it how my arms looked or how intersting a nacho chip was, I would feel another rush of body energy. It was like the weed was rewarding me with this feeling for embracing what it had done to my mind. This was a very pleasant sensation I thought as I sat, slumped and glazed eyed on my couch. This is were I spent most of my night, I mean, I couldn't really think about doing anything else, let alone expending energy on something frivolus like moving around.
