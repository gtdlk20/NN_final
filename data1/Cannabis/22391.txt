The cold dew was better, but still didn't taste that great. I sat back down at the computer and my friend said 'lets go play some starcraft' ... i was quite hesitant at first and told him that it may make me freak out again.. but he was in the mood so i went along with it.  I had an absolute blast. I was laughing my ass off the whole time.. commanding my men to kill eachother and whatnot.  It was such a great feeling knowing that i could put these charachters through hell and nobody would be hurt.  Needless to say we lost the game.  I had told my friend 'i think my high is coming down now'.   He departed and i logged off and went to sleep thinking of all the COMPLETELY different experiences i felt in comparison to when i had ingested shwag.
