My friend, L, had shown interest in hanging out that night. I still had a bit of a cold, so I told him I didnt want to smoke. I asked if he could find some shrooms, knowing that he had the necessary connections. Ive read tripping with just a stuffy nose isnt terrible, and can sometimes help relieve the symptoms.
