At the time that I write this and the time that I smoked up, Im 2 weeks from my 18th birthday. I weigh 150 pounds, and this is the 4th time Ive been stoned. First, an introduction. I was raised in a typical suburban environment; I hear many unspoken messages implying that drugs are bad. The word bad is vague and weak, which captures the strength and severity of the anti-drug campaign Ive felt. From time to time I see advertisements in magazines implying that smoking marijuana leads to destitution. On tv I see Whats your anti-drug? commercials, which are spaced weeks apart and are shown rarely. Stoners are looked down upon, but mainly for their inaction and general lack of intelligence and motivation, not expressly because they smoke pot.
