He spent a couple weeks in the psych ward and on the whole fucked up his life. Anyone smart would see this as a cue to stop, but the day he was out of the hospital he took to smoking cigarettes again. The first time I saw him once he was out of the hospital, he was drinking. Two days later, he was smoking pot again. He ended up having some fucked up hallucinations due to some medication he was on. He is now back to smoking tons, and I have no doubt that he will kill himself one of these days.
