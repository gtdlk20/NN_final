The next few hours are a blur. It was an intense power high for me where things seemed to be happening at a breakneck speed. I have sketchy memories watching my friend eat the hash, me trying to listen to some music, sinking into his couch like there was an elephant on my chest, trying to make conversation with some other guys who showed up but finding it very hard to express what I felt. In short, it was very like a trip and nothing like a normal high. All the while I was wondering whether this was the THC in the hash or some other stuff I did not know about. The thing that stood out most was the physical sensations pulsating up and down my torso, which I find hard to explain.
