In any event, I feel that what we (or at least I) experienced was real, and am grateful for it, even though I still woke up this morning feeling as though I'd done something wrong (the medical anxiety, or some psychological block, I don't know). That was always the missing link with cannabis- I usually feel like I've misused it, or like I used it selfishly, but this is probably an effect of my own self-analysis and constant strive to do 'the right thing' and be the purist person I can, even though, ironically- I believe that right and wrong is a fallacy, and all things in existence are really just one. Earth being one big ball of matter and complexly-designed life, each grain of sand on the beach taking their own route to the same place.
