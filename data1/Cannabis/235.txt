Finally she admitted to me that she sometimes indulged on weekends and agreed to turn me on. So at last I am able to report on what it's like to get stoned after 25 years of abstinence.  At first I choked.  I'm not accustomed to inhaling hot smoke any more and the first toke was a bit of a shock to my lungs. It didn't taste quite the way I recalled. Of course now that I think about it, there was a lot of variety in the taste of pot back then too and I guess I just had this rosy memory of the very best flavor.  I didn't feel stoned immediately and I wanted to keep smoking even though my friend only took a couple of hits and said she'd had enough.  Silly me.  I smoked approximately 1/3 of a joint of a homegrown sinsimilla that was yellowish green color, sticky with resin.
