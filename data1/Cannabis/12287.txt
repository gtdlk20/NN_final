A month later I tried one in a very social setting.  I could feel the panic rising but managed to keep myself distracted enough to maintain composure.  How unenjoyable it is to go 'under the influence', and then not be able to wait for it to end.  A week ago I did the tiniest hit you could imagine.  Jerry Garcia would be laughing at me.  Sure enough, here come the panics again but at an extremely subdued level.
