I laid on the sofa and listened to Vivaldi's four seasons. I couldn't believe how the music was filling my head and running down to my toes. My head was filled with images wrought by the music. I was in a garden filled with flowers of every colour. I was there reaching out to them, in the bright sun, marvelling at the green grass. I wanted to stay in the garden forever. I felt so relaxed, so peaceful. There was nothing else. No everyday worries. I looked at myself out of the garden. I laughed at me, laying there on the sofa.
