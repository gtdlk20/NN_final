10.05 - After a significantly long Diablo II session, I now feel relaxed and tingly all over, and desire sleep deeply. Time seems to move very slowly, reggae music is highly stimulating, and all colour is bright and wavy. That is the only word I can come up with to describe it. I feel gentle and very sincerely nature-acclimated once again. I feel accomplished.
