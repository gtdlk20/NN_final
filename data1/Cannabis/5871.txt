After researching about the substance and talking to my boyfriend about it, I decided that I wanted to try it out with him. He's a usual smoker so this would be nothing new for him. I smoked for the first time a couple of months ago - I took in decent hits, but absolutely nothing happened. I smoked a few other times with friends at night at a golf course and still the cannabis did not affect me. In fact I smoked at least six times before actually getting high. My boyfriend and I discussed why perhaps I wasn't getting high and we came to the conclusion that perhaps I just was not comfortable. So he did everything he could to make sure I was comfortable and it finally worked. I just needed to relax in order to appreciate it.
