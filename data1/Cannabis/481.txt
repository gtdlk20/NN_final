I started talking to somebody else to distract myself from the crazy kids on ecstasy hanging from the ceiling. He was saying something about me having a crazy grin on my face. As I listened to my friend talk, he started to sound further and further away. I could barely hear him at all. It was like trying to listen to him from underwater. His voice sounded muffled and distorted. Everything around me looked and sounded so distant. Then I heard two people talking to each other, although I didn't know who was saying what. Their voices sounded very distant.
