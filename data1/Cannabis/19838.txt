Then there is also a parallel phenomenon  where a thought/intention arises followed by an emotion,  but to the normal mind it appears as one infused with other. We are incapable, therefore, of a pure thought or intention or feeling except under exceptional circumstances. If we were, we would be able to move mountains just with our minds !!  In Star Wars, Yoda tells his young apprentice  to 'Believe' when Luke is unable to lift X-wing out of the Dagobah swamp with his mind.
