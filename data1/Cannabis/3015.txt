I got up feeling sort of weird, really tired and spaced out feeling.  This was about 2 1/2 hours after I had smoked the weed.  I decided to go back to the party, to let them know I was all right, because I had told them I would be coming back.  Then as I was driving, all of a sudden I just started tripping again.  I suddenly became completely disoriented.  I kept thinking I was passing the same spot in the road over and over.  I had no idea where I was.  Then boom, I snapped out of it.  After I got back I was standing around telling some other people about what had happened to me, and all of a sudden I heard rain falling all around me.  I was like 'shit, it's raining!', and everyone just looked at me and said 'That's just someone taking a piss!' (we were in a field).  I swore for all the world I heard rain all around me!  When I drove back about 45 minutes later, I freaked out twice more, I just became totally disoriented, everything looked so confusing, it looked like I was seeing the same thing repeating over and over.  As I drove over the top of a hill, I kept thinking I was about to go off a cliff!  Then I'd just snap out of it as quickly as I'd go into it.  This even happened when I was driving at 4 PM the next day, 18 hours later.  Hasn't happened again since.
