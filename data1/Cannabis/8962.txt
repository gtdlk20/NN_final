The brownie was larger than average and had no distinct weed smell or taste. At home, I ingested half with a full meal and the rest after the meal. (Basically making up my protocol as I went.) About thirty minutes after I began to feel the effects of the brownie. I was in the backseat of my boyfriend's car when I felt as if everything I touched was moving. The fabric of the car felt amazing, like I was experiencing each thread individually. When I closed my eyes, I felt like I was shooting off of the earth into space. I laughed at everything, but could not form a cohesive sentence. It was as if something had taken my voice away. (Like Ariel from the little mermaid.)
