This restless motivation is the primary reward for me, and is an effect I believe diminishes with habitual use, though in the past to combat 'stoner burn out' I have found a cocktail of choline, l-glutamine, and cranberry juice (called fiery wine) to be most helpful. I used liquid forms of both from twin labs in teaspoon quantity 1500-2000+ milligrams of each, and cranberry juice to mask the 'unusual' salty sweet tastes. Spiking this drink with ephedra extract gave it a mild amphetamine effect, superior to caffeine.
