We all started off with tryign the same one because it was rated the better roll. By this time though, pretty much everyone had one of the first, and then had just taken one of the others. Raz and I split ours up. A few of us decided to go back to Raz's place, because Monster needed some sleep and we just wanted to roll. I rode over there with Ox, smoking a cigarette on the way, while listening to the godlike Mr. Bungle. I suppose the half hit me a little as I felt good and the music was excellent. Then, just as the first, the minor feeling was gone. Ox told me he felt the exact same way. We finally went inside and were bitching about the bunk ass pills. By this time it was about 4:15, maybe 4:30, and none of us could sleep. In the house was Sicily and Spin, Ox, BMF, Raz, and Me...the six that took the rolls.
