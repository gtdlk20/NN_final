Breathing is getting easier, or maybe I am getting used to this new task I have to perform. I tend to sit still in one position and not move, more than I usually do, or at least I am more aware of it now. My wrists are glued to the table, but easy to remove if I just focus on doing it. I feel like I am only using my left eye, also the muscles under my right eye are becoming slightly tired.
