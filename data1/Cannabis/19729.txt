I had a strange walk ahead of me, through groves of trees, with a pinprick of light at the end. I couldnt see my feet because of the dark. I usually would have been slightly nervous when sober, but the effects of the weed were just intensifying this. I felt incrediably scared, I was sure the grim reaper was following me. I kept repeating 'its just the drug, home is only a few minutes away', and got out of the first tunnel of trees.
