I then added this, in place of butter, to a batch of 6 large (about 4in dia.) chocolate chip cookies. Let me just say.. one had me stoned out of my gourd. Another half, and I could barely keep my eyes open. Unfortunately, I can't say true dosage, but I'd say an average of about 6.5 ml honey oil per cookie, and I couldn't even guess how long the effects lasted, but it was from about 10 a.m. when we ate the cookies warm from the oven, and I believe I passed out some time around 2 a.m. that night.
