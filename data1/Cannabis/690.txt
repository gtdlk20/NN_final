Then there were the visuals... they were like on the tip of becoming visible, as if my thought were becoming visible.  I was thinking of travelling down my motor neurone pathways at a rapid speed... the neurones themselves were like these intertwined, twirly-weaving tubes that were mutli-coloured but transparent at the same time, and at some points flying along these tubes (I was never actually inside these tubes, unless i was viewing another tube from inside of another tube) I came across multiple T junctions or smaller tubes twisting off at various points in time with the music, there where millions of other tubes like this one in the background.  The most interesting point is that this whole hallucination was coming from my LEFT field of vision, this trip didn't dominate my whole vision (could this be related to my first trip?).  The quality of the 'vision' was like something out of those computer-animated visuals you sometimes get at parties, or if a computer company was showing off its computer capabilities.  Whenever I stopped at a station the music would end, but when the train would start again the music would start.
