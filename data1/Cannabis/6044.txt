I lay down to sleep all my covers on me, I stare at a poster I have on the ceiling it is black and white and crazy like.  IÂ’m staring at this poster and I hear sounds one is like the sound of something when you spin it real fast whoosh whoosh whoosh.  I also feel the presence or know they are coming for me, aliens.  It's like they are going to come out of the poster or the poster is going to suck me up.
