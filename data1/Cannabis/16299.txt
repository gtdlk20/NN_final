I felt as if I was living with insane people and once the effects of Cannabis wear off I will slowly slip back into a similar kind of insanity. A kind of insanity in which you take a 'make believe world' created by the ignorance of your mind as 'reality'. It felt very similar to the concept depicted in the film 'Inception' where they show a group of people asleep and a man in charge of that place tells Leonardo DiCaprio that this is the place where they come to 'wake up' to their 'dream reality'. I felt that I too would wake up to a 'dream reality' once the effects of Cannabis wear off. I felt that I too would wake up to a 'dream reality' once the effects of Cannabis wear off.
