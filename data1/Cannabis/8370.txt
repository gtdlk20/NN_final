My vision isn't fantastic, and weed usually makes it more distorted than usual. But I saw, for a moment, a tree with INTENSE clarity. As I continued walking, the episodes became more and more frequent- I would see the grass or trees with a kind of pure pristine vision, and the color enhancement would be MUCH greater than that of a normal buzz... the greenness of the grass would become so overwhelming and so full of light and life that it was literally blinding. I had a powerful clear feeling during each of these occurences, which faded in and out in rhythm, that I was seeing the real world, as if reality were in a dimension slightly askew from our own and i was being granted the opportunity to gaze into it. The body buzz built, and the electric currents I felt moving through my torso became more powerful, until during each moment of superbright illumination it felt like I was being struck by lightning, and I felt shocks of extremely intense, almost sexual pleasure. (I realize that a near-orgasmic experience on a drug as mild as pot seems extremely bizarre. This was NOT a normal high.)
