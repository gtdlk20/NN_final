Except I didnt seem to fully return to the real world.  I remember someone putting Family Guy on, and sitting while Taya and Tom laughed and chatted.  I was slowly becoming aware of an unintentional detachment from the room.  Try as I might, I couldnt grasp the storyline on Family Guy.  It wasnt that it was moving too fast, I just couldnt connect jokes to punchlines or anything.  This is not an unfamiliar experience, but it felt a little unnerving because I had a small niggling feeling of claustrophobia, and the sensation that the longer I sat there, the deeper I was falling.  Then I felt like I had been quiet for too long and that I should say something to bring me back to reality.
