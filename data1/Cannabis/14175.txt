At Appoximatly 8:30 (t+00.00) we packed a (supposedly) average sized bowl.  I say supposedly because i was the one who packe it, and i didnt put that much in. However, the sample burned FOREVER.  Its a nice change when the bud sticks around for a while rather than going up in smoke so quickly.  There were 5 of us, and the pipe went around about 5 times!!!  about 3 times more than usual.  To re-itterate, this was a pleasant surprise.  Once the bowl was finished (t+.15) we were all quite high,  very happy high too, gigles and smiles all around.
