I had not walked more than 6 meters away when the light headedness began to intensify rapidly, it seemed as though me walking had somehow been to much for me at my present state, yet, I continued to walk down the sidewalk thinking I could beat whatever it was that was happening to me. I walked a few more meters and the ringing in my ears became much louder than when I had heard it before and actually began to drown out every other sound that was going on around me untill just a very loud and high pitched ringing was the only sound in my head. At the very same time the ringing grew, my vision seemed to become affected as well. My vision was slowly fading away as I began to see the sidewalk as though I was looking through a tunnel, a sort of a concave view that was slowly being overwhelmed by the darkness that seemed to come from all around me. Keep in mind that the whole time this was happening only a few seconds had gone by and I was still thinking I could make it down the street to my house which lay in my line of sight. Big mistake. My legs began to become very heavy to where I was stumbling untill the ringing in my ears and my tunnel vision had increased to where all I could see was black, even though my eyes were wide open, and all I could hear was this LOUD ringing.
