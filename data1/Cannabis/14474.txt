As we got into the car, we got into a long conversation on the depth of the seats and how our bodies had 'melted' into them, giving us all an odd unison with the vehicle.   We conversed on subjects ranging from the simplest thoughts to the deepest of emotion, as time became an infinite realm of thought and divine right.  The stars glowed, and the wind brought full body orgasms at the slightest breeze. Vision became like the shot of a 35mm camera, sequences of beauty flashed in my mind and I could relate to my youngest childhood memories once again.  As we exited the car and began to walk up the steep driveway of my friend's house, it began to be a struggle as the floor would convulse and grow beneath us.
