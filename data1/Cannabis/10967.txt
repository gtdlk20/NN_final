Mistake 3: We didnt have a scale accurate in mg, so we just threw the entire thing on a scale and subtracted the bag, just to see how much we had. Seeing as I had never done research on the drug past skimming a wiki page, and L had never measured out his own dose, we were content with the fact that it appeared we had .175 grams of material. We didnt even bother to figure out what that equated to in 7 doses. Not an intelligent thing to do.
