The best trip in my life (no, I've never had a bad trip) happened when my brother's best friend came into town. It was a total shock to him that I had become a total stoner since the last time I had seen him, so as a token of good will (and because he had no way of smuggling that stuff to his new home) he gave me a mini pipe with a built in stash and resin holder (it's an inch long and 4 centimeters thick) and a pipe from Israel. It is by far the most awesome pipe I've ever seen, to this day. To celebrate these new items of mine, we decided to try them out. I smoked a full gram that day. We then went to my room after getting legendarily baked and we went into my room to play Halo. We played it muted, and we listened to every song The Beatles ever wrote. If you think orgasms feel good, you've seen absolutely nothing. Years of pain and depression all seemed to be forgiven when I realized that the world was fucking awesome and not only did all my troubles fade away, but every emotional scar I had received over the course of my life was removed, of course my mind showcased that moment to me during the best riff known to man. (When I'm 64 by the Beatles, the part where Paul goes, 'You'll be older too' is by far the most amazing thing that has ever been recorded in the history of music.) That 3 hour period will forever be known as the best moment in my life never to be topped and forever to be held up high as the meaning of existence and the sole reason life's worth living to the very last second.
