I wanted to go outside and experience everything I could in my altered state. I convinced them that we needed to go out on the dock and look at the stars.

The friend and I stayed on the top part while my girlfriend and T. went to the floating part to sit. The friend & I had deep conversations about whatever the winds of the universe blew in our direction.
