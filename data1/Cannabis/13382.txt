Around this time we stopped smoking, and I was really coming up fast.  Nat asked if Jess was high, because she felt self-conscious that she was the only one.  Nat takes insulin for diabetes, and also is on medication for her thyroid.  As I said, the weed was very physical and I felt increased sensation in my arms and chest, and knew my heart was pounding.  My twin and I were accustomed to weed of this kind and we weren't bothered by it, and knew it would pass; we were still having fun.  Jess seemed to be fairly into her high, but she seemed to be having fun also.
