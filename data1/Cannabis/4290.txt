	Overall I had an amazing first breakthrough experience.  I would not recommend it to those who do not like overly-intense experiences, because I do not believe there is a way to enjoy it without it being overly-intense.  I also advise any user to be careful, because I feel as though there is not much of a way to feel DMT without feeling either intense terror or intense love.  I am grateful that I only experienced less than a second of intense terror, and the upside of ten minutes feeling intense love.
