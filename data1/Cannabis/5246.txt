Well this time was very different. The pure form of euphoria, un-adulerated and clean. My mind-set was very neutral. I was at my house alone since my parents and siblings vacationed to Mexico for 2 weeks, leaving me paranoia free. The setting was very calm, no body home, no nosy neighbors-nothing to get me paranoid. I decided to pick a very calming and soothing tune, 'The Flower Duet by Lakme'. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a hip-hop guy, this is the only opera song I will listen to. Now for the experience.
