Looking for something a little different, i decided i would make herb cookies since i hadn't done that in a while.  i ordered a bag of delivery-service regular grade mediocre cooking herb and poured it into a half-stick of butter or so in a pan.  After cooking that for a half hour, i poured it directly into the cookie batter and made 2 really big cookies (1 for me, 1 for my friend Brian).
