The first time I smoked I didn't feel anything. I can always remember what happens when I smoke. I never lose memory. Maybe time but never memory. My boyfriend showed it to me when I was in college. I was never pressured into it, I was always offered as something polite but was never chastised for declining. After a few times I let my body start slipping into what I guess I call high space. I love being outside when I'm high, the stars seems so much brighter, better somehow. I love to get lost in them. Music changes my high, it shakes my body and makes me smile a lot. When I am high I am not paranoid, scared, nor do I freak out. I smile a ton! I laugh, I can dance, and drive. The great part about my being high is the calm I feel. I also love the body tingle I get. Small movements feel like a wave of motion, it's really quite amazing. Being high is definitely better with friends, even if they don't smoke with you. Its nice to be around people.
