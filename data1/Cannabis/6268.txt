After about five minutes I began coming up very quickly, so fast, in fact, it was uncomfortable. I had been watching videos on my laptop so I continued to do so. After about 10 minutes I began to feel really tense (no doubt my anxiety kicking in) as my heart rate sped up. I made sure I kept myself breathing normally, I know a lot of bad things can happen when one overlooks these things. My chest felt very hot (my lungs reacting to the smoke, if I had to guess), and it felt as though my heart was beating very fast. I checked my pulse, normal except I could feel my heart thumping just a bit more than normal. No big deal. However, soon my pulse sped up a bit and I began shaking. It felt as though my muscles in my legs tensed up and then became relaxed, very quickly. Soon, I began loosing my concept of time. What was really 8 minutes dragged on for what I honestly believed was half of a hour. At this point I was sitting in my room watching 44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Bank Shoot-Out. It was during the process of watching this movie I hit the very peak of my high.
