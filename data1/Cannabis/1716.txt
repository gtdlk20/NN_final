I went out into my garden, taking along with me my iPod and my bong as well as my stash and a lighter, finding a nice little tree stump near the back of my garden where I would not be seen from the house (the garden stretches back a good distance and curves round slightly) back here at this time of the year its mushroom kingdom. I'm not well versed enough in mycology yet to pick shroomies... even though there are many mushrooms I suspect to be cyanescens and semilanceata I'd rather not risk it.
