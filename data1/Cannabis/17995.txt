Then we realized that we had a huka party poster that reacted to a black light that we haven't even looked at yet. So we turned on my blacklight and I looked at the poster and listened to the music again. I was laying on my friends floor staring at the poster when all of the sudden there were 4 mushrooms in the corner that started moving in a circle, and all of the sudden I was sitting in this park and all these kids were yelling and I couldn't figure out what was going on. But luckily then I realized I didnÂ’t like this and it was the song doing this to me so I jumped up and switched the song.
