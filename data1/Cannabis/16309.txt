It dawned on me that the above saying was not to be taken literally. Under Cannabis, I become receptive to 'higher truths' and insights and this higher/divine knowledge is the Guru or the Master that comes when one is ready. The Master may not necessarily be a person. One becomes one's own master/guru in a 'high' state. Evil is not an external entity, it is one's own ignorance. The message of the Sufis came to my mind - 'you stand between yourself and God'. Here God means enlightenment, you imply your ignorance. The words and spiritual compositions of great seers and sages were written in a similar state of high which they achieved through non-chemical means. Taking of such psychotropic plants is perhaps a short-cut, and that is the reason why its effects are short-lived.
