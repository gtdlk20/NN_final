This is the most powerful emotional experience of my life. It's really personal, I haven't told it to any of my close friends. It felt as if I was touched by god, but I'm leaning towards that it was not god (I'm an atheist), but that, through the cannabis, I got a powerful channel to my subconcious, communicating with it and trying together to solve the problem between us. But, IÂ´m not sure.
