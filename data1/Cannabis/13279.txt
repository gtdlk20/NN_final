Half-way up the hill I feel my legs burning, like they are about to fall off. I try to just ignore it and keep walking. suddenly I am locked in a repeating motion, over and over againleft foot forward, right foot forward, arms swing, cant stop, im going too fast now The feeling of helplessness grows; I can do nothing but walk, faster and fasterI never slow down, I couldnt if I wanted toI cant feel my legs anymore, but I can feel my feetwhere did the ground go? Im floating now, nothing around me.
