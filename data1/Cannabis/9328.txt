7:45 I'd woke up several times without remembering falling asleep. I didn't think I could fight it anymore. I resigned myself to the fact I was going to fall asleep, and maybe or maybe not wake up. I set an alarm for 45 minutes. My boyfriend wouldn't be home yet for another hour and a half and I desperately wanted this to end before he got home. I got up and went to the bathroom. It felt like I was in there for an hour. I kept forgetting what I was doing as I was doing it. I came out expecting it to be 10 but it was only 7:58.
