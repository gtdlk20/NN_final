I smoked a joint outside with J. that night (Im still not sure if Ive got the knack for sucking in that smoke, but I did cough once, I think that means Im on the right track). Being as I was already fucked up, Im unsure how much it really affected me, but I seemed to lose my newfound lucidity a few minutes later and turn back into a rambling imbecile with poor motor control.
