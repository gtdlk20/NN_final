We eventually gave up, deciding that there were no cows after all and met in the center of the field.  We were all so overcome with our highs that we laid down together to watch the sky.  I can only describe it as complete and total peace and zen.  I laid in the soft grass, surrounded by pitch blackness.  I could hear the breathing of my friends, and the occasional wonder filled murmer.
