The effects of the pot and a dream-like state lasted for a period of almost 24 hours. I can't even begin to explain the time lapses, but from every moment from the next, it felt as if I was placed in the moment, not knowing how or when I got there, or even being able to understand the concept of time, or even that of a 'future,' nevermind the familarity of 'myself.' I learned a lot and I am amazed with how my mind can alter time and memory to such an extent. Nevertheless, it was quite amazing.
