But then my high became adverse. My body was disassociating. Music was coming out of the ambient white noise. I asked my friends, 'do you hear that beautiful music?' Negative. I was alone. Then the waves of evil started lapping at my feet. The 2 aquaintances took on a new persona. I took on a strange delirium. I believed that the man was satan, and his female roomate was his succubi. Caught in this thought loop, my body would revolt each time I thought about the satan connection. In a sick way, I was really enjoying these stream of evil thoughts, however my body was revolting.
