The first time I ever smoke weed I was when I was 15.  I was going to be home alone for about an hour, so I decided to take my ounce and brand new bong out for a test run.  I loaded a heavy bowl, smoked, and felt nothing.  But I was determined.  I smoked another bowl, and thought I wasn't high, but then stood up off my patio chair, and immediately plopped back down again.  The whole backyard swirled and I realized how much had smoked.  I walked back inside just as my parents pulled up the driveway, so I hid the bong and the rest of my stash in my room, and collected myself enough to go get a snack and BIG glass of cold water.  All I wanted was some water and chocolate chip cookies.
