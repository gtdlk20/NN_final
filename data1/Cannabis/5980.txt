Now, I do this a lot. When I am with people doing other things beside chiefing, I get glimpses of what they are experiencing, and it is something more than the visual aspects (even though the visuals are extreme and are there). I can travel into their world, their complex world. No, I can travel into their complex universe, where there they behold marvelous things... I can, when stoned, put my hands out as if I am playing a computer game, except with a complex keyboard with multiple dimensions and codes with complexities of nothing that can ever be imagined to be fathomed. I can see into my past. I can see things in my past that I have long forgotten. Things that seem unreal, yet are entirely real can be too real to me (if you can understand where I am coming from). I can become in the presence of God, and feel his warm smile upon me... I can be anything...
