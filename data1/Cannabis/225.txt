Well first of all I suppose I should explain why the 25 year gap.  It seems that in my late twenties, I became a little too fond of alcohol.  It was messing up my life.  I was not in control and I experienced several blackouts which I was very disturbed by.  So when it was suggested to me that my problem was that I had become an alcoholic, I reluctantly decided that I had to investigate.  In 1982 I stopped drinking for about 7 months and attended numerous AA meetings.  I kept looking for someone to tell me that I was not an alcoholic.  I was looking in the wrong place.
