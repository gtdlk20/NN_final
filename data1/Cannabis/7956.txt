This went on for a decent 15 minutes or so. Suddenly, a change in pattern. On the screen appeared myself. Not a 3 year old or long forgotten form of myself, but me exactly how I was at that moment, lying on my living room floor. My eyes were closed, arms and hair sprawled out. After about 10 seconds, the black frame faded and disappeared. There I was, about two feet away and two feet off the ground, looking at my body lying helpless on the floor. The sensation was extreme. My mind could sense no physical form of myself. Then again, if I did have a body, I would be halfway thru the floor. I began to look at myself. I imagined the warmth and comfort my body was feeling, but shuddered at the cold I felt several feet away. I looked up at my two friends on the couch, chatting away. They had no idea I had left. They were happy and high in their bodies, oblivious to my state. If only they knew... they would miss me. They need me.
