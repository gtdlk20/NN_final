The high wore off nearly completely after the show. I got ready for bed, and then slept perfectly, getting to bed at 10:40 pm, when my goal had been 11. When I woke up this morning, I felt radiant. I have certainly never been so high in my life, and though I would hate to be that high every time I smoke, IÂ’m still really glad I experienced it. I might like to again at some point, under better circumstances. I think the weed gods may have been making up for my unimpressive first time.
