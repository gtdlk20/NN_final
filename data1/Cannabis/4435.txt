We reached the park and sat down in a pavilion. By now it was so dark that you couldnt see 200 feet in front of you (in the forest). We sat down. We began contemplating our next move. C lived far away, so me and Ns houses were the closest. N contended that he had too many people at his house and his room doesnt provide much privacy (his room doesnt even have a door). My whole family (both my parents and sister) were home at my house, AND my house was further away than Ns, but not really that much. I had a room that had a tv, a Nintendo set, and a door. The tv and Nintendo set would give us a reason why us three were hanging out in my room, and the door would provide us with privacy (so we could talk about our states of being when it was closed).
