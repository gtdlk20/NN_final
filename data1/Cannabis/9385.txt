I bought these high CBD flowers from a vape shop as I gave up smoking regular cannabis a year ago after 14 years of smoking 3grams of top shelf weed from waking up to going to bed everyday. My body one day decided anough is anough and THC made me anxious paranoid and made me feel I was having a stroke or a heart attack every time I smoked.
