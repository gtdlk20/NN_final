Several minutes later I decided to go back to my dorm. Mario offered me a ride, my first instinct was to say 'No you idiot, you're high!'. Somehow I ended up in the back of his Isuzu Trooper II with one of my good friends, L. I totally forgot that she was the one who introduced me to Mario, and the reason she hasn't been mentioned up to this point is because I have no recollection of her being with me at the party. I remember the ride as the most terrifying experience of my life, not because of the drive itself, but because L kept poking me in the stomach, being a ticklish person normally, combined with the turns of the car which I perceived as violent fish tailing and swerves, it was a horrible experience. All I wanted to do was get out of the car, and at one point I tried to open the door and bail out, but being a dumb stoner I couldn't figure out the lock.
