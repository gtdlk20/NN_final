To tie this messy conglomeration of psychedelic ramblings up, I hope this was helpful to anyone searching for a decent description of how oneÂ’s first psychedelic ordeal may feel.  Although I cannot claim to have fully illustrated a psychedelic experience in any way, I hope to at least have provided a vague outline.  Those reading this may argue that marijuana does just make users lazy and stoned, that I am exaggerating its psychedelic effects.  All I can say to those people is that they may be right; I claim not to have written of the average encounter with marijuana but solely of my own, personal experiences.
