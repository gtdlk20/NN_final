I consider myself a experienced pot smoker even though I am just in high school, but this trip rocked my socks off. I am starting by telling you my usual preparations which I always do including this time. When I smoke pot it is after school most of the time so I drive home, go upstairs, get into my stash get what I need then head to the bathroom. I almost always roll my joints on the crapper while I crap. I find it very relaxing and I enjoy it. This time was slighty different, I rolled me a great joint, it was fairly large and I was proud and happy, like always after I roll a joint. I had some left over on my yearbook that I use to roll on and I was trying to put it back into the bag but the book slipped off my knee and a fair amout of weed (about enough for a pen sized joint) fell into the toilet. That tore me up bad but I knew it wasnt worth going in after so I was just really pissed at myself, but I lit my joint and burned it and then went into my room and flipped on the television, King of the Hill was on and me being I big fan of Mike Judge I always watch this show when I get home.
