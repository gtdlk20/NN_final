After we returned home to my place, the effects were still strong, but beginning to wear off. I was very hungry and ate upon instinct. I couldn't control my body. I ate some cereal, and my body moved the spoon to my mouth with no thought involved. My brain was forcing me to do things. Half of the milk that went into my mouth ended up on the table or floor from my unintentional drooling habits (only because I was high).
