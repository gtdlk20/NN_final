As a kid and a pre-teen, and even during my early teenage years, I was highly creative, curious about the world, happy to hang out with friends, etc, but around age 15, for reasons I haven't fully figured out (extreme sleep deprivation may have played a part) my mind effectively shut down, I felt like I'd been lobotomized.  I was unable to write, which was my main creative outlet, or enjoy the things I read, as I no longer imagined or saw anything but ink on paper.  My friendships mostly evaporated; I was suicidal.  That was about 4 years ago and I'm no longer depressed.  I'm beginning to have a social life again.  But the workings of my mind still feel incredibly boring; my introspection from day to day is exactly the same; there's no imagination or daydreaming, just the physical world.
