Pink Floyd plays on. I hear a strange phrase sung, no doubt distorted by my stoned state. 'Trimatized to the groun'. I write down the phrase and suddenly, I SEE it - as a COASTLINE. The synesthesia is revealing a depth to the phrase and infusing each word with a new dimension. The coastline is the nuanced visual result (or painting) of each word blending into the others - a synesthesia of meaning. If I was more capable of articulating my revelations, I'd describe it as the 'essence of information'. Maybe even the 'essence of understanding'. A new visual language, one I'd call: Indiskri babble.
