They started driving to somewhere; I do not recall where.  Every turn was an ordeal.  I did not want to lean with the turns but I also didnÂ’t want to take the effort it required to prevent leaning.  They stopped at a gas station to get some smokes and I asked the person going in if he could get me something to drink because I was obviously not coherent enough to get up and do it myself.  The next hour, or what seemed like it, was mostly spent concentrating on rhythmically drinking my 7up.  I heard them mention my name once or twice but I could not interject myself into the conversation to ascertain what they were talking about.
