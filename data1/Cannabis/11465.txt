I was about eighteen at the time, and my friend had invited me to smoke up with her and a couple of her friends.  I agreed wholheartledy, seeing that I had smoked a few times before and had some generally good experiences. The person I was with had only smoked one other time before, so naturally she was a bit anxious.  I told her it would be alright, even though I was not too familiar with her friends or the person she had gotten her stuff from. (Always make sure you know the person you get your stuff from, I cannot stress that enough!)
