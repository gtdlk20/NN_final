I felt so much more open, I talked to several of my friends that night, telling them how appreciative I was of their friendships.  I realized I donÂ’t call my friends enough, and that the only thing keeping me from being more social was me.  I now saw depression as truly being all in my head.  And I truly had the power to change the way I think.
