Report: I purchased a 1/8th of CBD flower from a headshop in my town. The area that I live in still seems marijuana illegal both recreationally and medicinally. But CBD products are allowed. The box stated that it contained 0.03 percent THC and 476 mg of CBD. Upon inspection the flower looked identical to high grade cannabis and smelt skunky but the smell did not fill up the room as normal bud would. I could also see crystals and the bud was very sticky. I decided to use a gravity bong as in my experience it provides the strongest high for me. I smoked 10 gravity bongs which equaled to over a gram of the CBD flower. As I was pulling the GBs I noticed I was getting higher and higher after the 6th one or so. After the 10th I was definitely high. My eyes were reddened and glassy and it felt as if I had smoked 2 or 3 GBs of some mids. I was shocked that I could buy this legally in my highly illegal state much less get high off of it. It was definitely a THC high that lasted around 4 hours. It was definitely a THC high that lasted around 4 hours. After I had sobered up I had a splitting headache (which could be due to the GBs, they always have given me headaches). The next morning I gave myself a at home drug test that exclusively tests for THC and I failed it miserably. I tested myself 3 days later and I was clean.
