'Achieving success is easy.  Success is seen, visualized, and a desire for success is instilled in the mind.  After seeing success, one yearns for it, and will mentally prepare themself to do whatever it takes to achieve it.  This is how I feel, and I don't know if others feel the same way.  I feel that there is nothing I can't do, realistically, or unrealistically, and some people can't handle that.  I'm stupid in a sense, because I'm young, and I still go out doing stupid things.  I'm the punk kid who broke your mailbox.  I picture you going to get your paper in your robe and seeing your mailbox laying on the ground.  You begin cussing and this ruins your entire day, and after momentary guilt, I never think of it again, and I don't hesitate to break another one, or do anything else.  You curse whoever did this to your precious mailbox, and hope that something equally as terrible or worse will happen to me.  Maybe one day I'll go out to get my paper and see my mailbox broken, or maybe I'll go get my newspaper and someone will put a bullet in my head.  But life is like a ladder, you can't let anything unimportant like your precious trinkets get in the way, because you have to climb to the top.  This is how success is achieved.'
