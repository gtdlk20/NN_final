When I had my eyes open, the entire room was spinning and twirling. Whenever I closed them, I got the strangest sensation that I was rolling foward, off my bed, even though I wasn't. I couldn't move the slightest bit or I was hit with extreme nausea. I couldn't even throw up because I hadn't eaten anything for a while. There were times I felt that the piece of my bed that I was lying on was hovering midair somewhere and things were flying around me. And I was overheated like crazy.
