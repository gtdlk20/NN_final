My parents began talking to each other, and I couldnÂ’t make anything out of what they were saying. Every word they said seemed random, and weird plotlines relating to their words appeared in my head. I realized that the weed had made their conversation incomprehensible, so I ignored it and walked carefully back up the stairs. Having reached my room I turned on my laptop and watched a dvd. It was hard to follow what was happening, and harder to piece different scenes together until they were understandable, but I understood the movie and remembered it pretty well.
