When I'd bored of watching porn, I tried to close my eyes, only to again feel dizzy like I was going to throw up, so I immediately opened them and felt fine. At this point, I was feeling super annoyed. I just wanted to go to sleep, but I couldn't. I wondered how long it would last, and decided I didn't really know when I had vaped. I took out my phone, guessed it was about 30 minutes ago, and started a stopwatch to track the time. I just had to wait out 1-2 hours and it would go away.
