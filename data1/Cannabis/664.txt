NOTE: The main reason I have decided to post this relatively mild cannabis 'trip' (I will use the term trip very loosely in this report, in the first two trips they are more feelings and sensations than actual visuals, but in the 3rd and 4th I would classify them as mild tripping, as there is some distortion and vague formations) and not my Acid experiences is that my Acid experiences are not as meaningful; all I seemed to get was interlocking geometric patterns in time with the enhanced music, with a large euphoric feeling (basic standard stuff really).  However from my Cannabis 'trip' I felt something really deeply, and I can remember what I was thinking, not just what I was seeing, unlike Acid.
