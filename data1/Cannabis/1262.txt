15:45 Might still be building! Quite facinating so far. Relaxing but powerful psychedelia, deeper & stronger than Al-Lad, so far. Much slower aproach from LSZ than from Al-Lad is noted. This is without question quantifiably different to Al-Lad, as unique as all these remarkable compounds tend to be! I am certain that with little more than one or two more goes on this stuff I would be able to tell it apart from damn near any other psychedelic drug I've ever tried. I've had scorn poured quite recently on my ascertion that even after decades (my last dose of LSD was summer 1996! & yes, I remember EXACTLY what LSD is like, you don't trip 30 or 40 times & f*cking forget what LSD is like, ever!) I can tell the difference between Al-Lad & LSD itself. I stand by that!
