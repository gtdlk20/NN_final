I awoke the next morning, covered in flour. What had happened!? I was laying in a pile of the white flour. It was in my ear, in my long hair, and in my eyes. I couldn't believe it, I didn't even know this had been done to me. My friends had thrown 3 hand fulls of flour at 'rapid speeds' as my friend explained at my head, smacking with loud flesh like sounds each time, and I didn't even budge, so they left me alone. I went to the bathroom and took a shower. I felt clean and renewed. I was hung over, nothing noticable though. I just felt tired, run down. This passed after eating breakfast.
