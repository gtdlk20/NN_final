The whole thing started as I walked into a dorm room where five or six people were already good and stoned.  One guy, Rick, had just finished rolling a very big joint of what I assumed was the same weed that the rest of the people in the room had just smoked.  IÂ’m normally not a big smoker but I was a little irritated at being the only sober person in the immediate vicinity so when Rick asked if anyone wanted to share the joint I said I would take a hit or two.  Rick, one other guy, Mike, and I walked outside into a little courtyard that was surrounded on three sides by the walls of the dorm.  They lit up the joint and we started passing it around.  I wound up taking three hits, the third one really against my better judgment, as I tend to have a very low tolerance for weed.
