I never reacted that way on weed before, and I've gotten so stoned in my days that all I could was sit there and try not to look like I was passing out. I think the reason I had a bad trip like that is because ever since my best friend moved away I haven't enjoyed any high. Me and him, we were best buds, we got high for the first time together, and we never smoked with anyone else. We were pretty close and ever since he left all my drug experiences have not been that good. I didn't actually not enjoy the trip, I was just scared. It was like a roller coaster, its scary, but fun.
