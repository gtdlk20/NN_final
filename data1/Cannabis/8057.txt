I believe it was another half hour later that it hit me. I was downloading MP3s for J. on her computer (tracks from the soundtrack to Diva) when I started to notice the familiar effects: light headedness, warmth, a definite buzzing sensation (I finally understood what a buzz was!). But this time there was no panic, head rush, or sense of immanent passing out. I suspect that the dramatic reaction which signaled the onset of my first trip was fueled by anxiety at the novelty of it all  figures. I was now somewhat accustomed to the physical sensations, and able to roll with them. Soon after the effects began, J.s kids came home from school and the place became a little hectic, but I was left alone most of the time in the computer room.
