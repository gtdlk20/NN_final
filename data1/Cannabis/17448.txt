This is when the trip really escalated. I was sitting in bed, my mind was becoming delusionally paranoid, I was fearing my parents might walk in and see me in this state. I felt my heart rate was probably something in between 150-200 bpm, and I was worried. My body was completely shaking, I could feel the bed vibrating because of it. The probably only positive (ish) thing that happened on the trip were the hallucinations. With my eyes closed, the hallucinations were vivid and memorable. At one point, I remember seeing a green circle surrounded by darkness which had a thick diameter of some sort of ancient looking design within its diameter. The circle had distinct symbolic figures lying on points all around it, and was fulling rotating. Then, as the hallucination became more and more vivid, its reality slowly overpowering my perception, I had to open my eyes. When I did this, the darkness of my eyes closed which surrounded the circle was replaced with the darkness of the room, though I could see the rest of my room in this darkness. The hallucination continued vividly as ever.
