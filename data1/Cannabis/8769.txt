Entering Room B, to my surprise, I found my roomie, spaced out, with another person. One by one, we started taking hits from an improvised bong. I took multiple hits, thinking that I wouldn't get high unless I consumed the most I could. I started to feel nauseated. I waited for 5-10 minutes. Everything felt wobbly, like waves, subtly swaying and making my body resonate. My vision was ever so slightly warping and I felt giddy, and safety was in being seated. When the nausea was back to being bearable, I took a few more hits from the improvised bong. My memory of what happened thereon is slightly faded.
