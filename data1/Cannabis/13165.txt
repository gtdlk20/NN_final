I'd made a batch of almond and lemon biscuits with a fairly large chunk of hash ground up and chucked in (about a tenner's worth in the UK). I had so many I froze most and kept one bag in my room. I hadn't gotten the hang of how many I should take for a good experience and was just experimenting with 2, then three... Later that week one evening I took 6 biscuits at about 7pm. As usual I expected a few hours before it kicked in so went to bed. After I'd read a book for about an hour things started to happen and I was feeling great. I was euphoric and my mind felt the size of the world. Then I became very jittery and I fet very very thirsty and dehydrated. I thought I was controlling my heart beat but the horrid thing was that I thought I was slowing it down to the point where I was sure I was going to stop it completely. It was like the plants had taken over my mind and were trying to kill me. I felt like the plants were the gods of the earth and I needed to worship them to stop them from killing me. I could see in my mind towering forests of green staring down at me. My body was felt like it wasn't there, not the nice relaxed muscle feeling but like it'd dissolved.
