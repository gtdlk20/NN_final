Right about here my friend got up and walked past me, and I was brought back to this side of the barrier. I got up to go to the bathroom, and it was as if I was a foot shorter than I really am. I should also mention that I am diabetic, and I got very dehydrated during this experience, I mean I peed like crazy. When I sat back down, I tried explaining what had happened to me to my friend. And as I did, I could close my eyes and see/feel things still going on, the 3-d richness had passed, but my hands seemed to move in the other reality, I could feel it. I remember telling him something about open eye reality, closed eye reality, and how this experience moved beyond closed eye reality. Well it all made sense at the time.
