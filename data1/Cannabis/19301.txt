We sat in the basement for a while and then we had to leave. Cs room was in the basement and her window was level with the ground so for fun we decided to climb out the window to leave. I had a little bit of trouble, but when I got outside I felt awesome. To this day I still enjoy being outside when Im stoned. I feel like I enjoy the natural beauty of the earth more when Im stoned.
