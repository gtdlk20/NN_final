It was around christmas time and I was at a friends birthday party. A buddy of mine had brought over some mildly potent marijuana, and we proceeded to smoke a decent 3-4 grams of it in the form of joints, while we used an old dragon-shaped pipe for the roaches. I have a somewhat high tolerance to weed, so I experienced nothing more than a respectable high after approximately 10 minutes after inhalation.
