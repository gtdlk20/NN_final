Finally wen the concert was over my cousin gave me 20 bucks to get a cd.  But she forgot to tell me where u get them!  So I am still fricking high at this time! And I'm walking around aimlessly asking random peolpe and guards where u get the cd's.  It was pointless, cuz I didnt understand wat any of them said so I just said ok thanks! And asked someone else.  Wen I actually got to the counter I didnt know wut to ask them for. Ii almost accidently bought a shirt.
