I ran up stairs to tell my companions about what had happened.  None of them had gotten the same effects.  Maybe my 'set' had something to do with it.  I have just recently beaten a long time case of depresion and anxiety, and realized that i am the happiest person on this planet.  There is nothing that i cant do if i put my mind to it, and nothing can worry me.  Its a nice mind set to be in...let me tell you.
