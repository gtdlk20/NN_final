I laid down on my bed and put on my headphones and 'Tomorrow Never Knows' by the Beatles. I was instantly tranported into another world. It vaguely felt like India, but like a desert with strange people with weird clothes walking around in the sand. I closed my eyes and let the music talk to me. I could see the face of John Lennon, and he seemed to be telling me what to do. I heard (or felt) a voice say, 'Music is the language of the universe'. I was thrown into deep, reflecting thought. The line of the song, 'Listen to the color of your dreams' had a similer effect.
