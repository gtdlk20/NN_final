We than walked downstairs and sat on chairs in Cs room. All of my other friends were talking with each other while I was sitting in my chair stoned off my ass. During the time I was sitting in my chair I kept feeling like somebody added weights to the front of my body, making it hard to sit up straight. I would fall over and than catch myself and sit up straight and look around the room. The whole time this was going on a felt bloated and close to throwing up.
