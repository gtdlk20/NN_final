This trip was the best I've ever experienced on weed.  It was so intense yet, so relaxing.  It first started when I rode my bike over to my friends house still a little high.  Then we got buzzed at the house and had a cigarette or two.  Then his dealer came over and rolled us a fat joint.  We were so excited that we ran into the garage and got ready to hotbox this small ass little plymouth.  My friend took first hit then me.  9 hit's later I was laughing uncontrollably.  Then we calmed down and hit the bowl in my pipe.  I got three hits and was finally out.  By this time I was very blown and things I've never experienced before started to happen.  I started to see everything in red.  Then I looked at my friend and he look like a rubber tree with moving branches.  I thought the weed might have been laced, so I aksed him and he said no.  So we decided to go back into the house and this is where I started laughing uncontrollably again.  My friends suggested filming me and putting me on Guinness for ''most fucked up''.  But I said I'll pass  After I stopped laughing for like a half hour straight I laid down on the floor and everything just seemed like I was in total paradise.  I felt so free and so connected with myself that I just wanted to explode in joy and happiness.  I started to get hungry so I got some pizza and everyone else got Burger King.  I ate about 4 slices of pizza and then just went into a complete state of oblivion.  I listened to no one.  I was having the time of my life.  I cared about nothing.  I was like this for about 2 hours going in and out of this and other different states. I was too stoned to remember much but all I can tell you is that this was a life changing experience and may be too intense for some.  Overall I had a great time and I'm looking forward to being stoned this much again.
