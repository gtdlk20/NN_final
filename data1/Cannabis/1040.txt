I'm now sitting at my computer typing this, dealing with my 'high over' (the very despondent and surreal feeling I get after I have been high for a while) and considering my evening. My religious views still remain the same, but I definitely understand the need for spirituality. I don't view it as a supernatural concept or a submission to any higher power, but an inner understanding of the importance and awesomeness of reality and existence. I now have an idea of 'God'. It is truly everything. I don't mean this in the animistic sense, I only mean that as opposed to worshiping an unknowable entity as a higher power, I feel a sense of 'worship' toward reality as the only power.
