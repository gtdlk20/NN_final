At 12:27am (until then I didnt think to keep any track of time), I was safe again in my home and I was eating the sandwich. I gulped it down too quickly to enjoy it properly. Everything was safe and good, but when a sudden noise came from the neighboring houses, I was fearful that there were people that could threaten me and also find out. Then I lied again on the couch and put some Bob Marley to relax. However, the effects now werent so strong. For example I wasnt laughing constantly now. Then I got up and tossed away some trash things I didnt need, which I had lying there for an unjustifiably long time. A wooden wine barrel was like it had a face and was staring at me. I didnt hallucinate anything, just I had the mental feeling that it has a face and sees, watches and can talk. I soon felt the effects diminish even more. I was again hungry though, so I got out again. Now I was able to count the money accurately. I went to another store lest I raise suspicion and ordered a hot dog. Thankfully I was coherent. I ate it and then went elsewhere to eat again. I took another road, which was as I like it. Nearly empty of cars or people and calm. I like such conditions at night even when sober, so my happiness wasnt purely due to the effects of the herb. I wondered at the little puddles of water near the sidewalk that shined under the bright white lights. I ordered a small burger, which I quickly ate.
