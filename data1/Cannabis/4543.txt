About a block and a half away from where we started, going to the car to get the munchies, I turned my head back to look at the group and WHAM! It hit me, my vision went into what I called Spontaneous Sensory Lag, everything in my sight when I turned my head went blurry, with very defined horizontal lines, almost like I could see the ground moving opposite my turning head. We reached the car and I could feel my knees tingle, I was overjoyed, my doubts were gone, I was actually getting stoned! However this sudden change of events began to freak me out a little bit.
