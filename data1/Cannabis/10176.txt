When I stood up I felt really dizzy, but I knew this was all in my head and could still walk. I went to my room to lie on my bed away from everyone. As I lied there, the physical sensations got even stronger. It felt like everything was moving (mostly the stuff I was lying on and myself) in a semi circle motion at 4 cycles a second. I tried to ignore it but it would not go away. I was very out of it and just wanted to go to sleep at this point, switching to Boards of Canada to try to zone out enough to drift off didnt help. My mind kept drifting to many different images like those that I said earlier. Eventually I fell asleep although I dont remember, and I did not sleep well.
