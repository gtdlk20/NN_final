We sat in her room chilling, watching tv, surfing the internet, and getting so much uncontrollable laughter, it was so much fun, and incredibly relaxing. I didn't get the munchies at all, and neither did she. I can't remember everything that we found funny, there was just too much of it. However, there was one that I remember very well: at one point, I started concentrating on nothing in particular, and my head started to feel numb-like. I suddenly felt something around my head, and I said 'It feels like there's something on my head.' I reached up, and felt something. I got scared for just a moment, and realized it was my hat. Hilarity ensued, good times were had. Nearing midnight, we started to come down, but we were definitely still high, but more chill. It would come in 10-15 minute waves; nearing baseline, the high would intensify again, and then relax several minutes later, then intensify. It wasn't uncomfortable in any way.
