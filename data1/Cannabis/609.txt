Thinking back to earth life, and remembering how I was always trying to understand what life really was. But I couldnt understand it because I had those blinders on. But now I was back to the place where my soul had initially came from. My soul was continuously moving faster and faster through this new world, uniting with it. Realizing that it had never been separate from this world. The seperateness was just an illusion. This was my true home. As I thought back to that earth existence, I realized that eventually I would have to go back there. Once again, Id have to live another life confused about existence with my blinders on. But it didnt matter, because no matter how long it seemed that I would be in that world, it was really only a tiny amount of time compared to how long Id stay in the ultimate truth once I died again. And then I would come back to my souls true home and reunite with the ultimate. And then I would have to go back to the earth world again. I would be eternally switching back and forth between these two places. I then realized that I always had been switching back and forth between these two worlds since the creation of the universe. I had lived a million lives and would live a million more.
