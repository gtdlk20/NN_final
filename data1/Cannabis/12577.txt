My friend went and got his bong, it was a 600mL glass juice bottle, but made a nice bong. He gave it to me along with a lighter, and taught me how to smoke it. I packed the bowel full, and sucked it all into my lungs. I got a nice lung-full of smoke, a lot more than I could ever handle from a pipe. As I exhaled I coughed a lot, it messed me up. Trying not to let my friend know I was already stoned, I packed another bowl full, bigger than the last one. I sucked it down like the last one, this one messed me up. I coughed and coughed. I had a sip of someoneÂ’s water, just a glass that was left on the table. It felt like it had put a fire out in my throat! I closed my eyes and all I could see was dope leaves with rectangles around them, hundreds of them. They were like bright metallic green.
