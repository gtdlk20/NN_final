Many times I meditate while high because I can focus more without distracting thoughts Many times I meditate while high because I can focus more without distracting thoughts, but this day I decided I was so high, I should probably just enjoy it. All my friends know that with me, I get high very easily, and I have intense highs. For whatever reason, my highs are in my head, body, and eyes at the same time. So when I sit still I shiver and shake and twitch, but also get distorted visuals. Well sitting on the couch I started feeling like the couch was falling backwards all the time, as if I was on a small, but fast ferris wheel going in reverse. I could actually feel the wind against my skin (I later realized this was an exaggeration of the wind from the fan above me). Then I closed my eyes and got some closed eye visuals, which are somewhat consistent with every time I get high. It seems to me that these visuals are of things I saw as an infant. For example, I saw my house, but it was an incredibly simplified version, with only one floor, and only one level of roof which slanted to the back. But it was most definitely my house. I think I was somehow remembering the way I saw or thought of my house when I was just an infant. I also saw a pattern that could either be an eye or a loose outline of a house, but that pattern appears in my head almost every time.
