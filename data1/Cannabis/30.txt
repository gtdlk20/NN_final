Sometimes, when Ive had particularly trippy weed and there are no real distractions around me, I feel like Ive gone up another level altogether, and Im watching my subconscious mind playing with my conscious thoughts while I sit in another cinema in my sub-subconscious.  This sub-sub conscious cinema is very interesting and exciting.  I can introduce a conscious thought, like a picnic in the park, and watch my subconscious flip through files so-to-speak - memories, ideasoften, for some reason, I will see vintage cartoons detailing aspects of the thought.  Cartoons I dont remember seeing in real life, but that my subconscious uses to analyse a thought.  If I try hard enough I can see this happening during the daytime, when not under the influence.  I have come to the conclusion that this is how my brain works.  That makes sense to me, and it seems incredible that I can see these inner workings taking place.
