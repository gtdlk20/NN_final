Again, like the time I swallowed hash and went skiing, it took an hour or so before the effects started to be felt. This time, however, it took longer and longer to really feel what was going on because of the larger amount consumed. It wasn't until well into the flight I not only felt super-stoned, I felt like I had taken a hit of acid! The constant noise of being in an airplane was intense and scary for the most part throughout the LONG night. Of course, sleep was out of the question and I was so wasted, I could barely communicate with my friend or even hear what he was saying. He seemed to be as uncomfortable as me and we both seemed to realize this was a mistake probably because of the large amount eaten.
