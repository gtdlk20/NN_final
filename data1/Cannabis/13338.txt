This goes on until the end of the movie. There are periods where I feel like I'm suffocating, where getting up is an elaborate coordination of mind and body, where my boyfriend and myself feel so unreal that I gotta poke them and hurt them to comprehend that they're there.... I'm not able to wait for things to go away because I can't perceive time.
