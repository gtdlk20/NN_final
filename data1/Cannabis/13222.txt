WOOSH.  I felt my body sink down and my mind shoot forward.  I was flying around everywhere - and I mean everywhere.  I was thinking about how my mind is faster than the speed of light because I can think of being somewhere else and I am instantly there.  I was flying around the cosmos and it was awesome!
