I felt light, floaty, spaced out and the sun got way brighter before burning. Everything kind of looks like glass, very bright, deep, and serious look to everything. As I was walking on the grass, I felt very relaxed witch made me want to lye down. After that happened, we start walking to the plaza to 'chill' since we had nothing better to do that day, stoned out of our minds. When we get to the plaza we sit down on the ledge and watch as people pull up to the plaza and people walking by us, it was so funny, I couldn't stop laughing, it was uncontrollable, but awesome. The high makes me feel more aware about everything, myself, as if I were someone else. Sometimes it literally feels like I am watching myself, or my eyes are ahead of me. It is hard to explain but it makes me feel like ' I am there' (sense of well-being). And the body high was great. Every ten seconds or so, my nerves feel like they are mildly shocking me, like a relaxing tingling. And the closed eye hallucinations are sick. I see a bunch of random things fly by me or like treadmill things or space objects circling around me, different trippy machines, shapes, etc. I start to think differently about things, like looking at people, or thinking about myself. Everything I see isnt changed, but it kind of looks funny because I think differently about the design or purpose. When I close my eyes when I'm high, I see yourself moving around like a ball, like I'm getting shaken around, exactly. Sometimes when I'm stoned I literally feel like my hands are made of paper and are floating by me when I walk, it feels good, and most effects are noticeable.
