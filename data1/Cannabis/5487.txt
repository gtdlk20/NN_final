My vision turned itself and confused the crap out of me. The only way I've found to explain this was that I wasn't looking down to look at the ground. If I wanted to look at the ground, I had to look to my right because that's where it was to me. A light was reflecting off of my girlfriend's hair (which she had up at the time) and when I noticed that, she immediately turned into a princess because I thought her hair was a crown of some sort. As soon as I saw the crown, I began to see her in a full princess costume. Things she was saying were becoming jumbled to me and I couldn't exactly understand her when she spoke, but my mind independently processed everything and I understood it somehow.
