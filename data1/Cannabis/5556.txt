3:00 AM - My heart is really beating quite heavily and quickly and has been for a while, now.  Being very comfortable with marijuana, I realize that this is a common thing for the dose I have taken and dismiss it before it can trouble me anymore.  I am still comming up.  I am already more stoned then I have ever been in my life (and IÂ’ve been smoking weed for years and years).  It is not a funny, ticklish stone, but a delerious and downright psychedelic stone.
