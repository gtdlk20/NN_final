Well, durin my trip, I was constantly in that state. I had an amazin feelin of bliss, a creative mindset and imagination that rivals the most abstract concepts and images found in dreams, and somehow more passive and relaxed than someone could be in the best massage chair ever built. I was in a constant artist's bliss. Images, sounds, ideas and dream-like thoughts were comin into my head every second, a lot of them often somehow bein related to the song that might've been playin at that moment. One of the most beautiful yet peculiar things that came up in my head is this music video-like scene of this mirror image of a green distorted girl dancin to the music, with bright yellows and greens flashin in the background. I have never felt a thing so artistic yet beautiful in my life, and the intensity of the feelin was somethin that rivals (not intendin to be vulgar) sexual pleasure - mainly orgasm, and although it is not as intense physically, my mind was just as delighted.
