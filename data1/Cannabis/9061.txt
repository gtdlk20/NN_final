My first time consisted of me and a few friends deciding to try out my friends new 2 foot multi chambered bong. I would say the quality of the marijuana was low grade nug/high mids. All I remember of the beginning was it was my first time using a bong, so I needed help getting it working. I sucked as hard as possible for as long as possible to get as much smoke in the bong as possible. I then pulled the choke and sucked in a huge glob of smoke, it didn't feel like much since it was cooled. But when I exhaled I shot out more smoke than I had ever seen anyone exhale.
