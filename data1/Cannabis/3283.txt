I smoked in the bathroom, with the shower on so no one would be able to smell it. My highs lately hadnt been doing much for me due to THC tolerance, so I made sure to breathe each hit deep into my lungs. I wasnt keeping track of how many hits Id taken, but I noticed something very strange about my surroundings that Id never noticed before about halfway through the bowl. This was not the usual distortion I experience while high; it was much more blurry andI dont know, it just felt a lot different. My pipe looked enormous. I decided I was too high to smoke the entire thing.
