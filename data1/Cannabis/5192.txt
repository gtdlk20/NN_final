In the bathroom I looked at my eyes, which were a pleasant shade of light pink. The red eye wasn't what made me look high though, it was my sunken eyes, and blank stare. I then did some light meditation in the bathroom (kinda strange, but the quietest part of the house). I turned my psyche into two parts, one that was on the trip and the other that was guiding my movements so I could function. When I walked out I took off my shoes and socks so I could feel the tacky shag carpet squish between my toes. Pure ecstasy. I was inspired to lay back on the carpet and take it in. As I did, a dozen little gnomes jumped out of their huts somewhere in my body and reupholstered my insides with the velvet they have on pool tables.
