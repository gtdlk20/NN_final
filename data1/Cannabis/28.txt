When I'm reading a book and my mind trails off - not necessarily away from the story, but doesnt literally read the words on the page.  Suddenly I find myself right at the bottom of a page I dont remember reading, but I know my eyes have scanned the words.  My brain has the words in it somewhere, but I have no real recollection of them.  I visit this frame of mind quite often when stoned.  It can often mean that I dont grasp whats going on in a film were watching, or understand what someone might have said to me, but as its only an intermittent thing, and not all night, its not a big problem, and can often lead to interesting adventures around my mind.  Its sort of like I'm sitting in the back of my head, watching my life play out on a cinema screen.  Thinking about whats happening, and leaving my body to react instinctively.
