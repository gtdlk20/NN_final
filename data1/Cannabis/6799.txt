My most recent time was one of the most intense. I had rolled a joint using a page from a 365 page-a-day calendar and tape; not the best joint. Nevertheless, it worked. I rolled one gram up and went out, telling my mom I was going out with some friends. I went for a walk to find a good place to smoke. Being that I had a joint, I knew it would be much less sketch to smoke in public, so I found a nice long street in a wooded area, struck a match, lit the end of the joint, and took in a nice big hit. I took several huge hits, but then I saw someone leave their house and start walking behind me. I quickly finished up the joint then stuffed the roach in an empty water bottle I was carrying. I continued to walk aimlessly, looking for a place to throw away my bottle because of the roach in it.
