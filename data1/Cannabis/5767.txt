As we headed back upstairs, I had this feelin of paranoia that lead me to believe that my friends were plannin somethin behind my back, and whenever I saw them talkin to each other, I somehow thought it was about me. I was even afraid to walk in front of them, for fear that they might do somethin behind my back, and I always wanted to walk behind them, so I could observe everythin they did. Then, they DID notice my paranoia, and one of them hid by a corner, jumped and scared me outta my lights - I let out a scream that could've woken up the dead. They laughed, and we eventually got to T's place, and sat down once again. Then we proceeded to play Need For Speed on T's Xbox, and somehow I was playin better than I ever was before. The controls seemed more natural to me, and yet, at the same time, I was still mad passive and relaxed, hypnotized by the game. The road in the game somehow seemed to be a path into another dimension. It felt like travellin through a tunnel.
