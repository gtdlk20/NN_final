I felt alone.  Very alone.  And I knew if my dad were to unexpectedly come home he'd know I was under the influence and I'd be dead.  I began to lay down on my bed and hopefully sleep off its effect.  But no, I was to energized to fall asleep and was scared as well.  Later that night I was still very buzzed but was coming down, and I ventured onto my computer.  I messaged my best friend and told her what I was feeling.  I felt like she was going to leave me and I would be alone.  I don't know why I felt like that, but I did.  She told me I was just having a bad high and repeatedly said she loved me.  For some odd reason I didn't believe her though... and at the point I just wanted the high to be over.
