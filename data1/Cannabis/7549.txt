It should also be noted that I have a very psychedelic mind.  I'm not even sure myself what a 'psychedelic mind' would really entail, only that thought processes are extremely visual to me.  Logical progressions, syllogisms, etc can only really be described with visual metaphor (by me anyway, and I'm the only one who was in my brain at the time so you'll just have to hang with it).  This is transcribed, word-for-word, from what I wrote in reflection on my experience.
