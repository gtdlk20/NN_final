When I could finally function, I was too tired to go downstairs. I was also hungry, and took solace in the munchies, one of the only familiar things about this high. I ate leftover popcorn and three granola bars. They tasted like candy. I remember watching a TV show, but couldnÂ’t follow the plot. I also recognized the amplification of taste and overall bleariness, which made me feel a little better. I was now coming down, but I still felt as high as I usually feel when I smoke.
