Once the universe S and I had created split like mitotically dividing cells, I looked for a new connection. This I found with my cousin R. It was not as intense an experience, and I believe this to be because R and I are so similar, whereas S and I were radically different. The resulting harmony then, was less of an awe inspiring event than it had been with S. Nevertheless, Rs connection was also with its uniqueness. R had been a drug addict before, and his addiction to heroin and the resulting damage to his life was one of the family tragedies I had spoken of. Here, I felt that I was journeying to a land that R had already seen - a mystical, secluded island in the universe for which there are no maps, no names, and no boundaries. I have since come to call this island Electric Ladyland in reference to Jimi Hendrixs album of the same name, as I felt it most accurately describes the place where many rock n rollers go and often become lost. Anyway, I felt a connection to R here, and I recognized him as a spirit companion to myself. I recognized that despite the difference in physical appearance between R and myself, our souls were drawn from the same spring, which had only produced enough water (soul) to fill two vessels. As such, making love to R was a celebration of the discovery that we were soul brothers, spirit companions - an innate and inseparable bond. R, interestingly, never receded from my awareness as he was truly a part of me that could never be rooted out. Having made this discovery, I turned to analyze my relationship with my one and only sibling, my sister T.
