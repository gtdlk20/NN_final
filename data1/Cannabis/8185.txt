Seconds later (real life : eight and a half hours later), i wake up to the alarm at 8:00 am.  i'm thinking about how weird i feel, but ascribe it to fatigue until i remember the cookies and the fact that i'm in New Jersey and not at home.  i realize i'm still high.  Still spun off my fucking wheels, in fact.  And that i have to go play piano at a church service, immediately.
