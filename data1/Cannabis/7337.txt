I have no idea how long I spent in the shower but when I got out and looked into the mirror a hallmate of mine looked into my eyes and smiled.  'Oh yeah' he said and I started laughing again. 'Yeah man, you know what's up.' I told him smiling.  The funniest thing when you're high is when you aren't sure if someone else knows if you are or aren't so you look at them and start laughing.
