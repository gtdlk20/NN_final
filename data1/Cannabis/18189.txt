We had reached my street and as I looked around I noticed a house that seemed to look exactly like mine except completely backwards, also the houses around it were similar to those around mine. At that moment  I could only think that I was in a universe that contradicted the one that I was in while I was sober. I told my friends my thoughts and they all seemed to agree. I then had a vision, but not a halucination about the future. In the vision we were sitting in my neighbors driveway at night rolling a joint when a cop car pulled up. At the time I thought nothing of it and proceeded rambling about my parallel universe.
