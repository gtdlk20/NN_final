Now, before I really start going into the experience I think it paramount to give you a little back ground on my experience with marijuana as well as myself to maybe help you gain perspective into my story. I am 18 years old. I have been smoking for almost 2 years. I have smoked some of the worst pot and some of the best pot, as well as everything between. From dead and brown Mersh to glowing red AK-47. I love the feeling of being high. I don't smoke because I'm addicted, I smoked because I feel it expands my thinking capability, allows my mind to think and feel in ways otherwise almost impossible. I will say in honesty, that since I have started smoking I have became considerably more intelligent. Whether I can solely attribute this to my smoking seems unreasonable, I have also gone through many life changing events that also could have helped to improve my intellect.
