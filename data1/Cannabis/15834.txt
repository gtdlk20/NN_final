It's probably very unclear, but the whole experience was extremely disturbing. Making the hallucinations change just by my will is something I never went through before. It was very exciting. The whole experience lasted for about 2 hours, and then I started to come down a little. I didn't understand that weed (and only one joint) could be such a powerful, mind altering drug. It raises a lot of questions about awareness. During the trip, I had moments when I felt I was going through a quasi-religious experience.
