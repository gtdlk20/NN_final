This is the last and final trip I had on that day.  I walked from the station through some woods to get to my house.  I've always wanted to trip in a forest, and I think I got my chance.  This time round I was actually SEEING things, not feeling them or them on the edge of my vision.  The nasty wind had gone, and now it was really quite a beautiful day.  The sun was shining through the leaves and hitting the ground and I could see where the light was making rays.  I glanced at the ground and I couldn't believe what I saw.  Where the light was hitting the ground I would see an image of a gorilla.  This made me think why am I seeing gorilla's on the ground?  I started to believe that perhaps the trees and plants were trying to communicate with us (and no I didn't start talking to the trees) in the only way which they could.  The trees would arrange their leaves in such a way so that they would create a template for the image of a gorilla to be transmitted onto the woodland, or forest floor.  Perhaps they're trying to tell us something about our evolution - because not only were there gorilla shapes that I saw... I saw various strange creatures I had never seen before.  I started to wonder why no one had ever seen this phenomenon before... perhaps pot is the key to seeing these silhouette figures on the ground, after all pot's a plant as well....
