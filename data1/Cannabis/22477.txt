After we all piled into the van, we drove off to find a place to skate.  While we were at a red light, I went into a trip where I thought i was talking out my window to a ticketman in his ticket booth. While talking to him about who knows what, I remember holding onto a pet alligator and petting it. Then right before the light turned green, I woke up to find that my pet alligator had dissapeared! I yelled out to my friends,'where did my pet alligator go?!' as if they knew. Then I explained to them what had just happened while we were at the red light. They just laughed at me and we drove on.
