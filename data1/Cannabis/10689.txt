All in all, it was probably the most intense marijuana experience I've ever had. I was really interested in the effects during the Pink Floyd songs. I had never really had any really psychedelic effects from marijuana, but it seemed as if the beautiful, mellow psychedelica that is Pink Floyd triggered a mild psychedelic experience. I think it was a very positive experience, having allowed me to feel, for those fleeting moments, complete and utter peace, without the fetters of the physical world and consensus reality. It has also caused me to have an even greater respect for and understanding of Pink Floyd's music, and a greater respect for this wonderful plant.
